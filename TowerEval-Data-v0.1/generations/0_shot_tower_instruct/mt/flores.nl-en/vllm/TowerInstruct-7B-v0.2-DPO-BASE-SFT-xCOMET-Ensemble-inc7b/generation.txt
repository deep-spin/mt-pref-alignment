The United States Olympic Committee has the support of USA Gymnastics and understands the need for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that it is in the best interest of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, to make meaningful changes to our organization rather than to pursue certification.

This not only proves the already widespread theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides more details than fossils, such as the color and three-dimensional placement.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
The researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development, as dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, or rachis, but do have other features of feathers - such as barbs.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but to regulate temperature or for display purposes. The researchers suggested that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, but this monster shows adult feathers and not the down of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, despite being the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen had the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chick.

The completed work was primarily theoretical in nature, but the program was written for the purpose of simulating observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The team was looking for the effect that would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the universe and that of the Milky Way.
Similar to how the moon exerts force on the Earth, leading to tides, the Milky Way exerts force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The researchers concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that it affects ordinary matter.
According to this theory, the majority of dark matter in a galaxy is located around it, in a kind of ring, and consists of a large number of smaller particles.

During the day they are cooler than the surrounding surface, and at night they are warmer.
"The thermal behavior of these features is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a temperature that is quite constant. What is consistent is that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting hardly requires any technology: voters go into a booth and put a pre-printed piece of paper into an envelope indicating which candidate they are voting for.
Officials first check the identity of the voter, then the voter slides the envelope into the ballot box and then signs the voting roll.
The process is relatively well defined in the electoral law of France.
Ballot boxes have been required to be transparent since 1988, so that both voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the start of the voting and that no envelopes are added other than those of registered and authorized voters.
The candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process, and volunteers count the votes at night under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

In the other race she participated in, the standing giant slalom, she was tenth among the women, with a combined time of 4:41:30. That is 2:11:60 minutes slower than the Austrian winner Claudia Loesch, and 1:09:02 minutes slower than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who finished ninth.
Four skiers from the women's slalom group were unable to finish their runs and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to qualify during the race.
The stolen laptop and mobile phone have been found by the police of Madhya Pradesh.
According to assistant inspector general D. K. Arya, five of the rapists of the Swedish woman have been arrested and they have found her mobile phone and laptop.
Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar are the suspects.
According to police commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the suspects covered their faces when they appeared in court.
There were three people in the house when the car hit it, but none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services tried to free the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially he was taken to Great Yarmouth's James Paget Hospital.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been convicted in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court for the murder of her son.
She is in custody pending charges and trial, but the eyewitness account may be a fabrication because her story has been published many times.
This is standard practice in the rest of the UK, but justice in Scotland works differently and courts have deemed the publication of photos as potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that 'journalists are playing a dangerous game when they publish photos etc. of suspects.'
The Crown Office is in overall charge of prosecutions and has told journalists that no further statements will be made, at least until charges are laid.
According to sources, the document refers to a settlement of disputes, something that the Palestinians have been eager to achieve based on the borders before the war in the Middle East in 1967.
Other topics discussed were the future status of Jerusalem, a city that is holy to both peoples, and the problems in the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands that there be a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of an agreement, but the PA is only willing to agree to a presence of five years.
Archers in the supplementary test for pest control had to be closely monitored by forest rangers. The test was indeed followed and its effectiveness was assessed.
In a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director for park conservation and heritage at the NPWS, the four chosen shooters for the first shooting operation have had extensive safety and training instructions.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a nine-member new provisional electoral council (Provisional Electoral Council of CEP).
With this, Martelly has achieved a CEP five times in the past four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous National Electoral Council, as part of a package of measures to bring new elections to the country.
The commission was established by Martelly in response to widespread protests against the government that have taken place since October.
The sometimes violent protests arose from the lack of elections, some of which should have taken place since 2011.
About 60 cases have been reported of iPods malfunctioning and overheating, leading to six fires and four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of the 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company called "not serious."
‘Very regrettable’, was the response of the ministry to the fact that Apple has delayed the report.
Mariana was hit by the earthquake at 07.19 local time (Friday 21.19 GMT).
The emergency management bureau of the Northern Mariana Islands stated that no damage has been reported nationwide.
In addition, the National Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no tsunami warning.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former police officer from the Philippines has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been brought to safety and so far at least six fatalities have been confirmed.
Six hostages were released earlier, including children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers returned in exchange for an elderly woman who needed to use the toilet. Mendoza was eventually shot.
Liggins went into medicine, following in his father's footsteps.
Trained as a midwife, he started working in the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins conducted research on premature birth in his free time.
His research showed that the maturation of the foetal lungs of babies was accelerated by the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black boxes" with flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, 'Luna was the first 'Queen of Extreme'. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons. As unique as she was. A strong woman.'
Dustin 'Goldust' Runnels said that 'Luna was just as weird as me... maybe even weirder... I love her and will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place'.
Of the 1,400 people surveyed for the 2010 federal election, the number who opposed Australia becoming a republic rose by 8 per cent since 2008.
Outgoing Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the campaign for the 2010 federal elections that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of the participants in this poll supported this position. They want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
Twenty-nine percent of respondents thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent said it should never happen.
The Olympic gold medallist swam the 100 and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was called into question due to his complaints.
He was unable to take the medication he needed to alleviate his pain because it is banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the currently largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery at the beginning of February using different hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source of water on Earth, along with organic material that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to gain insight into how planets are formed. They are particularly interested in how the Earth was formed, given that it has been a very long time since comets collided with the Earth.
Cuomo (53) was inaugurated as governor earlier this year and last month signed a law that legalises marriages between people of the same sex.
He called the rumours 'political nonsense and gossip'.
It is speculated that he wants to run for president in 2016.
With the NextGen system, planes could take shorter routes, according to the FAA, which could save millions of tons of fuel each year and lower carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older technologies using ground radar, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft much more accurately, and provide pilots with clearer information.
No additional transport is being deployed and no above-ground trains will stop at Wembley; in addition, the parking lots and the P&R are not accessible on the site.
A possible lack of transportation increased the likelihood that the match would be played behind closed doors and without supporters.
A study published in the scientific journal Science on Tuesday was about the formation of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved within two generations. It was thought that this process took much longer because the crossing of a native Darwin finch, the Median ground finch, with an immigrated Cactus ground finch, the Española ground finch, took longer.
Gold can be processed into many forms. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can also be forged or rolled into plates.
Once made very thin, it could be pasted onto another metal. It could even be made so thin that it was sometimes used for the decoration of hand-painted illustrations in books known as 'illuminated manuscripts'.
This is called the pH value of a chemical substance. You can already make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of the cabbage juice then changes based on the acidity (acid to basic or alkaline) of the chemical.
The pH value is indicated based on the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance that has been tested.
Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron, and hydrogen ions are protons without electrons.
Mix both dry powders together, make your hands wet and clean, and form a ball.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjodaro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to an advanced sewage system.
Sewage remains have been found in houses in the Minoan cities on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
Furthermore, there were already toilets in China, Egypt and Persia in ancient times. For example, in the Roman era, toilets were often part of a public bathhouse, where both men and women gathered in a mixed group.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
As soon as the space satellite receives the call, it is immediately returned.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and images.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, you need a huge rocket that is more than 30 meters long.
The wheel has changed the world incredibly. The most important thing the wheel has given us is easier and faster transportation.
The train, the car and many other means of transport are the result of this.
There are medium-sized feline predators that feed on medium-sized prey, from hares to antelopes and deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (such as feral cats kept as pets) that hunt in larger numbers on small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
Their success stems from the idea of a niche, a special job that every cat has, so they don't compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called prides.
Troops consist of one to three adult males who are related to each other and also have up to thirty females and cubs.
The women are normally closely related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions behaves much like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that resemble lions (but not other big cats) surprisingly, and that are very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (although not well), swim, jump long distances and has five times the pulling power of a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger does not roar with full power like a lion. It is more like he growls a whole sentence.
Ocelots' favorite meal is small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. The ocelot hunts almost exclusively on animals that are much smaller than itself.
Scholars suspect that ocelots use their sense of smell to hunt small animals (their prey) by smelling the ground where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision and move very quietly. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes detached from the larger population it came from (for example, by moving over a mountain range or river, or being moved to a different island from which it cannot easily return), it is often in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, other resources and other enemies are present, so the new population must adapt or change their behavior in order to be able to compete.
Because they still need the same adaptations as before, the original population has not changed at all.
As the new population began to adapt to their new environment, they also began to look less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different in appearance that you can no longer call them the same species.
This process is called speciation and simply involves the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe in and they absorb carbon dioxide that people exhale.
Through photosynthesis, the plants obtain their nutrients from the sun and also provide shade.
Our houses and clothes are made of plants. We mainly eat plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain of that time. It had nothing to fear from anyone, except from other Mosasauruses.
His long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an extra set in the palate, which means that nothing or no one could escape him.
It is not certain, but it is possible that his tongue was forked. It ate turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and perhaps even its own kind.
Nothing was safe from his attacks in bodies of water; even giant dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex were no match for him.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans also had their fair share of exotic or unusual delicacies, including wild boar, peacocks, snails and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
In addition, there was another difference; poor people and women sat on chairs while eating, but wealthy men liked to hold banquets where they would lie on their sides while eating.
Meals from Roman times do not contain food that came from America or Asia to Europe in later centuries.
For example, they did not have maize, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa. Furthermore, not a single ancient Roman ever ate turkey.
The Babylonians made a primary temple for all their gods. This temple was seen as the god's own home.
Offerings were made to the gods and the priests tried to satisfy the needs of the gods by organizing ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had a public courtyard and a back room that was only accessible to priests.
Sometimes, as part of the temples, towers in the shape of pyramids were built, called ziggoerattes.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
Houses were not of great importance in the warm climate of the Middle East.
The daily life of the Hebrew family often took place outside.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were no more than a counter along the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, and so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland had few inhabitants. According to Norwegian legends, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, found Greenland on his way west, and gave it its name.
He made this discovery, but Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although they were all 'Scandinavian' countries, the people, the royal family, customs and history of Sweden, Iceland, Denmark and Norway were very different from each other.
After the movie National Treasure, you might think there is a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is a misconception. There is indeed something written on the back, but it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the American Declaration of Independence are the words 'Original Declaration of Independence, July 4th, 1776'. The text is upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one is certain who wrote it, it is certain that the large parchment (29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was once rolled up for storage.
It therefore seems that the designation was simply added as a kind of label.
Thanks to the D-Day landings and the subsequent battles, the north of France was liberated. However, the south remained occupied.
It was ruled by Vichy France. These were French people who, in 1940, sided with the Germans and therefore collaborated with the enemy instead of fighting against them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France with Operation Dragoon.
The Americans and the Free French had liberated southern France in just two weeks, and then they set off for Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together in a society.
The term civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civilian, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state; and this also defines the format of society in a certain way.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilization with a culture suggests that knowledge is passed down over multiple generations, leaving a lasting cultural footprint and balanced distribution.
When minority cultures disappear, they often leave no relevant historical evidence behind, which is why they are not officially recognized as civilizations.
During the revolution, thirteen states, under the Articles of Confederation, formed a weak central government consisting only of a congress.
The congress lacked the power to levy taxes because there was no national executive or judicial authority, and in order to implement all its decisions it relied on state authorities, which often did not cooperate.
It also did not have the authority to ignore tax laws and rates between states.
At first, all states had to unanimously agree to the articles before they could be amended, but the states did not take the national government so seriously, which meant that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German team, is the second most successful team worldwide and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are extremely popular, especially in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan consists of almost 7,000 islands (with Honshu as the largest island). This makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
Due to the cluster/group of islands Japan possesses, Japan is often referred to geographically as a 'peninsula'
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century, when sailors from Europe sailed past the island and gave it the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch VOC established itself in the southwest of Taiwan as a base, where the VOC tackled the indigenous grain production processes and employed Chinese workers on rice and sugar plantations.
In the year 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan were conquered by troops of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912), after which Taiwan was annexed in the year 1885 as a province of the Qing Empire.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, which transferred sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Built from three large structures, Machu Picchu consists of Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room with Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt so that tourists can get a better idea of what they used to look like.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored. The renovation is still ongoing.
For example, the most common photo format for still images worldwide is 35 mm, which was the usual film format at the end of the analogue film era.
These are still produced today, although it is mainly the image ratio that the image sensor of the digital camera has adopted.
Strangely enough, 35 mm film is actually 36 mm wide, with a height of 24 mm.
The aspect ratio of this size (divide by twelve to get the simplest ratio of whole numbers) would be 3:2 in this case.
Many common formats (such as APS-like formats) are equal to or a close approximation of this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is often abused and ridiculed by many, is a simple guideline that makes the image dynamic, yet also clear.
The most effective placement for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines. This divides the image into three parts, vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in the history of Europe, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was under fire.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united European states, despite differences in language and customs.
From the king to the common citizen, his all-pervasive power affected everyone.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to combat suffering and poverty, and the church has resources for this reason.
The church had been the central authority in Rome for over a thousand years, and this relationship of power and money led many people to question whether this principle was being upheld.
Great Britain established a blockade at sea aimed at Germany, shortly after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy proved effective, as it was no longer possible to deliver vital supplies to the military and civilians. However, this blockade violated the generally accepted international law that has been established over the past two centuries in various international agreements.
Great Britain has placed mines in international waters, so that ships could no longer sail in large parts of the ocean, which was even dangerous for neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to the country's unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations had a pacifist and isolationist attitude.
After the First World War, states wanted to prevent such horrors from ever happening again.
Tesla emigrated to the United States of America in 1884 to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
When he came to the United States, he had only 4 cents, a collection of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) for Thomas Edison with him.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each phase of China or each ruling family had a distinct dynasty.
There was also a period of instability between the different dynasties, during which the provinces were divided. The most famous period was the Three Kingdoms era, which took place in the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
At that time, there were fierce wars between different nobles who fought for the throne.
In the history of ancient China, the era of the Three Kingdoms is known as one of the bloodiest. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest position in the great palace in Xi'an.
The Revolution had major social and political consequences, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolute monarchy to republicanism, nationalism and the idea that the land belongs to its inhabitants rather than a single leader.
For all male applicants, positions were available after the revolution, so that the most ambitious and suitable candidates could succeed.
The same applies to the army. Army ranks are no longer based on a person's class, but on the person's caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working class in other countries to revolt.
Muhammad was intensely involved in matters of the spirit world. He often went to a cave for contemplation, which later became known as the Cave of Hira in the Mountains of Noer.
The cave itself, which has withstood the test of time, gives a very vivid picture of the spirituality of Muhammad.
The cave is located on one of the mountain peaks on the north side of Mecca and is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
Even though it was known that the cave existed, it was not easy to find at all. Once inside the cave, there is total isolation.
The only thing you can see is the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. From the cave, there is very little of this world to see or hear.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still stands.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC and is one of the many large pyramid structures built in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or 'pyramids of Giza' in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings contains several pyramids (with the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, a number of temples and the great sphinx.
The large pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, while many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built as tributes to Khufu's wives and family members.
The up-bow sign looks like a V and the down-bow sign looks like a dot or a square with the bottom missing.
Above means you should start at the dot and push the wand away. Below means you should start at the bow frog (the place where your hand holds the wand) and pull the wand.
An upward movement usually produces a softer sound, while a downward movement produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
Take the liberty to sketch your personal marks, but don't forget that the printed rests are there for a musical reason, so they usually have to be respected.
A group of market women sat on October 6, 1789, behind the departure of the terrified Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Therese, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, from Versailles to Paris.
They travelled back to the French capital in a carriage, surrounded by jeering and threatening mobs who threatened the royal couple.
The actions of the crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At one point, someone in the crowd held up the head of a royal guard who had been murdered in Versailles in front of the eyes of a terrified queen.
The war costs of the U.S. imperialism in relation to the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the people of the Philippines.
They were required to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to finance a large part of the costs, and the interest on bonds was issued through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government.
American imperialism rested in large part on the enormous profits of the long-term exploitation of the Philippines.
To understand the Templars, one must know the context that gave rise to the order.
The era in which this happened is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the European history of the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
After the early Middle Ages came the high Middle Ages, which were in turn followed by the late Middle Ages, which usually ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term for a wide range of ideas in practice: from technology offerings or the technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their appearance in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism hold these two general views: the development of technology follows a trajectory that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, some will say that the arrival of the car automatically leads to the construction of roads.
A national road network is economically unfeasible for just a few cars, however, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to more accidents on the road, which in turn leads to the development of new healthcare techniques to help the human body recover.
In romanticism, a large part of cultural determinism was included, which came from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In Romanticism, geography shaped the individual and over time, customs and cultures emerged as a result of this geography, forming a harmonious society that was better than arbitrary laws imposed from above.
Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe, just as Paris is the current fashion capital.
It was known as an epicenter of luxury from around 400 AD to around 1100 AD.
The status of the empire declined in the 12th century, mainly because the crusaders returned with silk and spices that were more valuable than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
Around this time, Paris also took over the title of fashion capital from Constantinople.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the 10th, 11th and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture from the east.
However, due to the slow communication channels, styles in the west were 25 to 30 years behind.
At the end of the Middle Ages, a distinct style began to emerge in Western Europe. One of the biggest developments was the result of the Crusades: people started using buttons to fasten their clothing.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture in which enough food is produced to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Agriculture for subsistence is a simple system that is usually organic, using saved seed from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers worked in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by societal norms, giving them the opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender of their members.
A subculture can be defined by the following types of qualities: linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic or a combination of one or more of these factors.
Members of a subculture often show which group they belong to through a certain symbolic style in what they wear, in how they behave and the jargon they speak.
One of the most commonly used methods of illustrating the importance of socialisation was the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, adversity or deliberate abuse during their upbringing, were not socialised by adults.
They are called 'wolf children' or 'feral children'. Some wolf children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); sometimes this child was abandoned because the parents did not want to accept the serious mental or physical disability of the child.
Troublesome children may have experienced serious child abuse or serious trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived in the wilderness alone.
A feral child who has not been raised by humans may exhibit behavior that resembles the behavior of the animal that raised it (within physical limits), such as fear of or indifference towards humans.
Learning on a project basis should simplify education and make it more interesting, but scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a tool to support individuals who are facing a new learning experience, for example a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real. A teacher is, for example, a form of support, but the paperclip in Microsoft Office is too.
There is virtual scaffolding built into the software that asks questions, provides memory cues and explains procedures that might be difficult for students to understand without help.
There are various reasons why children end up in foster care, such as neglect, abuse and exploitation.
No child should have to grow up in an environment where they are not well cared for, where they are not loved and where they cannot develop, but this is happening.
We consider the foster care system to be a safe zone for these children.
The intention is for foster care to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable healthcare.
In foster care, all needs that were neglected in the previous home must be met.
On the internet, elements of interpersonal and mass communication are combined.
The different characters of the internet lead to new dimensions in the application of the Uses & Gratifications theory.
'Learning' and 'socialisation', for example, are presented as important reasons for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) introduced new motivational aspects such as 'personal involvement' and 'ongoing relationships' when they examined audience responses to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to remarkable findings in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
It is stated, in particular, that no one can recognize a lie by simply paying attention to micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks described in his essay The President's Speech how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can nevertheless accurately gauge its sincerity.
He even suggested that other species, such as domestic dogs, also have the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variants: hidden and visible.
Through mutation, new genetic variation is added; through selection, this variation is eliminated from the pool of expressed variation.
For each generation, there is variation between the two groups through separation and recombination.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans can survive in the savannah, but it is difficult for it to obtain the necessary amino acids from the plant sources found there.
Failure to comply can have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The easiest plant sources to find are the proteins in leaves and legumes, but unless they are cooked, they are difficult to digest for primates like us.
Not only is animal food (ants, termites, eggs) easily digestible, but it also contains a lot of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
All in all, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their 'protein problem' in the same way that chimpanzees in the savannah solve this problem today.
Sleep interruption means that you wake up for a reason during your normal sleep period and fall asleep again within a short time (10–60 minutes).
This is quite easy by using a relatively soft alarm that brings you back to consciousness without immediately waking you up completely.
If you want to set your clock while you sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on the biorhythm are, for example, drinking a lot of liquid before going to bed (and in particular water or tea, a well-known diuretic). This means you will need to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner calm a person possesses is in contrast to the amount of stress a person carries in their body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive the life force present. Every human being is capable of achieving contentment and total peace.
Anyone can enlighten their mind. Only your own stress and negativity stand in the way of this goal.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but this form of Buddhism has been expanded with the Mahayana path of love and with a large number of techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism consists of a relatively simple core of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the pursuit of universal love.
Through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualized images, the energy of Kundalini yoga (enlightenment energy) is awakened.
The core of Tibetan meditation is yoga with a deity as the focus. Using the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and consciousness is brought into an enlightened state.
Because Germany was a common enemy during World War II, cooperation between the USSR and the US was established. After the war, conflicts between the system, process, and culture caused the countries to fall out with each other.
The former allies stood opposite each other two years after the end of the war, this was the beginning of the Cold War.
The war would last 40 years and there were proxy battles fought on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
The Polish defensive forces held out until 17 September 1939, after which they had to retreat and reorganise along the bridgehead in Romania.
However, these plans were undone in one night when 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded and formed the Latvian and Ukrainian fronts, after occupying the eastern parts of Poland, in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international peace treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Shipping goods by ship is the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, it is the task of the navy to ensure that a country retains the ability to transport people and goods, while the ability of the enemy to transport people and goods is hindered.
The US tried to get troops and equipment across the Atlantic to the British, and this North Atlantic campaign of WWII is one of the most remarkable recent examples.
The German navy tried to stop this traffic at the same time, mainly with U-boats.
Like the rest of Europe, Britain would probably have fallen into German hands if the Allies had failed.
It seems that the goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Iranian Zagros Mountains.
In ancient times, cultures and tribes started to keep them so that they could always easily get their hair, meat, milk and hides.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds on a hill or other grazing area, guarded by goat herders, often a child or young person, just like the more well-known shepherd. Today, they are still guarded in the same way.
Horse-drawn railways were already being built in England in the 16th century.
Although horse railways consisted of only a rail of planks, the horses had to run faster and pull larger amounts than on the somewhat difficult roads of that time.
Crossbars were used quite early on to keep the rails in place, but gradually it was realised that rails would be more efficient if there was an iron point on the top.
This quickly became the standard practice, but the iron resulted in more wear and tear on the wooden carriage wheels.
Iron wheels eventually replaced the wooden variants. In 1767, the first completely iron rails were laid.
The first form of transport we know is walking. People started walking upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus appeared (which means upright man).
Their predecessor, the Australopithecus, walked upright less often.
Bipedal specializations are found in fossils of the Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago. The Sahelanthropus may have also walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can live in a more environmentally friendly way, join an environmental movement or even take action to mitigate future suffering.
In many cases, it is just like a symptomatic treatment. But if we want more than a temporary solution, we must identify the cause of the problems and eliminate it.
The scientific and technological developments of human society have obviously changed the earth profoundly. Moreover, overpopulation and the extravagant human lifestyle have aggravated the problems.
After the Declaration of Independence was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap a few blocks away. This draft was signed by the President of the Continental Congress John Hancock and minister Charles Thomson.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, and are now better known as 'Dunlap broadsides'.
John Nixon first delivered the public reading of the document on July 8 in the garden of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6 and read to his troops in New York on July 9. Another copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists believe that a dinosaur species still exists today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them to be dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still make them seem like dinosaurs.
They have claws and scales on their feet, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs, just like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Manipulating data encoded in binary digits forms the basis for almost all computers used today.
A binary number can only have two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits (and in computer language 'bits').
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The presence of open boxes of medication or toxic household chemicals is the best indicator of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
This group of insects is formally called 'true bugs' by entomologists.
This term comes from an ancient agreement with bed bugs, which are insects that can parasitize humans very well.
Both bed bugs and cockroaches are nest-bound; they have adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
In the US, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological condition in adults of both younger and middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or that of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to give up their baby for adoption.
In the case of adoption, the parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can raise the child.
Discovering how the world works through the scientific method is the primary goal of science. This method is the guiding principle for most scientific research.
However, it is about more than just experiments; an experiment is a test to rule out one or more potential assumptions, to raise questions and to make observations, as a guide for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and in particular the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on science, including psychology, were accepted.
The West understood Greek philosophy and science less and less as knowledge of the Greek language decreased.
In physiological and behavioral observations of rhythms, there is often a strong dependence on endogenous processes and production via the biological clock.
Most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, live according to periodic rhythms. These are not just responses to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-contained oscillators that go through a cycle for a certain period of time, even if there are no external signals for it.
The experiment of Hershey and Chase was one of the most important indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were carried out, in one experiment the DNA in the phage was labelled with radioactive phosphorus and in the other experiment the protein of the phage was labelled with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type, the importance of the genetic material involved and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells are hereditary. Other mutations can cause cells to die or can lead to cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who like to visit natural areas because they want to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
On site, one can hunt, fish, take photographs, observe birds, visit parks and study the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing and learning about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people from small villages drive to their workplace and pass people whose workplace is located in the village they just came from.
Everyone in this dynamic transport shuttle is in some way connected to and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science shows that this enormous carbon economy has taken the biosphere out of the stable state in which human evolution has occurred over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems, and almost everyone complains about them.
In developed countries, problems with water quality or collapsing bridges are rarely seen.
How is it that so many complaints arise in transport systems, why does it go wrong on a daily basis? Are transport technicians simply incompetent, or is it something more fundamental?
In a traffic flow, attention is paid to the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between the individuals.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to examine traffic flow, because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave in a relatively predictable manner. This means that traffic flows show a certain degree of consistency, and that there is something to be said about this in mathematical terms.
The three core characteristics have been linked to better represent traffic flow: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships make it easier to plan, design and operate road engineering facilities.
Insects were the first animals to learn how to fly. Thanks to their ability to fly, they could more easily escape from predators and find food and mating partners more efficiently.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along their body.
This allows them to hide from predators in a larger number of small places.
Currently, only dragonflies and mayflies cannot fold their wings.
A few thousand years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
There were people who thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system moved around the Earth, and the Sun as well (and other stars).
This sounds fairly logical, because you don't feel that the earth is moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the world's largest and second-longest river and carries more than 8 times as much water as the second-largest.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, and in some places it is six miles wide.
At least 20% of all the water that flows into the sea via the rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. The water comes from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remain unsurpassed in terms of size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monument of their predecessors, which was already more than a thousand years old.
There are approximately 800 inhabitants living in Vatican City. This is the smallest independent country in the entire world and also the country with the lowest population.
Italian is the official language for communication and laws in Vatican City.
Italian is the language most commonly spoken by the people who work there, while Latin is used a lot during religious ceremonies.
Everyone who lives in Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People have known the most basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver and copper, since ancient times, because they can all be found in nature and it is relatively easy to extract them with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle speculated that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This seemed more like what we know of the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, but he also theorized that they transition into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are, in simple terms, a combination of at least two metals. As you probably know, the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium fall under the metals. There are also metals such as silver and gold, of course.
Alloys can also contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, for example carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a trillion atoms would fit at the tip of the end of this sentence.
That is why the pencil was a faithful friend to many people when it was launched.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods have emerged, the pen has been demoted in status and is used much less frequently.
Nowadays, messages are written on a computer screen without ever needing a pencil sharpener.
You might wonder what will happen to the keyboard once something new comes onto the market.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it costs energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's as if you are pushing a heavy cart up a hill. When the core is split up again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means that they fall apart at the slightest provocation.
The surface of the moon is characterized by dust and rock. The crust is the outer layer of the moon.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km thick on the other side.
The crust is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more mares on the side, because the crust is thinner there and lava could more easily reach the surface.
Content theories are aimed at discovering what moves people and what appeals to them.
This theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they grow up.
With these theories, they want to examine the reasons why certain people want certain things and which environmental factors influence them to do certain things or not.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's motivation-hygiene theory.
In general, two approaches emerge when managers are put in charge of their former colleagues. In one approach, they try to act as equals.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions and take disciplinary measures, to hold evaluation meetings, to delegate and to hold people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, this person transforms into an unrecognizable individual, feeling the need to change everything the team has done so far and wanting to take ownership of everything.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to a gap between leaders and team members.
Virtual teams must meet the same standards of excellence as regular teams, although there are some small differences.
In most cases, virtual team members are the first point of contact for their direct physical group.
They are often more independent than traditional team members, because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The idea of a truly 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, pp 109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to whom each member reports. The invisible team also sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organization want to start the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One of the goals for putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and resourcefulness come to light when all available resources within the functional departments of an organization are effectively deployed.
The result of this is that the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
To enable innovation in an organization, management must foster a culture in which innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning are central.
According to Angel (2006), organizations can perform better with an approach based on the continuum model.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, allowing the research field to be narrowed down and more accurate data to be collected.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, wounds and tumors can affect behavior and lead to changes in mental capacity.
As more and more new technologies are developed, we are learning more and more about the structures and processes in the brain.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to develop simulation models that give us more insight into the processes of our mind.
AI immediately brings to mind science fiction for most people, but it is also an essential part of computer science. It is used in research into machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Developing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior falls under research into AI.
Some examples are management, planning, the ability to diagnose and answer customer questions, and the recognition of handwriting, voice, and face.
These have become separate disciplines for finding solutions to problems in real life.
Today, this system for artificial intelligence is widely used in economic, medical, technical and military fields, such as in various software applications for PCs and video games.
Many excursions are planned for each class, and often a teacher would take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Thanks to technological developments, virtual excursions are now possible, allowing students to view artefacts in a museum, take a peek inside an aquarium or see beautiful works of art from the classroom.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a fantastic way to look back on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital every year, which is redesigned every year and previous versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students to write better. Often, their grammar and spelling are poor at the beginning, but this changes quickly because they have an audience.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
By blogging, "students are also forced to learn more about the world around them". The need to keep the audience interested inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
When used properly, blogs can help students develop analytical skills and critical thinking; by actively engaging in discussion on the internet, students can find their place in the context of others' material and at the same time determine their own stance on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
The bilingual capital of Canada is the charming Ottawa, full of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and future.
Further south you will find the Niagara Falls. In the north you will find the beautiful unspoiled Muskoka and much more.
This kind of thing makes Ontario seem typically Canadian to outsiders.
Further north, large areas are sparsely populated and parts of these areas are even virtually uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that will surprise many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than the total population of Canada.
The East African islands are located along the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and in terms of fauna it is almost a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or are connected to France and are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought the Islamic faith with them, which then spread widely across the Comoros and Mayotte.
The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India, which marked the beginning of European influence and colonization in the 15th century.
The region is bordered to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean and to the north by the Sahel region.
Women: female travelers are advised to say they are married, whether or not it is true.
It also helps to put on rings (not too expensive looking rings).
Women should be aware that cultural differences may lead to behaviour that they perceive as intimidating, and that it is common to be followed, to have your arm taken, etc.
Be clear when you reject a man and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences don't make this easy!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen. The city was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids and was known under the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the harbor and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca. After an earthquake in 1755, they left the city again.
The sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and named it Daru l-Bayad. The Spanish traders who established their trading base here gave it the name Casablanca.
In Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
Around the old Medina you will find many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan items, such as tagines, pots, leather products, water pipes and other trinkets, but it is purely aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The city is located near Rwanda, in the far east.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed when the Nyiragongo volcano spewed lava, burying most of the city's streets, particularly the city center.
Although Goma itself is relatively safe, you should check the situation regarding the ongoing fighting in the province of North Kivu before visiting any places outside Goma.
In addition, the city serves as a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and you can find some of the most affordable trips for tracking mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can get around Goma using a boda-boda (a motorcycle taxi). The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese Francs for the short ride.
'Timbuktu' is relatively poorly accessible and is therefore nowadays used as a metaphor for exotic, far-off countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a deprived city, but its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites due to desert storms.
It was one of the main stops on the PBS exhibition Special Wonders from the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city differs from the other cities in the country, as it has a more Arabic appearance than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique in the east, along the border with Zimbabwe in the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park is 19,500 square kilometres in size, divided into 14 different eco-zones, where various wild animal species are kept.
As a major attraction in South Africa, this park is the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, daily conservation fees and entrance fees apply.
It can also be useful to buy a Wild Card, which offers access to certain parts of parks in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
The entire territory of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, which is considered by many tourists to be the most important place.
The vast number of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a glittering bar graph that is visible thanks to the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the waterfront of Kowloon on the other side.
The vast majority of the population of the island of Hong Kong lives very close to each other on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is where the British settlers established themselves, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forests in the world and stretch 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into Indian and Bangladeshi territory.
The Sundarbans are now officially included on the UNESCO World Heritage list. The part within Indian borders is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are more than just mangrove swamps — they also contain some of the last mighty tracts of jungle that ever covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which a third is peat and marshland.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife reserve since 1966 and there are now an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 axis deer in the area.
During the day, buses depart from the station on the border of the districts (opposite the river). Most depart between 6.30 and 7.30 am, especially in the direction of the east and Jakar/Bumthang.
It is wise to buy a ticket a few days in advance, because the local buses are often fully booked.
In most neighborhoods, small Japanese Coaster buses drive around, which are comfortable and sturdy.
With shared taxis, you can travel quickly and comfortably to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable bridge that crosses the Oyapock River to connect the Brazilian city of Oiapoque and the French Guyanese city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock.
The two towers are 83 metres high. The building is 378 metres long and has two passages with a width of 3.50 metres.
The clearance height under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction of the bridge was completed in August 2011, but it only opened to traffic in March 2017.
According to the plan, the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, and the Brazilian customs posts are expected to be ready for use by then.
The Guaraní were the most prominent indigenous group. They lived in the area that is now East Paraguay, lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
In the province of Chaco, other indigenous tribes lived, including the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who found their food by hunting, fishing and gathering.
Paraguay, also known as the 'great province of India', emerged in the 16th century when Spanish colonizers encountered the indigenous population.
This was followed by a three-century period of colonisation under the Spanish.
Asunción was founded in 1537 and since then Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year takes place on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be seen here at other times of the year.
Check the Asociación Argentina de Polo for more information about tournaments and buying tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP). Its value is approximately equal to one British pound (GBP).
There is only one bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store, where you can exchange money.
In general, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands and in Stanley you can often also pay with credit cards and American dollars.
On the remote islands, you probably can't pay with a credit card, but you can probably pay with British and American currency. Ask the owners in advance about the payment options.
Exchange your money again before leaving the islands, as Falkland currency is very difficult to exchange outside.
Montevideo is below the equator, so when it is summer there, it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months, temperatures of over +30°C are not uncommon.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature almost never drops below zero, but the wind in combination with the humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
The level of rainfall remains approximately the same throughout the year, without recognizable 'wet' and 'dry' periods.
Many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, but wild animals are ultimately just that: wild. That is why they should not be fed or disturbed.
Keep at least 100 metres away from bears and wolves, and 25 metres away from all other wild animals in the park.
Elks, bison, reindeer, bears and pretty much all other large animals can attack you, no matter how tame they may seem.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they don't keep a proper distance. These animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Furthermore, you should be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia and the city with almost 40,000 inhabitants is located on the island of Upolu.
Around the year 1850, Apia was founded and it has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, seven ships from Germany, the US and Great Britain refused to leave the harbour. This later became known as the infamous standoff.
With the exception of a British battleship, all ships were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the struggle for independence by the Mau movement, the highest leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, died in a violent non-violent gathering in the city.
There are many beaches, particularly due to the two harbours of Auckland. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore in the North Harbour district stretch from north to south along the Pacific Ocean, from Long Bay to Devonport.
These are almost all sandy beaches where it is safe to swim and most have pohutukawa trees that provide shade.
At Waitemata's harbour, in the luxurious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, located in Central Auckland, you will find the Tamaki Drive beaches.
These family beaches are sometimes crowded and have a good range of shops on the coast. Swimming is not unsafe.
'Number One' is the most important local beer, which is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called 'Manta'.
There are plenty of French wines to be found, but New Zealand and Australian wines are perhaps better suited for travel.
The local drinking water can be safely consumed, but bottled water is also easy to find if you don't trust it.
A 'flat white' is a strange concept for Australians. Black coffee is 'espresso', cappuccino has a lot of coffee milk (without foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian quality. Fruit juices are expensive, but great.
Trips to the reef occur throughout the year and injuries resulting from these trips to the reef are rare.
Ask for expert advice and follow all signs and safety warnings.
Cubozoans are found near beaches and river mouths north of Town of 1770 from October to April, but sometimes they are also found outside of this period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
The main habitat of saltwater crocodiles is in the river mouths north of Rockhampton and they do not normally live in the ocean.
Making a reservation in advance provides peace of mind for the traveler, knowing that they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have deals with certain hotels, although you can usually also book other types of accommodation, such as a campsite, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages with breakfast and transport to and from the airport, and sometimes even packages with flights and hotels.
They can also hold your reservation if you need a little more time to think about the offer or if you need to obtain documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, if you have a request or want to make a change, you must do so through the travel agency rather than the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of attendees at music festivals choose to camp on site and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to be early to secure a campsite near the music.
And remember this: even when the music on the main stages has finished, there may still be music playing on other parts of the festival site until late at night.
For families with young children, there are special camping areas at some festivals.
Be careful where you sit when crossing the Baltic Sea in winter, because the ice makes a tremendous noise if you are too close.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time to explore the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos are usually committed to getting the most out of the time and money that guests spend. Windows and clocks are usually not present, and the exit is sometimes difficult to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drink and entertainment to keep them happy and prevent them from leaving.
Some venues offer free alcoholic drinks, but when people are drunk it affects their judgement and all seasoned gamblers know that it is hugely important to stay sober.
If you go into the mountains or drive over mountain passes, you should take into account that there may be snow or ice and that the temperature can be extremely low.
On icy and snow-covered roads, there is little friction, and as a result, it drives differently than on asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to cause problems.
Visibility can also be impaired by falling or blowing snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries and do not hinder traffic here.
The biggest tourist attraction in Africa is safaris, which for many visitors are the highlight of their trip.
The term safari refers in popular usage to travel over land to view the magnificent African wildlife, particularly on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars, and standard equipment makes for a good view.
If you want to see lions, cheetahs and leopards, you need a pair of binoculars. Otherwise, the chances of seeing them are slim.
A walking safari (also called a 'forest walk' or 'loopsafari') involves walking for several hours or days in a row.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Olympic Games twice, the first time being in 1964.
If you have already booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies are no longer valid until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000. Normal tickets will cost around ¥7,000.
You can dry damp clothes by ironing them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available. You can often borrow these items, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is not available or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can also use a hairdryer if available.
Make sure the fabric does not get too hot (this can cause the fabric to shrink or, in extreme cases, burn).
You can purify water in different ways. Some methods are effective against specific risks.
In some areas, it is sufficient to boil water for a minute, in other areas, water must be boiled for several minutes.
Not every filter is equally effective, so in case of doubt, it is best to drink water from a sealed bottle from a reliable company.
Travellers may encounter animal pests that do not exist in their own country.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Normally, infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that injure or kill people with violence, are not considered pests.
Tax-free shopping means that you can buy goods that are exempt from tax and excise duty in certain locations.
Travellers going to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money when it comes to products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
Point Marion and Fairmont are connected by the Buffalo to Pittsburgh highway, you often drive through abandoned hinterland, which makes this route a real challenge.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your head on straight. You will encounter many steep hills, narrow streets and sharp bends.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and adjacent areas — usually around 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h — and it's even more important to adhere to them here than elsewhere.
Surprisingly, you have a lot more coverage here than in other corners of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries taste great and in Bavaria the pastries are quite rich and varied, just like those of our southern neighbour, Austria.
You can see a lot of fruit pastries. Throughout the year, the pastries contain apples, and in the summer months, they also contain cherries and plums.
Many popular German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts, and go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a few small but mighty pastries, try some that are called in the region Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
To make a curry, you need spicy and pungent ingredients, combined with vegetables or meat.
Depending on the amount of liquid, a curry can be 'dry' or 'wet'.
In the interior of North India and also in Pakistan, yoghurt is often used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used instead.
The Indonesian cuisine includes dishes from 17,000 islands and is an umbrella term for a variety of regional cuisines from all over the country.
But without additional information, the term refers to the food that originally came from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine is now available throughout the archipelago and offers various simple spiced dishes. The most common Javanese flavourings are nuts, peppers, sugar (mainly Javanese coconut sugar) and various fragrant herbs.
Stirrups support the rider's feet and hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with more stability, but can also pose safety issues because a rider's feet can get trapped in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but gets caught by the stirrup, they can be dragged along with the horse. To reduce the risk, a number of safety measures have been put in place.
Most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars. This means that a saddle's stirrup can come loose if it is pulled backwards when a rider falls off a horse.
Cochamó Valley - This is the most popular climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, and has many different large granite walls and rocks.
The mountain peaks offer breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes on the rock faces, which seem to have endless potential.
Winter sports that involve going downhill, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular. You slide down a snow-covered slope with skis or a snowboard on your feet.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, who are sometimes referred to as 'ski bums', who plan entire holidays around skiing at a particular location.
Skiing has been around for a very long time: there are cave paintings of skiers dating back to 5000 BC!
The beginnings of skiing date back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski resort in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Backpacking with skis: this activity is also known as off-piste skiing, skitouring or ski hiking.
It's not exactly the same, but it's similar to alpine skiing or mountain climbing, which is a lot of what is done on steep terrain. Here you need much sturdier skis and boots.
You can see the ski route as a hiking route.
In good conditions, you can cover greater distances than when walking, but it is rare that you can reach the speed of cross-country skiing on prepared slopes without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, travelers have to apply for visas and undergo passport checks multiple times when moving between different countries.
The Schengen area functions almost like one country in this regard.
As long as you stay within this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to undergo passport control again.
If you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately for each Schengen country, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that indicates which produced items are antique. Some tax offices give the definition of antique to goods that are older than 100 years.
The definition can differ per location. In North America, for example, the age limit is lower than in Europe.
It is possible to label handmade products as antiques, even if they are newer than similar mass-produced items.
Among the Sámi, reindeer herding is an important form of livelihood. The culture surrounding the trade is also very important for many with other professions.
However, even traditionally not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry. They made a living from fishing, hunting and suchlike, and reindeer were usually used as draft animals.
Many Sámi work in modern professions today. In Sápmi, the Sámi area, tourism is an important source of income.
The word 'gypsy' is mainly used by non-Roma, but it is also often considered offensive because of the associations with negative stereotypes and incorrect perceptions of the Roma.
If there is a travel advisory for the country you want to travel to, this may have consequences for your travel health insurance or cancellation insurance.
In addition to the advice of your own government, you can also consult the advice of other governments, but their advice is aimed at their own residents.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may be faced with different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Opinions only include a brief summary of the political situation in a single country.
They often provide a fleeting, general and extremely simplistic image compared to other, more detailed sources.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world. There are different types of weather conditions, which vary based on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
The effects and consequences of severe weather include, for example, strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall and forest fires, but also thunderstorms, tornadoes, flash floods and hurricanes.
Snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms are just a few examples of regional and seasonal extreme weather phenomena.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks that severe weather conditions in their area may bring, as these may also affect some travel plans.
Anyone who wants to visit a country that is considered a war zone should be professionally trained.
A search on the internet for 'course in hostile environments' is likely to yield the address of a local company.
In a course, all the issues outlined here are normally covered in more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course normally lasts 2 to 5 days and consists of role-playing, a lot of first aid and occasional weapons training.
There are many books and magazines with articles about survival in the wilderness, but there are very few publications about war zones.
Travellers who have planned a gender-affirming surgery abroad should ensure they have the correct documentation for their return journey.
It varies widely whether governments want to provide passports without a gender (X) or to update a name or gender on documents.
There is just as much difference in the willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents.
Searches at security checks have also become much more extensive since September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery can expect to be subjected to this scan without their privacy and dignity being respected.
Muiren are the recurring surge of waves that break on a reef or similar feature and flow onto the beach.
Due to the submarine topography, the return flow is located in some deeper parts, where a fast current towards deep water can occur.
Most of the deaths are caused by exhaustion as people try to swim against the current, which could be impossible.
When you have escaped from the strong current, swimming back is a piece of cake.
Try to focus on a place where you won't be caught again. Depending on your skills and whether you have been noticed, you can also wait for help.
The shock of returning is worse than the culture shock (you have a lesser 'honeymoon feeling'), it lasts longer, and it can be more intense.
Travelers who easily adapt to new cultures sometimes have trouble adapting to their own culture again.
If you have lived abroad and then returned, you have adapted to the new culture and in the process lost some of the habits of your own culture.
In the past, when you went abroad, you noticed that people were patient and understanding. They understood that travelers had to adapt to a new country.
Usually, patience and understanding are not expected for travellers returning home.
For children, the pyramid show with light and sound is one of the most interesting activities in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Often, the sound of vendors and tourists is always audible here. The story of the light and sound is like that of a book.
The Sphinx forms the background and is the narrator of a long story.
The scenes appear as a projection on the pyramids and the rest of the pyramids are highlighted.
The South Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819 and have since been claimed by various countries. They have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others are Livingston Island, and Deception. Here you will find the overflowing crater of an active volcano that serves as a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth is located on the southern side of the peninsula, near the border with the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula give way to the plateau, after which they reappear to form the 360 km long Mount Ellsworth mountain range, which is crossed by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, also known as the Sentinel Range, includes the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif. Mount Vinson is the highest mountain at 4892 meters.
A satellite phone may be your only option in remote locations where there is no mobile phone reception.
A satellite phone is not really a replacement for a mobile phone, as you have to be outside in an open area with a clear view of the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is often used by the shipping industry, including pleasure craft, and for expeditions where external data and communication are required.
Your local phone provider can give you more information on how to connect to this service.
It is becoming increasingly popular for people planning a gap year to travel and learn.
Graduates in particular make use of this to take a gap year before university without it having any negative consequences for their education.
Often, enrolling in a course abroad during a gap year can increase your chances of returning to higher education in your own country.
Normally, tuition fees must be paid for enrollment in these educational programs.
Finland is a fantastic destination for boating. The 'Land of a Thousand Lakes' also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the archipelagos off the coast.
A yacht is not necessarily needed for the archipels or lakes.
The archipelagos on the coast and the largest lakes are indeed big enough for any yacht, but with smaller boats or even a kayak you get a completely different experience.
In Finland, so many people sail in their free time that the ratio of boats to people is one to seven or eight.
The figure is equal to the figure for Norway, Sweden and New Zealand. Furthermore, it is quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises include a long stay in St. Petersburg (Russia).
This way, you can spend a few full days in the historic town and spend the night on the ship.
Since 2009, you do not need a separate visa if you only go ashore during a boat excursion.
Some cruises include a visit to the German capital Berlin, but as you can see on the map, Berlin is not close to the sea. A visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be scary for people of all backgrounds and ages, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from many fears that other people also have.
Knowing how planes work can help to alleviate a fear that comes from the unknown or from not having control over the plane.
Courier companies are paid handsomely to deliver items quickly. For business documents, goods or spare parts for a necessary repair, time often plays a very important role.
Larger companies could use their own planes for certain routes, but for other routes it was more difficult for smaller companies.
If they ship things by air, it can take days on some routes for them to be unloaded and cleared by customs.
Only checked baggage could be processed more quickly. According to the rules of airlines, there must be a corresponding passenger, and that is you.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay for this privilege (or, even better, have your employer pay for it).
However, this is not cheap: the rule of thumb is that you pay about four times the price of economy class for business, and about eleven times for first class.
It usually makes no sense to look for discounts for business class or first class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know all too well that there is a group of flyers who are willing to pay a lot of money to fly somewhere quickly and comfortably, and the airlines charge appropriate fees for this.
Chişinău is the capital of Moldova. The Romanian language is mainly spoken here, but the Russian language is also very common.
As a multi-ethnic republic, Moldova was plagued by an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria in the east of Moldova. This republic has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by members of the UN.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in Moldova.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the largest port after Istanbul and a major transport hub.
The once ancient city of İzmir is now a modern, developed and busy commercial center on a bay and is surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, the glass buildings and the modern shopping centres covered in red tiles, the 18th-century markets, the old mosques and churches, but still the city feels more like a Mediterranean, European city than traditionally Turkish.
In the village of Haldarsvík you can enjoy views of the nearby island of Eysturoy, as well as a special church with eight corners.
There are some fascinating marble pigeon sculptures on a number of graves near the church.
If you have half an hour to spare, you should definitely take a look around this village.
In the north you will find the easily accessible, romantic and fascinating place of Sintra. Sintra became famous among foreigners after Lord Byron spoke highly of the beautiful monuments there.
The Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also head north to see the stunning Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (a temple complex), where internationally renowned Marian apparitions took place.
Remember that you are actually just visiting a mass grave, but also a place that has an almost immeasurable significance for a large part of the world population.
Many men and women who survived their time here are still alive, and many of them have loved ones who were murdered or worked to death there, both Jewish and non-Jewish.
Show all appropriate respect, solemnity, and dignity during your visit. Do not trivialise the Holocaust or Nazism.
Do not damage the site by applying markings or graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer Catalan, the vast majority can understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most signs are in Catalan, as that is the first official language according to the law.
Spanish is frequently spoken in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but unscheduled interruptions are made by an automated system in several languages, including French, Arabic, Spanish, English and even Japanese.
The inhabitants of Paris are known to be selfish, rude and arrogant.
Although this is usually just an incorrect stereotype, it can't hurt to put your best foot forward in Paris and act like someone who is 'bien élevé' (well-mannered). This will make it a lot easier to explore Paris.
The tough exterior of Parisians quickly disappears when you show that you are familiar with their way of doing things.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested and this forested area consists mainly of beech, spruce and pine trees, and includes a combination of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
There are a great many different plant communities, due to the different microclimates, different types of soil and varying differences in altitude.
This area is also the habitat of a very wide range of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat and the capercaillie can be found here, in addition to all kinds of more common species.
When women visit a monastery, they are required to wear a skirt that reaches above the knee and their shoulders must be covered.
Usually, you will be given a shawl as a woman if you arrive unprepared at a monastery, but if you bring your own, with nice bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you kindly.
On the other hand, men must wear pants that reach at least above the knee.
You can also borrow these from the stock at the entrance, but this clothing is not washed after each use, so you might not feel comfortable with that. One size fits all for men!
Like many other Mediterranean regions, the cuisine of Majorca is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and olive oil is widely used.
A simple and popular dish for dinner, mainly during the summer months, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and whatever flavourings are available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Independent nouns, just like Sie what you mean, always have a capital letter at the beginning, even if they are in the middle of a sentence.
This is how you make a significant distinction between a number of verbs and objects.
It probably also makes reading easier. However, writing is more complicated, because you have to figure out whether a verb or an adjective should be used as a noun.
Most Italian words are written exactly as they are pronounced, so pronunciation generally poses few problems.
You should pay the most attention to the c and the g. The pronunciation of these letters depends on the vowel that follows them.
You also have to pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means sweetheart, while carro means car.
The Persian language has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Reading this introduction to the grammar will teach you a lot about the grammar of Persian and help you understand sentences.
It is quite logical that if you know a Romance language, it is easier for you to learn Portuguese.
But people who speak a bit of Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is so similar that you don't need to learn it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are now outdated and serve as museums or educational attractions.
Light pollution was not such a big problem back then as it is now, so they were often built in cities or on campuses, more accessible than those of today.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities built in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami is the act of admiring cherry blossoms and has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
In China, plum blossoms were the favorite flowers and that is where the concept came from.
The first cherry blossom festivals in Japan were organized by the emperor and were intended only for himself and other aristocrats at the imperial court.
Plants look best in a natural environment, which should suppress the urge to remove even 'just one' species.
If you collect samples during a visit to a landscaped garden, you will be denied access to the garden immediately and without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to stay, very easy to navigate and almost everything is available upon arrival.
But if you are in the 'high tropics', just a few degrees north of the equator, you experience both heat (always) and strong sun (when the air is clear, which happens less often).
There are also a few buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Isaac, Jacob, Abraham and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you take actually goes to Hebron and doesn't just drive to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great holiday destination.
For example, you can visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, book a cruise to the interesting cities along the Danube or take a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also provide popular walking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
In addition, people who do not believe in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world have adopted many traditions associated with the holiday.
There is a tradition where you stay up all of Easter night until you can see the sunrise at some point.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could just as well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
In traditional churches, a Easter Vigil is often held on the Saturday evening of the Easter weekend, during which the congregations often celebrate a feast in honor of the resurrection of Christ at midnight.
All animals that originally arrived at the islands did so by swimming, flying or drifting.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, it was not possible for mammals to make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the most common grazing mammal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans set foot on the Galapagos, all kinds of mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
During the winter, polar night occurs in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, which means that the sun does not actually rise.
There is a good chance that you will be able to see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be dark most of the day and night.
The areas are sparsely populated and therefore light pollution is not often a problem, which means you can also enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese work environment is more structured and formal than in the Western world.
Workers wear standard uniforms and colleagues refer to each other by their last name or job title.
Unity in the workplace is of crucial importance. The focus is on group performance rather than on rewarding individual work performance.
Employees often need permission from their supervisors before they can make a decision, and they are expected to follow the instructions of their supervisors without question.
