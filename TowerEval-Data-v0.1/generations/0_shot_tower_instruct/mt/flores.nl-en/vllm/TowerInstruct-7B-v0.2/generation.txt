One experimental vaccine appears to be able to reduce Ebola deaths, but so far no drugs have been clearly shown to work for treating existing infections.
A cocktail of antibodies, ZMapp, was initially promising in the field, but official trials showed it had less benefit than hoped in preventing people dying.

The United States Olympic Committee has the support of USA Gymnastics and understands the need for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that it is in the best interest of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, to make meaningful changes to our organization rather than to take certifications.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that can shed more light on how abuse on this scale, so bravely described by the victims of Larry Nassar, could go undetected for so long, and embraces any necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the same goal: to ensure that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and empowering environment by making gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible.

This not only proves the already widespread theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional placement.
According to scientists, the bird's plumage was chestnut brown with a pale or carotenoid-coloured underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
The researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development, because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, or rachis, but do have other features of feathers - such as barbules.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but for temperature regulation or for display. The researchers suggested that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, but this monster shows adult feathers and is not a chick's down.
The researchers suggested that, despite being the tail of a young dinosaur, the monster had the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chick.

The completed work was primarily theoretical in nature, but the program was written for the purpose of simulating observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The team was looking for the effect that would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the universe and that of the Milky Way.
Similar to how the moon exerts a force on the Earth, leading to tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The researchers concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that it affects ordinary matter.
According to this theory, the majority of dark matter in a galaxy is located around it, in a kind of ring, and consists of a large number of smaller particles.

"The thermal behavior of these is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a temperature that is quite constant," said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally required little technology: voters go into a booth and put a pre-printed piece of paper into an envelope that says which candidate they are voting for.
Officials first check the identity of the voter, then the voter slides the envelope into the ballot box and then signs the voting roll.
The process is relatively well defined in the electoral law of France.
Ballot boxes have been required to be transparent since 1988, so that both voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the start of the vote and that no other envelopes are added than those of registered and authorised voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process, and volunteers count the votes under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar are the suspects.
According to police commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the suspects covered their faces when they appeared in court.
There were three people in the house when the car hit the house, but none of them were injured.
The driver did, however, suffer serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services tried to free the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially taken to Great Yarmouth's James Paget Hospital.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been convicted in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court of murdering her son.
She is in custody awaiting charges and trial, but the eyewitness account may have been coached because her story has been published widely.
This is standard practice in the rest of the UK, but justice in Scotland works differently and courts have deemed the publication of photos as possibly detrimental.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that 'journalists are playing a dangerous game when they publish photos etc of suspects.'
The Crown Office is in overall charge of prosecutions and has told journalists that no further statements will be made, at least until charges are laid.
According to sources, the document refers to a dispute settlement, something that the Palestinians have been keen to have based on the borders before the Middle East war in 1967.
Other topics discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, a city holy to both peoples, and the problems in the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands that a permanent military presence be maintained in the valley for ten years after the signing of an agreement, but the PA is only willing to accept a presence for five years.
Archers in the supplementary trial for pest control had to be closely monitored by forest rangers. The trial was followed and its effectiveness was assessed.
In a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park conservation and heritage at the NPWS, the four chosen marksmen for the first shooting operation have had extensive safety and training instructions.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a nine-member new provisional electoral council (Provisional Electoral Council of CEP).
Martelly has achieved a CEP five times in the past four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous National Electoral Council, as part of a package of measures to bring new elections to the country.
The commission was established by Martelly in response to widespread protests against the government that have taken place since October.
The sometimes violent protests arose from the failure to hold elections, some of which were due to take place as far back as 2011.
Around 60 cases have been reported of iPods overheating and catching fire, resulting in six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of the 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company called "not serious."
‘Very regrettable’, was the reaction of the ministry to the fact that Apple has delayed the report.
Mariana was hit by the earthquake at 07.19 local time (Friday 21.19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said no damage had been reported across the territory.
In addition, the National Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no tsunami warning.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former policeman from the Philippines has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been brought to safety and so far at least six fatalities have been confirmed.
Six hostages were earlier released, including children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers returned in exchange for an elderly woman who needed to use the bathroom, and Mendoza was eventually shot.
Liggins went into medicine, following in his father's footsteps.
Educated as a midwife, he started working in 1959 at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins conducted research on premature birth in his free time.
His research showed that the maturation of the foetal lungs of babies was speeded up by the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black boxes" with flight recorders on Wednesday.
Co-wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, 'Luna was the first 'Queen of Extreme'. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons. As unique as she was. A strong woman.'
Dustin 'Goldust' Runnels said 'Luna was as weird as me... maybe even weirder... I love her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place'.
Of the 1,400 people surveyed for the 2010 federal election, the number who opposed Australia becoming a republic rose by 8 per cent since 2008.
Outgoing Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four per cent of those surveyed backed the move, saying they wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
Twenty-nine per cent of respondents thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent said it should never happen.
The Olympic gold medallist swam the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games but his fitness was called into question because of his complaints.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to ease his pain because it's banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a math and computer science professor at Central Missouri University, discovered the currently largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery in early February using different hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source of water to Earth, along with organic material that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to gain insight into how planets are formed, and in particular, they want to know how the Earth was formed, given that it has been a very long time since comets collided with the Earth.
Cuomo, 53, was sworn in as governor earlier this year and signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumours 'political nonsense and gossip'.
It is speculated that he wants to run for president in 2016.
The NextGen system would allow planes to take shorter routes, the FAA says, potentially saving millions of tons of fuel and reducing carbon emissions each year.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older ground radar-based technologies, which allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft much more accurately and provide pilots with clearer information.
No additional transport will be deployed and no surface trains will stop at Wembley; in addition, the parking lots and the P&R are not accessible on the site.
A possible lack of transport meant that the chances of the match being played behind closed doors and without supporters increased.
A study published in the scientific journal Science on Tuesday was about the formation of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved within two generations. It was thought that this process took much longer because the crossing of a native Darwin finch, the Median ground finch, with an immigrated Cactus ground finch, the Española ground finch, took longer.
Gold can be processed into many shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into a narrow wire that can be twisted and braided. It can also be forged or rolled into plates.
Once made very thin, it could be pasted onto another metal. It could even be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books known as 'illuminated manuscripts'.
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can already make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of the cabbage juice then changes based on the acidity (acid to basic or alkaline) of the chemical.
The pH value is given by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron, and hydrogen ions are protons without electrons.
Mix both dry powders together, make your hands wet and clean and make a ball.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjodaro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to an advanced sewage system.
Sewage remains have been found in houses in Minoan cities on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
Furthermore, there were already toilets in China, Egypt and Persia in ancient times. For example, in the Roman era, toilets were often part of a public bathhouse, where both men and women gathered in a mixed group.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
As soon as the space satellite receives the call, it is immediately sent back.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and image.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, you need a huge rocket that is more than 30 metres long.
The wheel has changed the world incredibly. The most important thing that the wheel has given us is easier and faster transport.
The train, the car and many other means of transport are the result of this.
There are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from hares to antelopes and deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (such as feral cats kept as pets) that hunt in larger numbers on small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
Their success comes from the idea of a niche, a special job that every cat has, so they don't compete with others.
Lions are the most social of cats and live in large groups called prides.
Troops consist of one to three adult males that are related to each other and also have up to thirty females and cubs.
The women are normally closely related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions behaves much like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that look surprisingly like lions (but not other big cats) and that are very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (although not well), swim, jump long distances and has five times the pulling power of a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger does not roar as loudly as a lion. It is more like a whole sentence growled.
Ocelots' favourite meal is small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Ocelots hunt almost exclusively on animals that are much smaller than they are.
Scholars suspect that ocelots use their sense of smell to hunt small animals (their prey) by smelling the ground where they have been.
They have excellent night vision and move very quietly. Ocelots hunt prey by blending into their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the larger population it came from (for example, by moving over a mountain range or river, or being moved to another island, from which it may not be able to return easily), they are often in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, other resources and other enemies are present, so the new population must change its approach or adapt to be able to compete.
Because they still need the same adaptations as before, the original population has not changed at all.
As the new population began to adapt to the new environment, they also began to look less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that you can no longer call them the same species.
This process is called speciation and simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe in and absorb carbon dioxide that people exhale.
Through photosynthesis, the plants absorb their nutrients from the sun, and they also provide shade.
Our houses and clothes are made of plants. We eat mostly plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain of that time. It had nothing to fear from anyone, except from other Mosasauruses.
His long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an extra set in the palate, meaning nothing or no one could escape him.
It is not certain, but it is possible that his tongue was forked. It ate turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and perhaps even its own kind.
Nothing was safe from his attacks in the water either; even giant dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex were no match for him.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans also had their fair share of exotic or unusual delicacies, including wild boar, peacocks, snails and a kind of rodent called a dormouse.
There was also a difference; poor people and women sat on chairs while eating, but rich men liked to have a banquet together where they lay on their sides while eating.
Meals from Roman times do not contain food that came from America or Asia to Europe in later centuries.
For example, they did not have maize, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa. Moreover, not a single ancient Roman ever ate a turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods. This temple was considered the god's own home.
Offerings were made to the gods and the priests tried to satisfy the needs of the gods by organizing ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had a public courtyard and a back room that was only accessible to priests.
Sometimes, as part of the temples, towers in the shape of pyramids were built, called ziggoerattes.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
Houses were not of great importance in the hot climate of the Middle East.
The daily life of the Hebrew family took place mostly outside.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were no more than a counter along the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, and so wood was very expensive.
Greenland had few inhabitants. According to Norwegian sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, found Greenland on his way west, and gave it its name.
He made this discovery, but there were already Eskimo tribes living there at that time.
Although all were 'Scandinavian' countries, the people, the royal family, customs and history of Sweden, Iceland, Denmark and Norway were very different from each other.
After the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That is a misconception, however. There is indeed something written on the back, but it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence reads "Original Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776." The text is upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one is sure who wrote it, it is certain that the large parchment (29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was once rolled up for storage.
It seems that the designation was simply added as a kind of label.
Thanks to the D-Day landings and the subsequent fighting, northern France was liberated. However, the south remained occupied.
It was ruled by Vichy France, which was made up of French people who, in 1940, sided with the Germans and so collaborated with the enemy instead of fighting against them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France with Operation Dragoon.
The Americans and the Free French had liberated southern France in just two weeks. After that, they set off for Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together in a society.
The term civilisation comes from the Latin civilis, which means civilian, and is related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state; and this also defines the format of society in a certain way.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilization with a culture suggests that knowledge is passed down over multiple generations, leaving a lasting cultural footprint and balanced distribution.
When minority cultures disappear, they often leave no relevant historical evidence behind, and so they are not officially recognized as civilizations.
During the revolution, thirteen states under the Articles of Confederation formed a weak central government consisting only of a congress.
The convention lacked the power to levy taxes because there was no national executive or judiciary, and relied on state authorities to implement all decisions, which often were unwilling to cooperate.
Nor did it have the power to ignore tax laws and rates between states.
All states had to agree unanimously on the articles before they could be amended, but the states did not take the national government so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, after the German team, and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are especially popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan consists of almost 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu). This makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
Due to the cluster/group of islands Japan possesses, Japan is often referred to geographically as a "peninsula"
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century, when sailors from Europe sailed past the island and gave it the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch VOC established itself in southwestern Taiwan as a base, where the VOC tackled the indigenous grain production processes and put Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan were conquered by troops of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912), after which Taiwan was annexed in 1885 as a province of the Qing Empire.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, which transferred sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Built from three large structures, Machu Picchu consists of Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room with Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like before.
In 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration is still ongoing.
For example, the most common photo format for still images worldwide is 35 mm, which was the usual film format at the end of the analogue film era.
These are still produced today, although it is mainly the image ratio that the image sensor of the digital camera has taken over.
Oddly enough, 35 mm film is actually 36 mm wide, with a height of 24 mm.
The aspect ratio of this size (divide by twelve to get the simplest ratio of integers) would be 3:2 in this case.
Many common aspect ratios (e.g., APS-C ratios) are equal to or a close approximation of this aspect ratio.
The third-party rule, which is often abused and ridiculed by many, is a simple guideline that makes the image dynamic, yet also clear.
The most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines. This divides the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in the history of Europe, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was under fire.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united European states, despite differences in language and customs.
From the king to the common citizen, his all-pervasive power affected everyone.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to combat suffering and poverty, and the church has resources for this reason.
The church had been the central authority in Rome for over a thousand years and this relationship of power and money led many people to question whether this principle was being adhered to.
Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany shortly after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy proved effective, as it was no longer possible to deliver vital supplies to the military and civilians, but this blockade violated the generally accepted international law that has been established over the past two centuries in various international agreements.
Great Britain has placed mines in international waters, so that ships could no longer sail in large parts of the ocean, which was dangerous even for neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to the country's unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations had a pacifist and isolationist attitude.
After the First World War, states wanted to prevent such horrors from ever happening again.
Tesla emigrated to the United States in 1884 to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
When he came to the United States, he had only 4 cents, a collection of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each phase of China or each ruling family had a distinct dynasty.
There was also an unstable period between the different dynasties, during which the provinces were divided. The most famous of these was the Three Kingdoms period, which took place in the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
At that time, there were heavy wars between different nobles who fought for the throne.
The era of the Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the fight for the highest position in the great palace in Xi'an.
The Revolution had major social and political consequences, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolute monarchy to republicanism, nationalism and the idea that the land belongs to its inhabitants rather than a single leader.
For all male applicants, positions were available after the revolution, so that the most ambitious and suitable candidates could succeed.
The same goes for the army. Army ranks are no longer based on one's class, but on the caliber of the person.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working class in other countries to revolt.
Muhammad was deeply involved in matters of the spirit, and often went to a cave for contemplation, which later became known as the Cave of Hira in the Mountains of Noor.
The cave itself, which has withstood the test of time, gives a very vivid picture of the spirituality of Mohammed.
The cave is located on one of the mountain peaks on the north side of Mecca and is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
Even if it was known that the cave existed, it was not easy to find at all. Once inside the cave, there is total isolation.
All you can see is the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. From the cave, there is very little of this world to see or hear.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still stands.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC and is one of the many large pyramid structures in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or 'Giza pyramids' in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings contains several pyramids (with the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, a number of temples and the great Sphinx.
The large pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, while many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built as tributes to Khufu's wives and family members.
The up-bow sign looks like a V and the down-bow sign looks like a dot or a square with the bottom missing.
Above means you should start at the dot and push the rod away. Below means you should start at the bow frog (the place where your hand holds the rod) and pull the rod.
An upward stroke usually produces a softer sound, while a downward stroke produces a stronger, more assertive sound.
Take the liberty to sketch your personal marks, but don't forget that the printed rests are there for a musical reason, so they usually have to be respected.
A group of market women sat on October 6, 1789, behind the departure of the terrified Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Therese of 11 and Louis-Charles of 4), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, from Versailles to Paris.
They travelled back to the French capital in a carriage, surrounded by jeering and threatening mobs who threatened the royal couple.
The actions of the crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At one point, someone in the crowd held up the head of a royal guard who had been murdered at Versailles in front of the eyes of a terrified queen.
The war costs of the U.S. imperialism in relation to the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the people of the Philippines.
They were imposed on the American colonial regime to pay taxes to finance a large part of the costs and the interest on bonds was issued through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government.
American imperialism rested in large part on the enormous profits of the long-term exploitation of the Philippines.
To understand the Templars, one must know the context that gave rise to the order.
The era in which this happened is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the history of Europe in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
After the early Middle Ages came the high Middle Ages, which were followed by the late Middle Ages, which usually ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term for a broad range of ideas in practice: from technology offerings or technological imperative to a strict sense that human fate is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and the appearance of them in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism hold these two general views: the development of technology follows a trajectory that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, some will say that the arrival of the car automatically leads to the construction of roads.
A national road network is economically unfeasible for just a few cars, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The mass car ownership also leads to more accidents on the road and this leads to the development of new healthcare techniques to repair the human body.
Romanticism included a large component of cultural determinism, which came from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In Romanticism, geography shaped the individual, and over time, customs and cultures emerged from this geography, forming a harmonious society that was better than arbitrary laws imposed from above.
Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe, just as Paris is the current fashion capital.
It was known as a centre of luxury from around 400 AD to around 1100 AD.
The status of the empire declined in the 12th century, mainly because the crusaders returned with silk and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
Around this time, Paris also took over the title of fashion capital from Constantinople.
Gothic architecture was at its peak in the 10th, 11th and 14th centuries.
Clothing was initially strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture from the east.
However, due to the slow communication channels, styles in the west were 25 to 30 years behind.
At the end of the Middle Ages, a style of its own began to develop in Western Europe. One of the biggest developments was the result of the Crusades: people started using knots to fasten their clothing.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture where enough food is produced to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system that is usually organic, using saved seed from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers worked in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by societal norms, giving them the opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender of their members.
A subculture can be defined by the following types of qualities: linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic or one or more of these factors together.
Members of a subculture often show which group they belong to through a certain symbolic style in what they wear, how they behave and the jargon they speak.
One of the most commonly used methods of illustrating the importance of civilization was the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, adversity or wilful abuse, did not become socialized by adults during their upbringing.
They are called 'wolf children' or 'feral children'. Some of these children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); sometimes the child was abandoned because the parents did not want to accept the serious mental or physical disability of the child.
Troublesome children may have experienced severe child abuse or serious trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived in the wild alone.
A feral child who has not been raised by humans may exhibit behavior that resembles the behavior of the animal that raised the child (within physical limits), such as fear of or indifference to humans.
Learning by project should simplify education and make it more interesting, but scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of teaching but a tool to support individuals who are facing a new learning experience, for example, a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real. A teacher is one form of support, but the paperclip in Microsoft Office is another.
There is virtual scaffolding built into the software that asks questions, provides memory cues and explains procedures that might be difficult for students to understand without help.
There are various reasons why children end up in foster care, such as neglect, abuse and exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are not well cared for, where they are not loved and where they cannot develop, but this is happening.
We consider the foster care system to be a safe zone for these children.
The aim of foster care is to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care must meet all the needs that were neglected in the previous home.
On the internet, elements of interpersonal and mass communication are combined.
The different characters of the internet lead to new dimensions in the application of the uses & gratifications theory.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialisation' are presented as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) introduced new motivational aspects such as 'personal involvement' and 'ongoing relationships' when they examined audience responses to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to remarkable findings in interpreting micro-expressions, which are facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is stated that no one can recognize a lie by paying attention only to micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks described in his essay The President's Speech how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can nevertheless accurately judge its sincerity.
He even suggested that other species, such as domestic dogs, also have the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variants: hidden and visible.
By mutation, new genetic variation is added; by selection, this variation is eliminated from the pool of expressed variation.
For each generation, there is variation between the two groups by means of separation and recombination.
A primate with a digestive system similar to humans can survive in the savannah, but it is difficult for them to obtain the necessary amino acids from the plant sources available there.
Failure to observe this can have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The easiest plant sources to find are the proteins in leaves and legumes, but unless they are cooked, they are difficult for primates like us to digest.
Not only is animal food (ants, termites, eggs) easily digestible, but it also contains a lot of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
All in all, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their 'protein problem' in the same way that chimpanzees in the savannah solve this problem today.
Sleep disruption means that you wake up for a reason during your normal sleep period and fall back to sleep within a short time (10–60 minutes).
This is quite easy by using a relatively soft alarm that brings you back to consciousness without immediately waking you up completely.
If you want to wear your watch while sleeping, you can place it on the other side of the room. This way, you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on the biorhythm are, for example, drinking a lot of liquid before going to bed (and then especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic). This means you will have to get up to pee.
The amount of inner calm a person possesses is in contrast to the amount of stress that a person carries in his or her body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive the life force present. Every human being is capable of achieving contentment and total peace.
Everyone can enlighten their mind. Only your own stress and negativity stand in the way of this goal.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but this form of Buddhism has been expanded with the Mahayana path of love and with a large number of techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism consists of a relatively simple core of kundalini yoga, meditation, and following universal love.
Through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualized images, the energy of Kundalini yoga (enlightenment energy) is awakened.
The core of Tibetan meditation is yoga with a deity as the focus. Using the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated, and consciousness is brought into an enlightened state.
Because Germany was a common enemy in World War II, cooperation between the USSR and the USA was established. After the war, conflicts between system, process and culture caused the countries to fall out with each other.
The former allies were on opposite sides two years after the end of the war, this was the beginning of the Cold War.
The war would last 40 years and saw proxy armies fighting on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
The Polish defenders held out until 17 September 1939, when they had to retreat and reorganize along the bridgehead in Romania.
These plans were however undone in one night, when 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded and formed the Latvian and Ukrainian fronts, after occupying the eastern parts of Poland, in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other international peace treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Shipping is the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, the navy's job is to ensure that a country retains the ability to transport people and goods, while impeding the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
The US tried to get men and material across the Atlantic to the British, and this North Atlantic campaign of WWII is one of the most remarkable recent examples.
The German navy tried to stop this traffic at the same time, mainly with U-boats.
Like the rest of Europe, Britain would probably have fallen into German hands if the Allies had failed.
It seems that the goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Iranian Zagros Mountains.
In ancient times, cultures and tribes started to keep them so that they could always easily get their hair, meat, milk and hides.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds on a hill or other grazing area, guarded by a goat herder, often a child or young person, much like the more familiar sheep herder. Today, they are still guarded in the same way.
As early as the 16th century, horse-drawn railways were built in England.
Although horse-drawn railways were made of plank rails, the horses had to run faster and pull more than on the somewhat difficult roads of the time.
Cross-ties were used quite early to keep the rails in place, but gradually it was realised that rails would be more efficient if there was an iron point on the top.
This soon became the standard practice, but the iron resulted in more wear and tear on the wooden carriage wheels.
Iron wheels eventually replaced the wooden ones. In 1767, the first completely iron rails were laid.
The first form of transport we know is walking. People started walking upright two million years ago when Homo erectus came along (which means upright man).
Their predecessor, Australopithecus, walked upright less often.
Bipedal specializations are found in fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago. Sahelanthropus, moreover, may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly, join an environmental movement or even take action to mitigate future suffering.
In many cases, it is like treating the symptoms, but if we want more than a temporary solution, we need to identify the root cause of the problems and address them.
The scientific and technological development of human society has obviously changed the earth profoundly. Moreover, overpopulation and extravagant human lifestyle have aggravated the problems.
After the Declaration of Independence was adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent to printer John Dunlap a few blocks away. The draft was signed by the president of the Continental Congress, John Hancock, and clerk Charles Thomson.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, and are now better known as 'Dunlap broadsides'.
John Nixon first read the document publicly on July 8 in the garden of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6 and read to his troops in New York on July 9, while another arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of the document; the original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists believe that dinosaurs still exist today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them to be dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still make them seem like dinosaurs.
They have claws and scales on their feet, lay eggs and walk on their hind legs, just like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Manipulating data encoded in binary digits forms the basis for nearly all computers in use today.
A binary number can only have two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits (and in computer language 'bits').
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are so common that a diagnosis may not be made immediately.
The presence of open boxes of medication or toxic household chemicals is the best indication of internal poisoning.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
This group of insects is formally called ‘true bugs’ by entomologists.
This term comes from an ancient agreement with bed bugs, which are insects that can parasitize humans very well.
Both bed bugs and cockroaches are nesting insects, they have adapted to live in the nest or the house of their host.
In the US, there are around 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological condition in adults of both younger and middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or that of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to give up their baby for adoption.
In adoption, the parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
Figuring out how the world works through the scientific method is the primary goal of science. This method is the guiding principle for most scientific inquiry.
However, it is more than just an experiment; an experiment is a test to exclude one or more potential assumptions, to put question marks and to make observations, as a guide for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on science, including psychology, were accepted.
The West understood Greek philosophy and science less and less as knowledge of Greek declined.
In physiological and behavioral observations of rhythms, there is often a strong dependence on endogenous processes and the production via the biological clock.
Most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, live according to periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-contained oscillators that cycle through a particular time period, even if there are no external signals to cue them.
The experiment of Hershey and Chase was one of the most important indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were carried out, in one the DNA in the phage was labelled with radioactive phosphorus and in the other the protein of the phage was labelled with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type, the importance of the genetic material involved and whether the affected cells are reproductive cells.
Only mutations in germ cells are hereditary. Other mutations can cause cells to die or can cause cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who like to visit natural areas because they want to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
On site, visitors can hunt, fish, take photographs, observe birds, visit parks and study the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing and learning about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people from small villages drive to their workplace and pass people whose workplace is located in the village they just came from.
Everyone in this dynamic transport shuttle is in some way connected to and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science shows that this enormous carbon economy has taken the biosphere out of the stable state that allowed human evolution to occur over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems, and almost everyone complains about them.
In developed countries, problems with water quality or collapsing bridges are rarely seen.
How is it that so many complaints arise in transport systems, why does it go wrong on a daily basis? Are transport technicians simply incompetent or is it something more fundamental?
In traffic flow, the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between the individuals are examined.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to examine the traffic flow, because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave in a relatively predictable way. This means that traffic flows show a certain degree of consistency, and that there is something to be said about this in mathematical terms.
The three core characteristics have been linked to better represent traffic flow: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships facilitate the planning, design and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Thanks to their ability to fly, they could more easily escape from predators and find food and mates more efficiently.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along their body.
This allows them to hide from predators in a greater number of small places.
Currently, only dragonflies and mayflies cannot fold their wings.
A few thousand years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
There were people who thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system moved around the Earth, and the Sun, therefore, too (and other stars).
This sounds pretty logical, because you don't feel that the earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the world's largest and second-longest river and carries more than 8 times as much water as the next largest.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, and in some places it is six miles wide.
At least 20% of all the water that flows into the sea via the rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 mi) long. The water comes from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remain unsurpassed in size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monument of their predecessors, which was already more than a thousand years old.
There are approximately 800 inhabitants in Vatican City. This is the smallest independent country in the whole world and also the country with the lowest population.
Italian is the official language for communication and laws of Vatican City.
Italian is the language most spoken by the people who work there, while Latin is used a lot during religious ceremonies.
Everyone who lives in Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People have known the most basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver and copper, since ancient times, because they are all found in nature and it is relatively easy to extract them with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle speculated that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This seemed more like what we know of the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, but he also theorized that they transition into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are, in simple terms, a combination of at least two metals. As you probably know, the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are classified as metals. There are also metals such as silver and gold, of course.
Alloys may also contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, for example carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a trillion atoms would fit at the tip of the end of this sentence.
That is why the pencil was a faithful friend to many people when it was launched.
Unfortunately, the pen has been downgraded in status as newer writing methods have emerged and is used much less.
Nowadays, messages are written on a computer screen without ever needing a pencil sharpener.
You might wonder what will happen to the keyboard once something new comes onto the market.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it costs energy to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
As if you are pushing a heavy cart up a hill. When the nucleus is split again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means that they fall apart at the slightest provocation.
The surface of the moon is characterized by dust and rock. The crust is the outer layer of the moon.
The crust is about 70 km thick at its closest point and 100 km thick at its farthest point.
The crust is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more mares on the side, because the crust is thinner there, and lava could easily rise to the surface.
Content theories are aimed at discovering what moves people and what appeals to them.
This theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they grow up.
With these theories, they want to examine the reasons why certain people want certain things and which environmental factors influence them to do certain things or not.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Motivation-Hygiene Theory.
In general, there are two ways managers handle leading former colleagues: One is to try to be a peer.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions and take disciplinary action, conduct performance reviews, delegate and hold people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, this person transforms into an unrecognizable individual, feeling the need to change everything the team has done so far and wanting to take ownership of everything.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
Often, this behavior leads to a gap between leaders and team members.
Virtual teams must meet the same standards of excellence as face-to-face teams, although there are some differences.
In most cases, virtual team members are the first point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They are often more independent than traditional team members, because their teams can meet across different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The idea of a truly 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, pp 109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
The ‘invisible team’ is the management team to whom each member reports. The invisible team also sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organization want to start the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One of the goals for putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and resourcefulness come to light when all available resources within the functional departments of an organization are effectively deployed.
The result of this is that the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
To enable innovation in an organization, management must foster a culture that prioritizes innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
According to Angel (2006), organizations can perform better with an approach based on the continuum model.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to examining cognition, thereby allowing the field of research to be narrowed and more accurate data to be collected.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, wounds and tumours can affect behaviour and lead to changes in mental capacity.
As more and more new technologies are developed, we are learning more and more about the structures and processes in the brain.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to develop simulation models that give us more insight into the processes of our mind.
AI is what most people think of when they think of science fiction, but it is also an essential part of computer science. It is used in research into machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Developing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior falls under research into AI.
Examples include management, planning, the ability to diagnose and answer customer questions, and the recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
These have become separate disciplines for finding solutions to problems in real life.
Nowadays, this system of artificial intelligence is widely used in economic, medical, technical and military fields, such as in various software applications for PCs and video games.
Many field trips are planned for each class, and often a teacher would take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Thanks to technological advances, virtual excursions are now possible, allowing pupils to view artefacts in a museum, take a peek inside an aquarium or see beautiful works of art from the classroom.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital, which is redesigned each year, and earlier versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students to write better. Often their grammar and spelling is poor at first, but this changes quickly because they have an audience.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve the writing to avoid criticism.
By blogging, 'students are also forced to learn more about the world around them'. The need to keep the audience interested inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
When used well, blogs can help students develop analytical and critical thinking skills; by actively engaging in online discussion, students can find their place in the context of others' material and, at the same time, determine their own stance on certain issues' (Oravec, 2002).
The bilingual capital of Canada is the charming Ottawa, full of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and future.
Further south you will find the Niagara Falls. In the north you will find the beautiful unspoiled Muskoka and much more.
This kind of thing makes Ontario seem quintessentially Canadian to outsiders.
Further north, large areas are sparsely populated and some of these areas are even virtually uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that will surprise many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than the total population of Canada.
The East African islands are located along the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and in terms of fauna it is almost a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or are linked to France and are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought the Islamic faith with them, which then spread widely on the Comoros and Mayotte.
The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India, which marked the beginning of European influence and colonisation in the 15th century.
The region is bordered to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean and to the north by the Sahel.
Women: female travellers are advised to say they are married, whether or not this is true.
It also helps to put rings on (not too expensive looking rings).
Women should be aware that cultural differences may lead to behaviour that they perceive as intimidating, such as being followed, being grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be clear when you reject a man and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences don't speak well of this!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen. The city was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids and was known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the port and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca. After an earthquake in 1755, they left the city again.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and named it Daru l-Bayad. The Spanish traders who established their trading base here gave it the name Casablanca.
In Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
Around the old Medina you will find many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan items, such as tagines, pots, leather products, hookahs and other trinkets, but it is purely aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The city is located near Rwanda, in the far east.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed when the Nyiragongo volcano spewed lava, burying most of the city's streets, particularly the city center.
Although Goma itself is relatively safe, you should check the situation regarding the fighting in the province of North Kivu before visiting any places outside Goma.
In addition, the city is the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and you can find some of the most affordable trips for tracking Mountain Gorillas in Africa.
You can get around Goma by boda-boda (a motorcycle taxi). The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese Francs for the short ride.
'Timbuktu' is relatively poorly accessible and is therefore nowadays used as a metaphor for exotic, far-off countries.
Today Timbuktu is a dilapidated city, but its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites due to desert storms.
It was one of the main stops on the PBS exhibition, African American Lives with Henry Louis Gates.
The city is different from the other cities in the country, because it has a more Arabic feel than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs east along the border with Mozambique, north along the border with Zimbabwe and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park is 19,500 square kilometres in size, divided into 14 different eco-zones, where various wild animal species are kept.
As a major attraction in South Africa, this park is the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily conservation fees and entrance fees.
It can also be useful to buy a Wild Card, which offers access to certain parts of parks in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
The entire territory of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, which is considered by many tourists to be the most important place.
The skyline of Hong Kong, made up of a vast number of buildings, has already been compared to a glittering bar graph that is visible thanks to the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the waterfront of Kowloon across the way.
The vast majority of the island's population live very close to each other on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is where the British settlers established themselves, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forests in the world and stretch 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into the Indian and Bangladeshi interior.
The Sundarbans are now officially included on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part within the Indian borders is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are more than just mangrove swamps — they also contain some of the last great tracts of jungle that ever covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which a third is peat and marshland.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and the area is now estimated to be home to 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 axis deer.
During the day, buses leave from the district border station (opposite the river). Most leave between 6.30 and 7.30, especially to the east and to Jakar/Bumthang.
It is wise to buy a ticket a few days in advance, because the local buses are often fully booked.
In most neighborhoods, small Japanese Coaster buses drive, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis can take you quickly and comfortably to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that crosses the Oyapock River to connect the Brazilian city of Oiapoque and the French Guiana town of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock.
The two towers are 83 metres high. The building is 378 metres long and has two passages with a width of 3.50 metres.
The clearance height under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction of the bridge was completed in August 2011, but it only opened to traffic in March 2017.
According to the plan, the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, and the Brazilian customs posts are expected to be ready for use by then.
The Guarani were the most prominent indigenous group. They lived in what is now eastern Paraguay, lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
In the province of Chaco, other indigenous tribes lived, including the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who found their food by hunting, fishing and gathering.
Paraguay, also known as the "great province of India," emerged in the 16th century when Spanish colonizers encountered the indigenous population.
This was followed by a three-century period of colonisation by the Spanish.
Asunción was founded in 1537 and since then Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year takes place on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
Check the Asociación Argentina de Polo for more information about tournaments and buying tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is roughly equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
There is only one bank on the islands, in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store, where you can exchange money.
In general, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the remote islands, you probably can't pay with a credit card, but you can probably pay with British and American currency. Ask the owners in advance about how you can pay.
Exchange your money back before you leave the islands, because Falkland currency is very difficult to exchange outside.
Montevideo is below the equator, so when it is summer there, it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months, temperatures of over +30°C are not uncommon.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind, combined with humidity, makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
The rainfall level remains more or less constant throughout the year, without any recognisable ‘wet’ and ‘dry’ periods.
Many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, but wild animals are still wild at heart, so they should not be fed or disturbed.
Keep at least 100 metres away from bears and wolves, and 25 metres away from all other wild animals in the park.
Elk, bison, reindeer, bears and pretty much all other large animals can attack you, no matter how tame they seem.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year for not keeping proper distance. These animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly foods and keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia and the city with almost 40,000 inhabitants is located on the island of Upolu.
Founded around 1850, Apia has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, seven ships from Germany, the USA and Great Britain refused to leave the port. This was later known as the infamous standoff.
With the exception of a British battleship, all ships were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the Mau movement's fight for independence, the highest leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, died in a violent non-violent meeting in the city.
There are many beaches, particularly because of the two harbours of Auckland. The most popular are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore in the North Harbour district stretch from north to south along the Pacific Ocean, from Long Bay to Devonport.
These are almost all sandy beaches where it is safe to swim and most have pohutukawa trees providing shade.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located at Waitemata's harbour, in the luxury suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, located in Central Auckland.
These family beaches are sometimes crowded and have a good range of shops on the coast. Swimming is not unsafe.
‘Number One’ is the most important local beer, which is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called ‘Manta’.
There are plenty of French wines to be found, but New Zealand and Australian wines are perhaps better suited for travel.
The local drinking water can be safely drunk, but bottled water is also easy to find if you don't trust it.
A 'flat white' is a strange concept for Australians. Black coffee is 'espresso', cappuccino has a lot of coffee milk (without foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian quality. Fruit juices are expensive, but great.
Trips to the reef occur throughout the year and injuries from these trips to the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, seek expert advice and follow all signs and safety warnings.
Jellyfish occur from October to April near beaches and river mouths north of the Town of 1770, and sometimes outside this period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
The main habitat of saltwater crocodiles is in the river mouths north of Rockhampton and they do not normally live in the ocean.
Pre-booking provides peace of mind for the traveller, knowing that they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have deals with certain hotels, but you can usually also book other types of accommodation, such as a campsite, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast and transport to and from the airport, and sometimes even flights and hotel stays.
They can also hold your reservation if you need a little more time to think about the offer or if you need to obtain documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, if you have a request or want to make a change, you must do this through the travel agency rather than the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of attendees at music festivals choose to camp on site and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to be early to secure a campsite near the music.
And remember this: even when the music on the main stages has finished, there is still music being played on other parts of the festival grounds until late at night.
For families with young children, there are special camping areas at some festivals.
Be careful where you sit when crossing the Baltic in winter, because the ice churns up a lot of noise if you're too close.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time for you to explore the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos are usually geared towards getting the most out of the time and money that guests spend. Windows and clocks are usually not present and the exit is sometimes hard to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drink and entertainment to keep them happy and prevent them from leaving.
Some venues offer free alcoholic drinks, but when people are drunk, it affects their judgement and all seasoned gamblers know that it is hugely important to stay sober.
If you are going to drive into the mountains or over mountain passes, you should take into account that there may be snow or ice and that the temperature can be extremely low.
On icy and snow-covered roads, there is little friction, and it drives differently than on asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to cause problems.
Visibility may also be impaired by falling or blowing snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries and do not hinder traffic here.
The biggest tourist attraction in Africa is safaris, which for many visitors are the highlight of their trip.
The term safari refers in popular usage to travel over land to view the magnificent African wildlife, particularly on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars and a standard equipment makes a good view possible.
If you want to see lions, cheetahs and leopards, you need a pair of binoculars. Otherwise, you are unlikely to see them.
A walking safari (also called a 'forest walk' or 'loopsafari') means that you walk for several hours or days in a row.
The Paralympics are from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some parts will be played in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Olympic Games twice, the first time being in 1964.
If you have already booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a tight spot.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies are no longer valid until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets priced at around ¥7,000.
You can dry damp clothes by ironing them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available. You can often borrow these items, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is not available or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can also use a hairdryer if available.
Make sure the fabric does not get too hot (this can cause the fabric to shrink or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are many ways to purify water, and some are more effective at addressing specific risks.
In some areas, it is sufficient to boil water for one minute, in other areas, water must be boiled for several minutes.
Not every filter is equally effective. In case of doubt, it is best to drink water from a sealed bottle from a reliable company.
Travellers may encounter animal pests that are not present in their own country.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Normally, infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that injure or kill people with violence, are not considered pests.
Tax-free shopping means that you can buy goods at certain locations that are exempt from tax and excise duty.
Travellers heading to high-tax countries can sometimes save a significant amount of money on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
Point Marion and Fairmont are connected by the Buffalo to Pittsburgh highway, and you often drive through abandoned hinterland, which makes this route a real challenge.
Are you not used to driving on country roads? Keep your head on. You will encounter many steep hills, narrow streets and sharp bends.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and adjacent areas — usually around 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h — and it's even more important to stick to them here than elsewhere.
Surprisingly, you have a lot more coverage here than in other corners of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries taste great and in Bavaria, the pastries are quite rich and varied, just like the pastries of the southern neighbour, Austria.
You see a lot of fruit pastries. Throughout the year, the pastries contain apples, and in the summer months, cherries and plums.
Many popular German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts, and go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a few small but mighty pastries, try some that are called in the region Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
To make a curry, you need spicy and pungent ingredients, combined with vegetables or meat.
Depending on the amount of liquid, a curry can be 'dry' or 'wet'.
In the interior of North India and also in Pakistan, yoghurt is often used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used instead.
Indonesian cuisine encompasses dishes from 17,000 islands and is an umbrella term for a variety of regional cuisines from across the country.
But without additional information, the term refers to the food that originates from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
The cuisine of Java is now available throughout the archipelago and offers various simple spiced dishes. The most common flavourings in Java are nuts, peppers, sugar (mainly Javanese coconut sugar) and various fragrant herbs.
Foot rests support the rider's feet and hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with more stability, but can also cause safety problems because the feet of a rider can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but gets caught by the stirrup, they can be dragged along with the horse. To reduce the risk, a number of safety measures have been put in place.
Most riders wear firstly riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that can prevent a saddle from being pulled backwards off the horse if a rider falls off.
Cochamó Valley - This is the most popular climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, and has many different large granite walls and boulders.
The mountain peaks offer breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes on the rock faces, which seem to have endless potential.
Downhill winter sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular. You slide down a snow-covered slope with skis or a snowboard on your feet.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, who are sometimes referred to as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations around skiing at a particular location.
Skiing has been around for a very long time: there are cave paintings of skiers that date back to 5000 BC!
The beginnings of skiing date back to at least the 17th century and in 1861 the first recreational ski resort in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Backpacking with skis: this activity is also known as off-piste skiing, skitouring or ski hiking.
It's not exactly the same, but it's like alpine skiing or mountaineering, which is a lot of what's done on steep terrain. You need a lot stiffer skis and boots for that.
You can see the ski route as a hiking route.
In good conditions, you can cover greater distances than when walking, but it is rare that you can reach the speed of cross-country skiing on prepared slopes without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, travelers between different countries have to apply for visas several times and undergo passport checks.
The Schengen area functions in this area almost like a single country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
If you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately for each Schengen country, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique, and some tax offices define an antique as an item that is over 100 years old.
The definition can vary per location. In North America, for example, the age limit is lower than in Europe.
It is possible to label handmade products as antiques, even if they are newer than similar mass-produced products.
For the Sámi, reindeer herding is an important form of livelihood, and the culture surrounding the trade is also very important for many with other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry. They made a living from fishing, hunting and suchlike, and reindeer were usually used as draught animals.
Many Sámi work in modern professions today. In Sápmi, the Sámi area, tourism is an important source of income.
The word 'gypsy' is mainly used by non-Roma, but it is also often considered offensive because of the associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma.
If there is a travel advice for the country you want to travel to, this can have consequences for your travel health insurance or your cancellation insurance.
In addition to the advice of your own government, you can also consult the advice of other governments. However, their advice is aimed at their own residents.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Opinions shall contain only a brief summary of the political situation in a single country.
They often provide a fleeting, general and extremely simplistic image compared to other, more detailed sources.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world. There are several types of weather conditions, which vary based on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
The effects of severe weather include, for example, strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall and forest fires, but also thunderstorms, tornadoes, flash floods and hurricanes.
Snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms are just some examples of regional and seasonal extreme weather phenomena.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks that severe weather conditions in their vicinity may bring, as these may also affect some travel plans.
Anyone who wants to visit a country that is considered a war zone should be professionally trained.
A search on the internet for "survival course in hostile environments" is likely to turn up the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues outlined here in more detail, usually combined with practical experience.
A course normally lasts 2 to 5 days and consists of role-playing, a lot of first aid and occasionally weapons training.
There are many books and magazines with articles about survival in the wilderness, but there are very few publications about war zones.
Travellers who have planned gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have the correct documentation for their return journey.
It varies widely whether governments want to provide passports without a gender (X) or to correct a name or gender on documents.
There is just as much variation in the willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents.
Searches at security checks have also become much more extensive since 11 September 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery can expect to be subjected to this scan without their privacy and dignity being respected.
Surf streams are the recurring flow of waves that break on a reef or similar feature and flow onto the beach.
Due to the submarine topography, the return flow is located in some deeper parts, where a fast current towards deep water can arise.
Most of the deaths are caused by exhaustion as people try to swim against the current, which could be impossible.
When you have escaped from the strong current, swimming back is a piece of cake.
Try to focus on a place where you won't be caught again. Depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, you can also wait for help.
The shock of returning is worse than the culture shock (you have a lesser 'honeymoon feeling'), it lasts longer, and it can be more intense.
Travellers who adapt easily to new cultures sometimes have trouble adapting to their own culture.
If you have lived abroad and then returned, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your own culture in the process.
When I used to travel abroad, I noticed that people were patient and understanding. They understood that travelers had to adjust to a new country.
Patience and understanding are not usually expected for travellers returning home.
For children, the pyramid show with light and sound is one of the most interesting activities in the area.
You see the pyramids in the dark and you see them in silence before the show starts.
Often, the sound of vendors and tourists is always audible here. The story of the light and sound is like that of a book.
The Sphinx forms the background and is the narrator of a long story.
The scenes appear as a projection on the pyramids and the rest of the pyramids are highlighted.
The South Sandwich Islands were discovered in 1819 and have since been claimed by various countries. They have the most bases, with 16 active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others are Livingston Island, and Deception. Here you will find the overflowing crater of an active volcano that serves as a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth is located on the southern side of the peninsula, near the border with the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula give way to the plateau, after which they reappear to form the 360 km long mountain range of Mount Ellsworth, which is crossed by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, also known as the Sentinel Range, includes the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif. Mount Vinson is the highest mountain at 4,892 meters.
A satellite phone may be your only option in remote locations where there is no cellular service.
A satellite phone is not really a replacement for a mobile phone, as you have to be outside in a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
This service is often used by shipping, including recreational vessels, and for expeditions where external data and communication are needed.
Your local phone provider can give you more information on how to connect to this service.
It is becoming increasingly popular for people planning a gap year to travel and learn.
School leavers in particular make use of this to take a gap year before university without it having any negative consequences for their education.
Often, registering for a course abroad during a gap year can increase your chances of returning to higher education in your own country.
Normally, tuition fees must be paid for registration for these educational programs.
Finland is a fantastic destination for boating. The ‘Land of a Thousand Lakes’ also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the archipelagos off the coast.
A yacht is not necessary for the archipelagos or lakes.
The archipelagos off the coast and the largest lakes are indeed big enough for any yacht, but with smaller boats or even a kayak you get a completely different experience.
In Finland, so many people sail in their free time that the ratio of boats to people is one in seven or eight.
The figure is the same as that of Norway, Sweden and New Zealand. Furthermore, it is quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises include a lengthy stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This way, you can spend a few full days in the historic town and spend the night on the ship.
Since 2009, you do not need a separate visa if you only go ashore during a boat excursion.
Some cruises include a visit to the German capital Berlin, but as you can see on the map, Berlin is not close to the sea. A visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be scary for people of all backgrounds and ages, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from many fears that other people have.
Knowing how planes work can help to dispel fears that come from the unknown or the lack of control over the aircraft.
Courier companies are paid handsomely to deliver items quickly. For business documents, purchases or spare parts for a necessary repair, time is often of the essence.
Larger companies could use their own planes for certain routes, but for other routes and smaller companies it became more difficult.
If they ship things by air, it can take days on some routes for them to be unloaded and cleared by customs.
Only checked baggage could be processed more quickly. According to the rules of airlines, there must be a corresponding passenger and that is you.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay for the privilege (or, better still, have your employer pay for it).
However, this is not cheap: the rule of thumb is that you pay about four times economy class for business, and about eleven times for first class.
It usually makes no sense to look for discounts for business class or first class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know full well that there is a group of flyers who are prepared to pay a lot of money to fly somewhere quickly and comfortably, and the airlines charge them accordingly.
Chişinău is the capital of Moldova. The Romanian language is spoken here, but the Russian language is also very common.
Moldova, as a multi-ethnic republic, was plagued by an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria in the east of Moldova. This republic has its own government and currency, but is not recognised by members of the UN.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the fact that the political negotiations have failed.
Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in Moldova.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with around 3.7 million inhabitants, the largest port after Istanbul and a major transport hub.
The once ancient city of Izmir is now a modern, developed and busy commercial center on a bay and is surrounded by mountains.
The broad boulevards, the glass buildings and the modern shopping centres covered with red tiles, the 18th-century markets, the old mosques and churches, but still the city feels more like a Mediterranean, European city than traditionally Turkish.
In the village of Haldarsvík, you can enjoy views of the nearby island of Eysturoy, as well as a special church with eight corners.
There are some fascinating marble pigeon sculptures on a number of graves near the church.
If you have half an hour to spare, you should definitely take a look around this village.
In the north you will find the easily accessible, romantic and fascinating place of Sintra. Sintra became famous among foreigners after Lord Byron spoke highly of the beautiful monuments there.
The Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Head north too and check out the stunning Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (a temple complex), where internationally renowned Marian apparitions took place.
Remember that you are actually just visiting a mass grave, but also a place that has an almost immeasurable significance for a large part of the world population.
Many of the men and women who survived their time here are still alive, and many of them have loved ones who were murdered there, both Jewish and non-Jewish.
Show all appropriate respect, solemnity and dignity during your visit. Do not trivialise the Holocaust or Nazism.
Do not damage the site by making marks or graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer Catalan, the vast majority can understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
Still, most signs are in Catalan, as that is the first official language according to the law.
Spanish is spoken frequently in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the metro are only in Catalan, but unscheduled interruptions are made by an automated system in several languages, including French, Arabic, Spanish, English and even Japanese.
Parisians are known for being selfish, rude and arrogant.
While this is usually just an incorrect stereotype, it can't hurt to put your best foot forward in Paris and act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-bred). This will make it a lot easier to navigate Paris.
The tough exterior of Parisians quickly disappears when you show you are familiar with their way of doing things.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, and this forested area consists mainly of beech, spruce and pine trees, and includes a combination of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
There are a great many different plant communities, because of the different microclimates, the different types of soil and the varying differences in altitude.
This area is also the habitat of a very wide range of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat and the capercaillie can be found, in addition to all kinds of more common species.
When women visit a monastery, they are required to wear a skirt to their knees and their shoulders must be covered.
You usually get a hood as a woman if you arrive at a monastery unprepared, but if you bring your own copy, with nice screaming colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you kindly.
On the other hand, men must wear pants that reach at least above the knee.
You can also borrow these from the stock at the entrance, but this clothing is not washed after each use, so you might not feel comfortable with that. One size fits all for men!
Like many other Mediterranean regions, Mallorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses a lot of olive oil.
A simple and popular dish for dinner, especially during the summer months, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and whatever flavourings are available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Nouns, just like Sie what you mean, always have a capital letter at the beginning, even if they are in the middle of a sentence.
This is how you make a big difference between a number of verbs and objects.
It also probably makes reading easier. However, writing is more complicated because you have to figure out whether a verb or adjective should be used as a noun.
Most Italian words are written exactly as they are pronounced, so pronunciation is generally not a problem.
You have to pay the most attention to the c and the g. The pronunciation of these letters depends on the vowel that follows.
You also have to pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means sweetheart, while carro means car.
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Reading this introduction to the grammar will teach you a lot about the grammar of Persian and help you understand sentences.
It is quite logical that if you know a Romance language, it is easier for you to learn Portuguese.
But people who speak a bit of Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is so similar that you don't have to learn it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are now obsolete, and serve as museums or educational landmarks.
Light pollution was not such a big problem back then, so they were often built in cities or on campuses, more accessible than those of today.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities built in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami is the act of viewing cherry blossoms and has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
In China, plum blossoms were the favorite flowers and that is where the concept came from.
Japan's first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor and were intended only for himself and other aristocrats at the imperial court.
Plants look best in a natural environment, which should quell the urge to remove even "just one" species.
If you collect samples during a visit to a landscaped garden, you will be denied access to the garden immediately and without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to stay, very easy to navigate and almost everything is available upon arrival.
But if you are in the "high tropics," just a few degrees north of the equator, you experience both heat (always) and strong sun (when the air is clear, which is less often).
There are also some buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Isaac, Jacob, Abraham and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you take to Hebron actually goes there and doesn't just drive to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great holiday destination.
You can visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, book a cruise to the interesting cities along the Danube or take a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also provide popular walking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
People who do not believe in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world have also adopted many traditions that are associated with the holiday.
There is a tradition whereby you stay up all Easter night until you can see the sunrise at some point.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could just as well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
In traditional churches, a Easter Vigil is often held on the Saturday evening of the Easter weekend. Congregations often celebrate a feast in honor of the resurrection of Christ at midnight.
All the animals that originally arrived at the islands came here by swimming, flying or drifting.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, it was not possible for mammals to make the journey, so the giant tortoise became the most common grazing mammal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans first set foot on the Galapagos, a variety of mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
During the winter, polar night occurs in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, which means that the sun does not actually rise.
There is a good chance that you will be able to see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be dark most of the day and night.
The areas are sparsely populated and therefore light pollution is not a problem, which means you can also enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese work environment is more structured and formal than in the Western world.
The standard work clothing is a uniform and colleagues call each other by their last name or job title.
Unity in the workplace is of crucial importance. The focus is on group performance rather than on rewarding individual work performance.
Employees often need permission from their supervisors before they can make a decision, and they are expected to follow their supervisors' instructions without question.
