The US Olympic Committee has the support of USA Gymnastics and understands that it is necessary for the Olympic family to promote a safe place for all athletes.
We join the USOC in stating that it is best for our athletes and clubs, and their sport, to make meaningful changes to our organization rather than pursuing certification.

This not only proves the already widespread theory that at least certain dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional placement.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
The researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development, because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, or rachis, but do have other feather characteristics - such as barbs.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but to regulate temperature or for appearance. The researchers suggested that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, but that this monster shows adult feathers and therefore not the down of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, despite the fact that it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the creature had the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chick.

Commons administrator Adam Cuerden expressed his frustrations about the deletion during his interview with Wikinews last month.
'He [Wales] basically lied to us from the beginning. Firstly by pretending it was about legal reasons. Secondly by pretending to listen to us, until he removed the art.'
The community's frustrations have resulted in the current push to establish policies regarding the site's sexual content, which hosts millions of pieces of media content under an open license.
The completed work was mainly theoretical in nature, but the program was written for the simulation of observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The team was looking for the effect that would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the universe and that of the Milky Way.
Similar to how the moon exerts force on the Earth, leading to tides, the Milky Way exerts force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The researchers concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter in a galaxy is located around it, in a kind of ring, and consists of a large number of smaller particles.

During the day they are cooler than the surrounding surface and at night they are warmer.
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature. What is consistent is that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, there is hardly any technology needed for voting: voters go into a booth and put a pre-printed piece of paper in an envelope indicating which candidate they are voting for.
Officials first check the identity of the voter. Then the voter inserts the envelope into the ballot box and then signs the voting register.
The process is relatively tightly regulated in France's electoral law.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent, so that both voters and observers can see that at the start of the voting there are no envelopes in the box and that no other envelopes are added than those of registered and authorized voters.
The candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. Volunteers count the votes in the evening under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

Four skiers from the women's group for the sitting slalom were unable to finish their runs and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom were unable to qualify during the race.
The stolen laptop and mobile phone were found by the police of Madhya Pradesh.
According to Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya, five of the rapists of the Swedish woman have been arrested and they found her mobile phone and laptop.
Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar are the suspects.
According to police commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the suspects had covered their faces when they appeared in court.
There were three people in the house when the car hit the house, but none of them were injured.
However, the driver did suffer serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services tried to free the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially he was admitted to Great Yarmouth, at the James Paget Hospital.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been convicted at Edinburgh Sheriff Court of murdering her son.
She is in custody awaiting the indictment and trial, but the eyewitness report is possibly intended because her story has been widely published.
This is standard practice in the rest of the UK, but justice in Scotland works differently and courts have deemed the publication of photos as potentially detrimental.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that 'journalists are playing a dangerous game when they publish photos etc. of suspects.'
Crown Office has overall responsibility for prosecutions and has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made, at least until charges are brought.
According to sources, the document refers to a dispute settlement, something the Palestinians wanted based on the borders before the Middle East war in 1967.
Other topics discussed were the future status of Jerusalem, a city that is holy to both peoples, and the problems in the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands that there be a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of an agreement, but the PA is only willing to accept a presence of five years.
Shooters in the additional trial for pest control had to be closely monitored by forest rangers, as the trial was followed and its effectiveness was assessed.
In a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director for park conservation and heritage at the NPWS, the four chosen marksmen for the first shooting operation had received extensive safety and training instructions.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a nine-member new provisional electoral council (Provisional Electoral Council or CEP).
With this, Martelly has achieved a CEP five times in the past four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the dismissal of the previous National Electoral Council, as part of a package of measures to ensure new elections in the country.
The commission was established by Martelly in response to widespread protests against the government that have taken place since October.
The sometimes violent protests were caused by the failure to hold elections, some of which should have taken place as early as 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of defective iPods overheating, which in total led to six fires and four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of the 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating that the company called "not serious."
'Very regrettable', was the ministry's response to the fact that Apple has postponed the report.
Mariana was hit by the earthquake at 07.19 local time (Friday 21.19 GMT).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Agency said no damage was reported across the territory.
In addition, the National Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no tsunami warning.
In Manila, the Philippine capital, a former Philippine policeman has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been brought to safety and so far at least six fatalities have been confirmed.
Six hostages were released earlier, including children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers returned in exchange for an older woman who needed to use the toilet. Mendoza was eventually shot.
Liggins went to work in medicine, following in his father's footsteps.
Trained as a midwife, he started working in 1959 at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
When he was working at the hospital, Liggins did research on premature birth in his free time.
His research showed that the maturation of the fetal lungs of babies was accelerated by the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two "black boxes" containing flight recorders.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, 'Luna was the first 'Queen of Extreme'. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons. As unique as she was. A strong woman.'
Dustin 'Goldust' Runnels stated that 'Luna was as weird as me... maybe even weirder... I love her and will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place'.
Of the 1400 people surveyed for the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic rose by 8 per cent since 2008.
Outgoing Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the campaign for the 2010 federal elections that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of the participants in this poll supported this position. They want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
29 per cent of respondents thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while at the other end of the spectrum, 31 per cent said it should never happen.
The Olympic gold medal winner swam the 100 and 200 meter freestyle and three relay races during the Commonwealth Games, but his condition was called into question due to his complaints.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to relieve his pain because it's banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source of water on Earth, along with organic material that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to gain insight into the way planets are formed. They would especially like to know how the Earth was formed, given the fact that it has been a long time since comets collided with the Earth.
Cuomo (53) was inaugurated as governor earlier this year and last month signed a law legalizing same-sex marriages.
He called the rumors 'political nonsense and chatter'.
It is speculated that he wants to run for the presidency in 2016.
With the NextGen system, planes could take shorter routes, according to the FAA, which would save millions of tons of fuel annually and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike older ground radar technologies, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft much better, and provide pilots with clearer information.
No extra transport is being deployed and no above-ground trains are stopping at Wembley; in addition, the parking lots and the P&R are not accessible on the site.
A possible lack of transport increased the likelihood that the match would be played behind closed doors and without supporters.
A study published on Tuesday in the scientific journal Science was about the formation of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved within two generations. It was thought that this process took much longer because the crossing of a native Darwin's finch, the medium ground finch, with an immigrant cactus ground finch, the Española ground finch, took longer.
Gold can be worked into many shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into a narrow wire that can be twisted and braided. It can also be forged or rolled into plates.
Once it has been made very thin, it can be stuck onto another metal. It can even be made so thin that it was sometimes used for the decoration of hand-painted illustrations in books that were called 'illuminated manuscripts'.
This is called the pH value of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator using beetroot juice.
Then the color of the cabbage juice changes based on the acidity (acidic to basic or alkaline) of the chemical.
The pH value is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance that has been tested.
Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron, and hydrogen ions are protons without electrons.
Mix both dry powders together, wet and clean your hands and make a ball out of it.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjodaro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to an advanced sewage system.
Sewage remains have been found in houses in the Minoan cities on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
Furthermore, there were already toilets in China, Egypt and Persia in ancient times. In the Roman era, toilets were often part of a public bathhouse, where both ladies and gentlemen gathered in a mixed group.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
As soon as the space satellite receives the call, it is immediately sent back.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and images.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, you need a huge rocket that is more than 30 meters long.
The wheel has changed the world incredibly. The most important thing the wheel has given us is easier and faster transportation.
The train, the car and many other means of transport are the result of this.
There are medium-sized felines that eat prey of medium size, from hares to antelopes and deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (such as stray cats kept as pets) that hunt in larger numbers on smaller prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
Their success comes from the idea of a niche, a special job that each cat has, which means they don't compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called prides.
Troops consist of one to three adult males who are related to each other and also have up to thirty females and cubs.
The women are usually closely related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions behaves much like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that surprisingly resemble lions (but not other big cats), and which are very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (although not well), swim, jump long distances and has five times the pulling power of a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger does not roar with full force like a lion. It is more like he growls an entire sentence.
The favourite meal of ocelots are small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. The ocelot hunts almost exclusively on animals that are much smaller than he is himself.
Scholars suspect that ocelots use their sense of smell to hunt small animals (their prey), by smelling the ground where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision and move around very inconspicuously. Ocelots hunt for prey by blending in with their surroundings and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the larger population from which they came (for example, by moving across a mountain range or river, or if they are moved to another island, from which they cannot easily return), they are often in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, different resources and different enemies are present, so the new population must adapt or change its approach in order to be able to compete.
Because they still need the same adaptations as before, the original population has not changed at all.
As the new population began to adapt to the new environment, they also began to look less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different in appearance that you can no longer call them the same species.
This process is called speciation and simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe in and they absorb carbon dioxide that people breathe out.
Through photosynthesis, the plants get their nutrients from the sun. They also provide shade.
Our houses and clothes are made from plants. We mainly eat plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain of that time. He had nothing to fear from anyone, except from other Mosasauruses.
Its long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an extra set in the palate, which means that nothing or nobody could escape from it.
It is not certain, but it is possible that its tongue was forked. It ate turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and maybe even its own species.
In water areas, nothing was safe from his attacks; even huge dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex were no match for him.
Although much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans also had their share of exotic or unusual delicacies, including wild boar, peacocks, snails and a kind of rodent called a dormouse.
In addition, there was another difference; poor people and women sat on chairs during meals, but rich men liked to hold a banquet where they lay on their sides during the meal.
Meals from Roman antiquity do not contain any food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa. Moreover, no ancient Roman ever ate a turkey.
The Babylonians made a primary temple for all their gods. This temple was seen as the god's own house.
Offerings were made to the gods and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods by organizing ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had a public courtyard and a back room that was only accessible to priests.
Sometimes, as part of the temples, towers in the form of pyramids were built, called ziggoerats.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
Houses were not of great importance in the warm climate of the Middle East.
The daily life of the Hebrew family often took place outside.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were no more than a counter along the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, and therefore wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland had few inhabitants. According to Norse sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, found Greenland on his way west and gave it its name.
He made this discovery, but at that time there were already Eskimo tribes living there.
Although they were all 'Scandinavian' countries, the people, the royal families, customs and history of Sweden, Iceland, Denmark and Norway were very different from each other.
After watching the movie National Treasure, you might think that there is a treasure map hidden behind the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is based on a misunderstanding. There is something written on the back, but it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the American Declaration of Independence are the words 'Original American Declaration of Independence, dated 4 July 1776'. The text is upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is certain that the large parchment (29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage at some point.
It seems therefore that the designation was simply added as a kind of label.
Thanks to the D-Day landings and the battles that followed, the north of France was liberated. However, the south remained occupied.
It was ruled by Vichy France. These were French people who sided with the Germans in 1940 and thus allied themselves with the enemy instead of fighting against them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France with Operation Dragoon.
The Americans and the Free French had liberated southern France in just two weeks. Then they set off for Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together in a society.
The term civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state; and that also defines the size of society in a certain way.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilization with a culture suggests that knowledge is passed on over multiple generations, a lasting cultural footprint and balanced distribution.
When minority cultures disappear, they often leave no relevant historical evidence, so they are not officially recognized as civilizations.
During the revolution, thirteen states under the Articles of Confederation formed a weak central government, consisting solely of a congress.
The congress lacked the power to levy taxes, because there was no national executive or judicial branch, and for implementing all decisions it relied on state authorities, who often refused to cooperate.
It also did not have the authority to ignore tax laws and rates between states.
First, all states had to unanimously agree to the articles before they could be amended, but the states did not take the national government seriously, so their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, together with the German team, the second most successful team worldwide and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, sword fighting, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are especially popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan consists of almost 7,000 islands (with Honshu being the largest island). This makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to as a 'peninsula' geographically speaking
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century, when sailors from Europe sailed past the island and gave it the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch VOC settled in southwestern Taiwan as a base, where the VOC tackled the indigenous grain production processes and put Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In the year 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan were conquered by troops of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912), after which Taiwan was annexed as a province of the Qing Empire in the year 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, in which the sovereignty over Taiwan was transferred to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Built up of three large structures, Machu Picchu consists of Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room with Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt so that tourists can get a better idea of what they looked like before.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored. The renovation is still ongoing.
For example, the most common photo format for still images worldwide is 35 mm, which was the usual film format at the end of the analog film era.
These are still produced today, although it is mainly the ratio of the image that the image sensor of the digital camera has taken over.
Strangely enough, 35 mm film is actually 36 mm wide, with a height of 24 mm.
The aspect ratio of this size (divide by twelve to get the simplest ratio of whole numbers) would be 3:2 in that case.
Many common aspect ratios (e.g. APS-like aspect ratios) are equal to or a close approximation of this aspect ratio.
The thirds rule, which is widely abused and ridiculed by many, is a simple guideline that makes the image dynamic, yet also clear.
The most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines. This divides the image vertically and horizontally into three parts (see example).
During this period in Europe's history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was under fire.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united European states, despite differences in language and customs.
From the king to the common citizen, his all-pervasive power affected everyone.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to combat suffering and poverty, and the church has financial resources for this reason.
The church had been the central authority in Rome for over a thousand years, and this relationship of power and money led many people to begin to question whether this principle was being upheld.
Great Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany shortly after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy proved effective, as it was no longer possible to deliver vital supplies to military personnel and civilians. However, this blockade violated the generally accepted international law that has been established over the past two centuries in various international agreements.
Great Britain placed mines in international waters, so that ships could no longer sail in whole parts of the ocean, which was dangerous even for neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to the country's unrestrained submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations had an attitude of pacifism and isolationism.
After the First World War, states wanted to prevent such horrors from ever happening again.
Tesla emigrated to the United States of America in 1884 to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
When he came to the United States, he only had 4 cents, a collection of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous boss) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each phase of China or each ruling family had a distinct dynasty.
There was also an unstable period between the different dynasties in which the provinces were divided. The most famous was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which took place in the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
At that time, there were fierce wars between different nobles who fought for the throne.
In the history of ancient China, the Three Kingdoms period is recorded as one of the bloodiest. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest position in the grand palace in Xi'an.
The Revolution had major social and political consequences, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolute monarchy to republicanism, nationalism, and the idea that the country belongs to its inhabitants rather than a single leader.
After the revolution, all male applicants were able to obtain positions, so that the most ambitious and suitable candidates could succeed.
The same applies to the army. Army ranks are no longer based on a person's class but on the calibre of the person.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working class in other countries to revolt.
Mohammed was intensively involved with supernatural matters. He often went to a cave for contemplation, which later became known as the Cave of Hira in the Noer Mountains.
The cave itself, which has withstood the test of time, gives a very vivid picture of the spirituality of Mohammed.
The cave is located on one of the mountain peaks on the north side of Mecca and is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
Even if it was known that the cave existed, it was not easy to find. Once inside the cave, total isolation prevails.
The only thing to see is the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. From the cave, there is very little of this world to see or hear.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still stands.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC and is one of the many large pyramid structures in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or 'pyramids of Giza' in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, a number of temples and the Great Sphinx.
The large pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu. Many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built as tributes to Khufu's wives and family members.
The up-bow sign looks like a V and the down-bow sign looks like a little dot or a square with the bottom missing.
Above means that you have to start at the point and push the bow away. Below means that you have to start at the bow frog (the place where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An upward movement usually produces a softer sound, while a downward movement produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
Take the freedom to sketch your personal signs, but do not forget that the printed note signs are there for a musical reason, so they usually have to be respected.
A group of market women on 6 October 1789 escorted the terrified Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Therese aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged 4), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, from Versailles to Paris.
They rode back to the French capital in a carriage, surrounded by cheering and threatening crowds that threatened the royal couple.
Due to the actions of the crowd, the king and queen were forced to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At one point, someone in the crowd held up the head of a royal guard who had been murdered in Versailles in front of the terrified eyes of the queen.
The war costs of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the people of the Philippines.
They were imposed on the American colonial regime to pay taxes to finance a large part of the costs and the interest on bonds was issued through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government.
American imperialism rested to a large extent on the enormous profits of the long-term exploitation of the Philippines.
To understand the Templars, one must know what the context was that gave rise to the order.
The era in which this happened is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th century (1000-1300 AD).
After the early Middle Ages came the High Middle Ages, which were in turn followed by the Late Middle Ages, which usually end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term for a broad range of ideas in practice: from technological determinism or the technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have these two general views: the development of technology follows a trajectory that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, some people will say that the arrival of the car automatically leads to the construction of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically feasible for just a few cars. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The massive car ownership also leads to a greater number of accidents on the road, which leads to the development of new techniques in the field of healthcare to repair the human body.
Romanticism included a large component of cultural determinism, which came from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In Romanticism, geography formed the individual and over time, habits and cultures arose from this geography. These formed a harmonious society and were better than the arbitrarily imposed laws.
Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe, just as Paris is the current fashion capital.
It was known as an epicenter of luxury from around 400 AD to around 1100 AD.
The status of the empire declined in the 12th century, mainly because the crusaders returned with silk and spices that were more valuable than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
Around this time, Paris also took over the title of fashion capital from Constantinople.
Gothic architecture reached its peak in the 10th, 11th and 14th centuries.
Clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture from the east in the beginning.
However, due to the slow communication channels, styles in the west were 25 to 30 years behind.
At the end of the Middle Ages, a distinct style began to develop in Western Europe. One of the biggest developments was the result of the Crusades: people began to use buttons to fasten their clothing.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture in which enough food is produced to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system that is usually organic. It uses stored seed from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
In the past, most farmers worked in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by societal norms, giving them the opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender of their members.
A subculture can be defined by the following types of qualities: linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic or one or more of these factors combined.
Members of a subculture often show which group they belong to through a certain symbolic style in what they wear, how they behave and the jargon they speak.
One of the most commonly used methods for illustrating the importance of socialization was the few regrettable cases of children who, through neglect, adversity, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their upbringing.
They are called 'wolf children' or 'wild children'. Some wolf children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); sometimes the child was abandoned because the parents did not want to accept the child's serious mental or physical disability.
Unmanageable children may have experienced severe child abuse or a serious trauma before they were abandoned or before they ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived in the wilderness alone.
A feral child who has not been raised by humans may exhibit behaviors resembling those of the animal that cared for the child (within physical limits), such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Learning on a project basis should simplify and make education more interesting, but scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a tool to support individuals who are dealing with a new learning experience, for example a new computer program or who are starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real. A teacher is a form of support, for example, but so is the paperclip man from Microsoft Office.
There is virtual scaffolding built into the software that asks questions, provides memory aids, and explains procedures that might be difficult for students to understand without help.
There are several reasons why children end up in foster care, such as neglect, abuse and exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are not well cared for, where they are not loved and where they cannot develop, but this is still happening.
We consider the foster care system to be a safe zone for these children.
The intention is that foster care provides a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable healthcare.
In foster care, all needs that were neglected in the previous home must be met.
On the internet, elements of interpersonal and mass communication are combined.
The different characters of the internet lead to new dimensions with regard to the application of the Uses & Gratifications theory.
'Learning' and 'socialisation' are proposed, for example, as important reasons for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) introduced new motivation aspects such as 'personal involvement' and 'sustained relationships' when they examined audience responses to websites.
The use of video recordings led to remarkable findings in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
It is stated in particular that no one can recognize a lie by only paying attention to micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks described in his essay The President's Speech how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess its sincerity.
He even suggested that other species, such as domestic dogs, also have the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variants: hidden and visible.
Mutation adds new genetic variation; selection eliminates this variation from the pool of expressed variation.
For each generation, variation between the two groups is achieved through recombination and segregation.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans can hardly get the necessary amino acids from the plant sources found on the savannah.
Failure to comply can have serious consequences: growth retardation, malnutrition and ultimately even death.
The easiest plant-based sources to find are the proteins in leaves and legumes, but unless they are cooked, they are difficult for primates like us to digest.
Not only is animal food (ants, termites, eggs) easily digestible, but it also contains a lot of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their 'protein problem' in the same way that chimpanzees in the savannah solve this problem today.
Sleep interruption means that you wake up for a reason during your normal sleep period and that you fall asleep again within a short time (10–60 minutes).
This is quite easy by using a relatively soft alarm clock that brings you back to your consciousness without you immediately becoming fully awake.
If you turn off your clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room. This way, you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on the biorhythm are, for example, drinking a lot of liquid before going to bed (and then especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic). This means you will have to get up to go to the toilet.
The amount of inner calm a person has is in contrast to the amount of stress a person carries in his or her body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive the vitality present. Every human being is capable of achieving satisfaction and total rest.
Everyone can enlighten their mind. Only your own stress and negativity stand in the way of this goal.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha. However, this form of Buddhism has been expanded with the Mahayana path of love and with a large number of techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism consists of a relatively simple core of kundalini yoga, meditation and a following of universal love.
Through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualized images, the energy of Kundalini yoga (enlightenment energy) is awakened.
The core of Tibetan meditation is yoga with a deity as the focus. With the help of the visualization of different deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated and consciousness is brought into an enlightened state.
Because Germany was a common enemy in World War II, cooperation between the USSR and the USA was established. When the war was over, conflicts between system, process and culture caused the countries to fall out with each other.
The former allies were directly opposed to each other two years after the end of the war, this was the beginning of the Cold War.
The war would last 40 years and there were proxy battles fought on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
The Polish defensive forces held out until 17 September 1939, after which they had to retreat and reorganize along the bridgehead in Romania.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete overnight when 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded and formed the Latvian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying the eastern parts of Poland, in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international peace treaties that were both bilateral and multilateral.
Goods transport by ship is the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, it is the task of the navy to ensure that a country retains the ability to transport people and goods, while the enemy's ability to transport people and goods is hindered.
The US tried to get men and material across the Atlantic to the British and this North Atlantic campaign of WWII is one of the most notable recent examples.
The German navy tried to stop this traffic at the same time, mainly using U-boats.
Like the rest of Europe, Britain would probably have fallen into German hands if the Allies had failed.
It seems that the goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Iranian Zagros Mountains.
In ancient times, cultures and tribes started to keep them so that they could always easily get hair, meat, milk and skins.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds on a hill or other grazing area. They were then guarded by goat herders, just like the more well-known sheep herder was often a child or young person. Today, herding is still done in the same way.
In the 16th century, horse-drawn railways were already being built in England.
Although horse railways only consisted of a plank rail, the horses had to run faster and pull larger loads than on the somewhat difficult roads of that time.
Crossbeams were used quite early on to keep the rails in place, but gradually people realised that rails would be more efficient if there was an iron point on the top.
This soon became the standard practice, but the iron resulted in more wear on the wooden carriage wheels.
Iron wheels eventually replaced the wooden ones. In 1767, the first completely iron rails were laid.
The first form of transport we know of is walking. People started walking upright two million years ago when the Homo Erectus emerged (which means upright man).
Their predecessor, the Australopithecus, walked less upright.
Two-legged specializations are found in fossils of the Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago. The Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly, join an environmental movement or even take action to mitigate future suffering.
In many cases, it is just like symptomatic treatment. But if we want more than a temporary solution, we need to identify the cause of the problems and eliminate them.
The scientific and technological developments of human society have clearly and profoundly changed the earth. Moreover, overpopulation and extravagant human lifestyles have exacerbated the problems.
After the Declaration of Independence was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent to John Dunlap's printing office a few blocks away. This draft was signed by the President of the Continental Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night. These are now better known as 'Dunlap broadsides'.
John Nixon first delivered the public reading of the document on July 8 in the garden of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6 and read to his troops in New York on July 9. Another copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists believe that there is still a species of dinosaur alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them to be dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still remind us of dinosaurs.
They have claws and scales on their feet, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs, just like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Manipulating data that is encoded in binary digits forms the basis for almost all computers used today.
A binary number can only have two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits (and in computer language 'bits').
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms such as vomiting are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The presence of open boxes of medication or toxic household chemicals is the best indication of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
This group of insects is formally called 'bedbugs' by entomologists.
This term comes from an age-old agreement with bedbugs, which are insects that can parasitize humans very well.
Both bed bugs and red bug bugs are nest-bound, they have adapted to live in the nest or the house of their host.
In the US, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in adults of both younger and middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system. This includes the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their interest, or that of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to give their baby up for adoption.
In an adoption, the parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can raise the child.
Discovering how the world works through the scientific method is the most important goal of science. This method is the guideline for most scientific research.
Yet it is about more than just experiments; an experiment is a test to exclude one or more potential assumptions, to raise questions and to make observations, as a guideline for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and in particular on the Bible in Latin.
The views of Aristotle regarding science, including psychology, were accepted.
The West understood Greek philosophy and science less and less as knowledge of Greek declined.
In physiological and behavioral observations of rhythms, there is often a strong dependence on endogenous processes and the production via the biological clock.
Most creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, live according to periodic rhythms. These are not just responses to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that run a cycle for a certain period of time, even if no external signals are given for this.
The experiment by Hershey and Chase was one of the most important indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were carried out. In one experiment, the DNA in the phage was marked with a radioactive phosphorus, and in the other experiment, the protein of the phage was marked with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type, the importance of the genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells are hereditary. Other mutations can cause cells to die or cancer to develop.
Nature tourism attracts people who like to visit nature reserves because they want to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
On the spot, one can go hunting, fishing, take photographs, observe birds, go to parks and study the ecosystem, among other things.
An example is visiting, photographing and learning about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people from small villages drive to their workplace and pass people whose workplace is located in the village they just left.
Everyone in this dynamic transport shuttle is in some way connected to and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science shows that this enormous carbon economy means that the biosphere is no longer in the stable state that allowed human evolution to take place over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems, and almost everyone complains about them.
In developed countries, problems with water quality or collapsing bridges are rarely seen in comparison.
Why is it that so many complaints arise in transport systems, why does it go wrong every day? Are transport technicians simply incompetent? Or is it something more fundamental?
In traffic flow, attention is paid to the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between the individuals.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow, because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave in a fairly predictable way, which means that traffic flows show a certain degree of consistency and that something can be said about this in the field of mathematics.
Connections have been made between the three core properties to better represent traffic handling: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
With the help of these relationships, the planning, design and operation of road construction facilities is facilitated.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Thanks to their ability to fly, they could escape from enemies more easily and find food and mating partners more efficiently.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along their body.
This allows them to hide in a larger number of small places from predators.
Currently, only dragonflies and mayflies cannot fold their wings.
A few thousand years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
There were people who thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, and the Sun too (and other stars).
This sounds pretty logical, because you don't feel the earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the world's largest and second-longest river and carries more than 8 times as much water as the second-largest.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, with a width of up to six miles in some places.
At least 20% of all the water that flows into the sea via rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. The water comes from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remain unsurpassed in terms of size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monument of their predecessors, which was already more than a thousand years old at the time.
There are approximately 800 inhabitants in Vatican City. This is the smallest independent country in the world and also the country with the lowest population.
Italian is the official language for official communication and laws of Vatican City.
Italian is the language most spoken by the people who work there, while Latin is widely used during religious ceremonies.
Everyone who lives in Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People have known the most basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, since ancient times, because they are all found in nature and it is fairly easy to mine them with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle speculated that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This seemed more like what we know of the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, but he also theorized that they transition into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are, in simple terms, a combination of at least two metals. As you probably know, the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium fall under the metals. There are of course also metals such as silver and gold.
Alloys can also contain a small amount of non-metal elements, for example carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that there are a trillion of them in the dot at the end of this sentence.
That is why the pencil was a faithful friend to many people when it was launched.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods have emerged, the pen has lost its status and is used much less.
Nowadays, people write messages on a computer screen without ever needing a pencil sharpener.
You can wonder what will happen to the keyboard as soon as something new comes on the market.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. When the nucleus is split again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means that they fall apart at the slightest provocation.
The surface of the moon is characterized by dust and rocks. The crust is the outermost layer of the moon.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km thick on the other side.
The crust is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more cracks on the side, because the crust is thinner there. Lava could more easily reach the surface there.
Content theories aim to find out what motivates people and what appeals to them.
This theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or desires that become internalized as they mature.
With these theories, they want to examine the reasons why certain people want certain things and which environmental factors influence them to do certain things or not.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's motivation-hygiene theory.
In general, two approaches emerge when managers start leading their former colleagues. In one approach, they try to act as an equal.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions and disciplinary measures, to conduct evaluation interviews, to delegate and to hold people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, they transform into an unrecognizable individual, feeling the need to change everything the team has done so far and wanting to take ownership of everything.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
Often, this behavior leads to a gap between the leaders and the team members.
Virtual teams must meet the same standards of excellence as regular teams, although there are some minor differences.
In most cases, virtual team members are the first point of contact for their immediate physical group.
Often they are more independent than traditional team members, because their teams can meet across different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The idea of a truly 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, pp 109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to whom each member reports. The invisible team also sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organization want to embark on the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One of the goals for putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and resourcefulness come to the fore when all available resources within the functional departments of an organization are effectively deployed.
The result of this is that the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
To enable innovation in an organization, management must stimulate a culture in which innovation, shared knowledge and organizational learning are central.
According to Angel (2006), organizations can perform better with an approach based on the continuum model.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to studying cognition, allowing the research area to be narrowed down and more accurate data to be collected.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, wounds, and tumors can affect behavior and lead to changes in mental ability.
Because there are more and more new technologies, we are learning more and more about the structures and processes in the brain.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to develop simulation models that allow us to gain more insight into the processes of our mind.
AI immediately makes most people think of science fiction, but it is also an essential part of computer science. It is used in research into machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
Developing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior falls under research into AI.
Some examples are management, planning, the ability to answer diagnoses and customer questions, and recognition of handwriting, voice, and face.
These have become separate disciplines for finding solutions to problems in real life.
Today, this artificial intelligence system is widely used in the economic, medical, technical and military fields, such as in various software applications for PCs and video games.
Many excursions are planned for each class. A teacher would often take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Thanks to technological developments, virtual excursions are now possible. This allows students to view the artefacts in a museum, take a look inside an aquarium or see beautiful works of art from the classroom.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital, which is redesigned every year and whose earlier versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students to write better. Often their grammar and spelling are poor at first, but this quickly changes because they have an audience.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve his writing in order to avoid criticism.
By blogging, 'students are also forced to learn more about the world around them'. The need to keep the audience interested inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
When used appropriately, blogs can help students develop analytical skills and critical thinking; by actively engaging in discussion on the internet, students can find their own place in the context of other people's material and at the same time determine their own position on certain issues' (Oravec, 2002).
The bilingual capital of Canada is the charming Ottawa, full of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and future.
Further south you will find the Niagara Falls, in the north you will find the beautiful untouched Muskoka and more.
This kind of thing makes Ontario typical Canadian in the eyes of outsiders.
Further north, large areas are sparsely populated and some of these areas are even almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that will surprise many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than the total population of Canada.
The East African islands are located along the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and in terms of fauna it is almost a separate continent.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent countries or are connected to France and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought with them the Islamic faith, which then spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India, which marked the beginning of European influence and colonization in the 15th century.
The region is bordered to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean and to the north by the Sahel region.
Women: Female travelers are advised to say they are married, whether or not it is true.
It also helps to put on rings (not too expensive-looking rings).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to behaviour that they see as intimidating and that it is common to be followed, touched on the arm, etc.
Be clear when you reject a man and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences don't speak well of this!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen. The city was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids and was known under the name of Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the port and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca. After an earthquake in 1755, they left the city again.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and named it Daru l-Bayad. The Spanish traders who established their trading base here gave it the name Casablanca.
In Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
Around the old Medina you will find many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan items, such as tagines, pots, leather products, water pipes and other trinkets, but it is purely aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The city is located near Rwanda, in the far east.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed when the Nyiragongo volcano spewed lava and buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma itself is relatively safe, you should check the situation regarding the ongoing fighting in the province of North Kivu before visiting outside of Goma.
In addition, the city is the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and you can find some of the most affordable trips for Mountain Gorilla tracking in Africa there.
You can get around Goma by boda-boda (a motorcycle taxi). The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
'Timbuktu' is relatively inaccessible and is therefore used today as a metaphor for exotic, far-off lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a dilapidated city, although the city's reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered world heritage sites because of desert storms.
It was one of the key stops on the PBS exhibition Special Treasures from the African World of Henry Louis Gates.
The city differs from the other cities in the country because it has a more Arabic appearance than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique in the east, along the border with Zimbabwe in the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park is 19,500 square kilometers in size, divided into 14 different eco-zones, where various wild animal species are kept.
As a major attraction in South Africa, this park is the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, there are daily conservation fees and entrance fees that apply.
It can also be useful to buy a Wild Card. These offer access to certain parts of parks in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
The entire territory of Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong, which is considered the most important place by many tourists.
The large number of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline has already been compared to a glittering bar graph that is visible thanks to the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the waterfront of Kowloon on the other side.
The vast majority of the population of the island of Hong Kong lives very close to each other on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is where the British colonists settled, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forests in the world and stretch 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast into Indian and Bengali territory.
The Sundarbans are now officially included on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part within the Indian borders is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are more than just mangrove swamps — they also boast some of the last mighty patches of jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which a third is peat and marshland.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife reserve since 1966 and the area is now home to an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 axis deer.
During the day, buses depart from the station on the border of the districts (opposite the river). Most depart between 6.30 and 7.30 am, mainly in the direction of the east and Jakar/Bumthang.
It is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance, because the local buses are often fully booked.
In most neighborhoods, small Japanese Coaster buses run that are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis can take you quickly and comfortably to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that crosses the Oyapock River to connect the Brazilian city of Oiapoque and the French Guianese city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock.
The two towers are 83 meters high. The building is 378 meters long and has two passages with a width of 3.50 meters.
The clearance height under the bridge is 15 meters. In August 2011, the construction of the bridge was completed, but it only opened for traffic in March 2017.
According to the planning, the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017. The Brazilian customs posts are expected to be ready for use by then.
The Guaraní were the most prominent indigenous group. They lived in the area that is now eastern Paraguay, lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced self-sufficient agriculture.
In the province of Chaco, other indigenous tribes lived, including the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who found their food by hunting, fishing and gathering.
Paraguay, formerly also called 'the great province of India', emerged in the 16th century when Spanish colonists encountered the indigenous population.
This was followed by a three-century colonisation period under the Spanish.
Asunción was founded in 1537 and since then Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the largest tournament of the year takes place on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Here, at other times of the year, smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen.
Check out the Asociación Argentina de Polo for more information on tournaments and buying tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is worth approximately one British pound (GBP).
On the islands there is only one bank, namely in Stanley opposite the FIC West store. Here you can exchange money.
In general, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands and in Stanley you can often pay with credit cards and US dollars.
On the remote islands, you probably won't be able to pay with a credit card, but probably with British and American currency. Ask the owners in advance about how you can pay.
Exchange your money again before you leave the islands, because Falkland currency is very difficult to exchange outside of the islands.
Montevideo is below the equator, so if it is summer there, it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months, temperatures of over +30°C are not uncommon.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature almost never drops below zero, but the wind in combination with the humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
The level of rainfall remains approximately the same throughout the year, without recognizable 'wet' and 'dry' periods.
Many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, but wild animals are still wild animals, so they should not be fed or disturbed.
Keep at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves in the park, and 25 meters from all other wild animals.
Elk, bison, reindeer, bears and pretty much all other large animals can attack you, no matter how tame they seem.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep a safe distance. These animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Additionally, you should be aware that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid wearing or cooking scented foods and keep your campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia and the city with almost 40,000 inhabitants is located on the island of Upolu.
Around the year 1850, Apia was founded and it has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, seven ships from Germany, the US and Great Britain refused to leave the port. This later became known as the infamous standoff.
With the exception of a British battleship, all ships were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the independence struggle by the Mau movement, the highest leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, died in a violent meeting that got out of hand in the city.
There are many beaches, especially because of Auckland's two harbours. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches in the North Harbour district stretch from north to south along the Pacific Ocean, from Long Bay to Devonport.
These are almost all sandy beaches where it is safe to swim and most have pohutukawa trees that provide shade.
At Waitemata's harbour, in the luxurious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, located in Central Auckland, you will find the Tamaki Drive beaches.
These family beaches are sometimes very busy and have a good range of shops on the coast. Swimming is not unsafe.
'Number One' is the most important local beer, which is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called 'Manta'.
There are many French wines to be found, but the New Zealand and Australian wines are perhaps better suited for travel.
The local drinking water can be safely drunk, but bottled water is also easily found if you don't trust it.
A 'flat white' is a strange concept for Australians. Black coffee is 'espresso', cappuccino has a lot of coffee milk (without foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian quality. Fruit juices are expensive, but great.
Trips to the reef take place throughout the year and injuries resulting from these trips to the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, seek expert advice and follow all signs and safety warnings.
Cubomedusae are found from October to April near beaches and river mouths north of Town of 1770. Sometimes they are also found outside this period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. The majority of sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
The main habitat of saltwater crocodiles is in the river mouths north of Rockhampton and they do not normally live in the ocean.
Pre-booking provides peace of mind for the traveller, knowing that they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have deals with certain hotels, although you can usually book other types of accommodation, such as a campsite, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages with breakfast and transport to and from the airport, and sometimes even packages with flight and hotel.
They can also hold your reservation if you want to think about the offer for a little longer or if you need to obtain documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, if you have a request or want to make a change, you should do this through the travel agency rather than the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of attendees at music festivals choose to camp on site, and most visitors consider this to be an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to be early to secure a camping spot near the music.
And remember the following: even when the music on the main stages is over, music may be played on other parts of the festival grounds until late at night.
For families with young children, some festivals have special camping areas.
Be careful where your cabin is located when crossing the Baltic Sea in the winter, because the journey through the ice makes a huge noise if you are too close.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time to explore the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos are generally committed to making the most of the time and money that guests spend. Windows and clocks are usually not present and the exit is sometimes difficult to find.
They normally have special offers on food, drink and entertainment to keep them in a good mood and to prevent them from leaving.
Some locations offer free alcoholic drinks, but when people are drunk, it affects their judgment, and all seasoned gamblers know that it is extremely important to stay sober.
If you go up into the mountains or drive over mountain passes, you have to take into account that there may be snow or ice and the temperature can be extremely low.
On icy and snowy roads there is little friction and it drives differently than on asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to cause you to get stuck.
Visibility can also be obstructed by falling or blowing snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries and do not hinder traffic.
The biggest tourist attraction in Africa are safaris, which for many visitors are the highlight of their trip.
The term safari refers in popular usage to travel over land to view the beautiful African wildlife, particularly on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars and a standard equipment makes a good view possible.
If you want to see lions, cheetahs and leopards, you need a pair of binoculars. Otherwise, the chances are slim that you will see them.
A walking safari (also called a 'forest walk' or 'walking safari') involves walking for several hours or days in a row.
The Paralympics are from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be played at other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Olympic Games twice. The first time was in 1964.
If you have already booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies are no longer valid until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000. Normal tickets will cost around ¥7,000.
You can dry damp clothes by ironing them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available. You can often borrow these items, even if they are not in the room.
If there is no iron available or if you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can also use a hair dryer, if available.
Make sure the fabric is not too hot (this can cause the fabric to shrink or, in extreme cases, scorch).
You can purify water in different ways. Some ways are effective in countering specific risks.
In some areas it is sufficient to boil water for a minute, in other areas water must be boiled for several minutes.
Not every filter is equally effective. In case of doubt, it is best to drink water from a sealed bottle from a reliable company.
Travellers may encounter animal pests that do not exist in their own country.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Normally, infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that injure or kill people with violence, are not considered pests.
Tax-free shopping means that you can buy goods at certain locations that are exempt from taxes and duties.
Travelers going to countries with high excise taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money when it comes to products like alcohol and tobacco.
Point Marion and Fairmont are connected via the highway from Buffalo to Pittsburgh, you often drive through deserted backcountry and that makes this route one big challenge.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your head up. You will encounter many steep slopes, narrow streets and sharp bends.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and adjacent areas — usually around 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and it's even more important to stick to them here than elsewhere.
Surprisingly, you have much better coverage here than in other corners of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries taste great and in Bavaria the pastries are quite rich and varied, just like the pastries of the southern neighbor, Austria.
You see a lot of fruit pastries. All year round, the pastries contain apples, and in the summer months also cherries and plums.
Many popular German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts, and taste great with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a few small but mighty pastries, try some that are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen in the region.
To make a curry, you need spicy and pungent ingredients, combined with vegetables or meat.
Depending on the amount of liquid, a curry can be 'dry' or 'wet'.
In the interior of North India and also in Pakistan, yoghurt is often used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
Indonesian cuisine encompasses dishes from 17,000 islands and is an umbrella term for a variety of regional cuisines from across the country.
But without additional information, the term refers to food that originally comes from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine is now available throughout the archipelago and offers various simple spiced dishes. The most common Javanese seasonings are nuts, peppers, sugar (mainly Javanese coconut sugar) and various fragrant herbs.
Stirrups support the rider's feet and hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide the driver with more stability, but can also bring safety problems with them because the driver's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged along with the horse. To reduce the risk, a number of safety measures have been taken.
Most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety straps. This means that a stirrup leather can come loose from the saddle if it is pulled back when a rider falls off a horse.
Cochamó Valley - This is Chile's most popular climbing destination. It is known as the Yosemite of South America, and has many different large granite walls and rocks.
The mountain peaks offer breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes on the rock walls, which seem to have endless potential.
Winter sports that involve descending, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular. You slide down a snow-covered slope with skis or a snowboard on your feet.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes referred to as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations around skiing at a particular location.
Skiing has been around for a very long time: there are cave paintings of skiers dating back to 5000 BC!
The beginning of skiing dates back to at least the 17th century and in 1861, the first recreational ski resort in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Backpacking with skis: this activity is also called off-piste skiing, skitouring or skihiking.
It's not exactly the same, but it's like alpine skiing or mountain climbing, which is done a lot on steep terrain. Here you need much sturdier skis and boots.
You can see the ski route as a hiking route.
In good conditions, you can cover greater distances than walking, but it is rare that you can reach the speed of cross-country skiing on prepared slopes without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, travelers must apply for a visa and undergo passport controls several times when traveling between different countries.
However, the Schengen area functions in this area almost like one country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to undergo passport control again.
If you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that indicates which produced items are antiques. Some tax offices give the definition of antique to goods that are older than 100 years.
The definition can vary per location. In North America, for example, the age limit is lower than in Europe.
It is possible to label handmade products as antiques, even though they are newer than comparable mass-produced products.
Among the Sámi, reindeer husbandry is an important form of livelihood. The culture surrounding trade is also very important for many with other professions.
Even so, not all Sámi were traditionally involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry. They made a living from fishing, hunting and similar activities. In this context, reindeer were usually used as pack animals.
Many Sámi people work in modern professions today. In Sápmi, the Sámi area, tourism is an important source of income.
The word 'gypsy' is mainly used by non-Roma, but it is also often considered offensive because of the associations with negative stereotypes and incorrect perceptions of the Roma.
If there is a travel advice for the country you want to go to, this can have consequences for your travel health insurance or your cancellation insurance.
In addition to the advice of your own government, you can also consult the advice of other governments. However, their advice is aimed at their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Advisories only include a brief summary of the political situation in a single country.
They often provide a superficial, general and extremely simplistic view compared to other, more detailed sources.
Extreme weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can lead to damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur all over the world. There are different types of weather conditions, which vary based on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Examples of the phenomena and consequences of severe weather include strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall and forest fires, but also thunderstorms, tornadoes, flash floods and hurricanes.
Snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms are examples of regional and seasonal extreme weather phenomena.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks that severe weather conditions in their surroundings entail, as these can also affect some travel plans.
Anyone who wants to visit a country considered a war zone should be professionally trained.
A search on the internet for 'course in hostile environments' is likely to yield the address of a local company.
In a course, all the issues set out here are normally dealt with in more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course normally lasts 2 to 5 days and consists of role-playing, a lot of first aid and occasional weapons training.
There are many books and magazines with articles about survival in the wilderness, but there are few publications about war zones.
Travellers who have planned a gender operation abroad should ensure that they have the correct documentation for the return journey.
It varies greatly whether governments want to issue passports that do not mention gender (X), or to amend a name or gender on documents.
There is just as much difference in the willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents.
Searches at security checks have also become much more extensive since September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery can assume that they will not come out of this scan with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves that break on a reef or something similar and flow onto the beach.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is located in some deeper parts, where a fast flow towards deep water can occur.
Most of the deaths occur due to exhaustion as they try to swim against the current, which could be impossible.
When you have escaped from the strong current, swimming back is a breeze.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be grabbed again. Depending on your skills and whether you have been noticed, you can also wait for help.
The shock of returning is worse than the culture shock (you have a lesser 'honeymoon feeling'), it lasts longer, and it can be more intense.
Travellers who adapt easily to new cultures sometimes have trouble adapting back to their own culture.
If you have lived abroad and then returned, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of the habits of your own culture.
In the past, when you went abroad, you noticed that people were patient and understanding. They understood that travelers had to adapt to a new country.
Usually, patience and understanding are not expected from travellers returning home.
For children, the pyramid show with light and sound is one of the most interesting activities in the area.
You see the pyramids in the dark and you see them in all their silence before the show begins.
Often, the sound of vendors and tourists is always audible here. The story of light and sound is like that of a book.
The Sphinx forms the background and is the narrator of a long story.
The scenes appear as a projection on the pyramids and the rest of the pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819 and have since been claimed by various countries. They have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others are Livingston Island, and Deception. Here you will find the flooded crater of an active volcano that serves as a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth is located on the southern side of the peninsula, near the border with the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula give way to the plateau, after which they reappear to form the 360 km long Mount Ellsworth mountain range, which is crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, also known as the Sentinel Range, includes the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson massif. Mount Vinson is the highest mountain at 4892 meters.
A satellite phone can be your only option in remote locations where there is no mobile phone reception.
A satellite phone is not really a replacement for a mobile phone, since you have to be outside with a clear view of the satellite to be able to make a phone call.
This service is often used by shipping, including pleasure craft, and for expeditions where external data and communication is required.
Your local phone provider can give you more information on how to connect to this service.
It is becoming increasingly popular for people who plan a gap year to travel and learn.
School leavers in particular make use of this to take a gap year before university without any adverse consequences for their education.
Often, enrolling in a course abroad during a gap year can increase your chances of pursuing higher education in your own country.
Normally, tuition fees must be paid for enrollment in these educational programs.
Finland is a fantastic destination for boating. The 'Land of a Thousand Lakes' also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the archipelagos off the coast.
A yacht is not necessary for the archipelagos or lakes.
The archipelagos off the coast and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, but with smaller boats or even a kayak, you get a completely different experience.
In Finland, so many people sail in their free time that the ratio of boats to people is one to seven or eight.
The figure is equal to the figure for Norway, Sweden and New Zealand. Furthermore, it is quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises include an extended stay in Saint Petersburg (Russia).
This way you can spend a few full days in the historic place and spend the night on the ship.
Since 2009, you do not need a separate visa if you only go ashore during a boat excursion.
Some cruises include a visit to the German capital Berlin, but as you can see on the map, Berlin is not close to the sea. A visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be scary for people of all backgrounds and ages, especially if they have never flown before or if they have had a traumatic experience.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's no different than many fears that other people have as well.
If you know how planes work, this can help to alleviate a fear that arises from the unknown or from the fact that you have no control over the plane.
Courier companies receive a generous fee to deliver items quickly. For business documents, merchandise or spare parts for a necessary repair, time often plays a very important role.
Larger companies could use their own planes for certain routes, but it was more difficult for other routes and smaller companies.
If they send things by air, it can take days on some routes before they are unloaded and cleared through customs.
Only checked-in luggage could be processed faster. According to the rules of airlines, there must be a corresponding passenger, and that is you.
The most obvious way to fly in first or business class is to pay for this privilege with a wad of cash (or better still, have your employer do it).
However, this is not cheap: the rule of thumb is that you pay about four times economy class for business, and about eleven times for first class.
It is generally not worth looking for discounts for business class or first class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know all too well that there is a group of flyers who are willing to pay a lot of money to fly somewhere quickly and comfortably, and the companies charge corresponding fees for this.
Chişinău is the Moldavian capital. Here, the Romanian language is mainly spoken, but the Russian language is also very common.
As a multi-ethnic republic, Moldova suffered from an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova. This republic has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by the members of the UN.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in Moldova.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with about 3.7 million inhabitants, the largest port after Istanbul and a good transport hub.
The once ancient city of İzmir is now a modern, developed and busy commercial center on a bay and is surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, the glass buildings and modern shopping centres covered with red roof tiles, the 18th-century markets, the old mosques and churches, but still the city feels more like a Mediterranean, European city than a traditional Turkish one.
In the village of Haldarsvík, you can enjoy views of the nearby island of Eysturoy, as well as a unique church with eight corners.

Also head north and check out the stunning Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (a temple complex), where internationally renowned Marian apparitions have taken place.
Remember that you are actually just visiting a mass grave, but also a place that has an almost immeasurable significance for a large part of the world population.
Many men and women who survived their time here are still alive and many of them have loved ones who were murdered there or worked themselves to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Show all appropriate respect, solemnity, and dignity during your visit. Do not trivialise the Holocaust or Nazism.

The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority can understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most signs are in Catalan, because according to the law, that is the first official language.
Spanish is widely spoken in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are made by an automated system in several languages, including French, Arabic, Spanish, English and also Japanese.
The inhabitants of Paris are known to be selfish, rude and arrogant.
Although this is usually just an incorrect stereotype, it can't hurt to put your best foot forward in Paris and behave like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will make it a lot easier to explore Paris.
The hard exterior of the Parisians quickly disappears when you show that you are familiar with their way of doing things.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested and this forested area consists mainly of beech, spruce and pine trees, and includes a combination of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
There are a particularly large number of different plant communities, due to the different microclimates, the different types of soil and the varying differences in altitude.
This area is also the habitat of a very wide range of animal and bird species.
There are rare animals such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat and the black grouse, in addition to all kinds of more common species.
When women visit a monastery, they are required to wear a skirt that covers their knees and their shoulders must be covered.
Usually, as a woman, you will be given a shawl if you arrive unprepared at a monastery, but if you bring your own, with nice bright colours, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
On the other hand, men must wear trousers that come down to at least the knee.
You can also borrow these from the stock at the entrance, but this clothing is not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing it. One size fits all for men!
Like many other Mediterranean regions, the Mallorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and makes extensive use of olive oil.
A simple and popular dish for dinner, mainly during the summer months, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and whatever is available in terms of condiments, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Proper nouns, like Sie, which means you, always have a capital letter at the beginning, even if they are in the middle of a sentence.
In this way, you make a significant difference between a number of verbs and objects.
It probably also makes reading easier. Nevertheless, writing is more complicated, because you have to figure out whether a verb or an adjective should be used as a noun.
Most Italian words are written exactly as they are pronounced, so pronunciation generally poses few problems.
You have to pay the most attention to the c and the g. The pronunciation of those letters depends on the vowel that follows them.
You also have to pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means sweetheart, while carro means cart.
The Persian language has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Reading this introduction to grammar will already teach you a lot about the grammar of Persian and help you understand sentences.
It is quite logical that if you know a Romance language, it is easier for you to learn Portuguese.
But people who speak a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is so similar that you don't need to learn it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are now outdated, and serve as museums or educational attractions.
Light pollution was not such a big problem back then as it is now, so they were often built in cities or on campuses, more accessible than those of today.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities built in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami is the viewing of cherry blossoms and has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
In China, plum blossoms were the favorite flowers and that is where the concept came from.
The first cherry blossom festivals in Japan were organized by the emperor and were only meant for him and other aristocrats at the imperial court.
Plants look best in a natural setting, so you must resist the urge to remove even 'just one' species.
If you collect samples during a visit to a landscaped garden, you will be denied access to the garden immediately and without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to stay, very easy to navigate and almost everything is available after arrival.
But if you are in the 'high tropics', but a few degrees north of the equator, you experience both heat (always) and strong sun (when the air is clear, which is less common).
There are also some buses heading north to Hebron, the burial site of the Biblical patriarchs Isaac, Jacob, Abraham and their wives.
Make sure the bus you take really goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good holiday destination.
For example, you can visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, book a cruise to the interesting cities along the Danube or take a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also indicate popular walking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
People who do not believe in Christian countries and non-Christians all over the world have also adopted many traditions associated with the holiday.
There is a tradition where you stay up all night on Easter Sunday until you can see the sunrise at some point.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could just as well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
In traditional churches, a Paschal Vigil is often held on the Saturday evening of the Easter weekend, during which the congregations often celebrate the resurrection of Christ at midnight.
All the animals that originally arrived at the islands came here by swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, it was not possible for mammals to make the journey, which is why the giant tortoise became the most common grazing mammal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans set foot on the Galapagos, all kinds of mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
During the winter, the polar night takes place in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, which means that the sun does not actually rise.
There is a good chance you will be able to see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be more or less dark day and night.
The areas are sparsely populated and therefore light pollution is not often a problem. This means that you can also enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese work environment is more structured and formal in nature than in the Western world.
Overalls are standard work clothes and colleagues call each other by their last name or job title.
Unity in the workplace is crucial. The focus is on group performance rather than rewarding individual work performance.
