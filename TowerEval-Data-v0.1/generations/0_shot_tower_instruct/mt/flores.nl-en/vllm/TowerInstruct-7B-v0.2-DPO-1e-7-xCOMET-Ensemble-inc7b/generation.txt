This not only proves the already widespread theory that certain dinosaurs had feathers in any case, but also provides more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional placement.
According to scientists, the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
The researchers concluded that the spine was probably a later evolutionary development, because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, or spine, but do have other features of feathers - such as barbs.
The structure of the feathers seems to indicate that they were not used for flying, but to regulate temperature or for appearance. The researchers suggested that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, but that this monster actually shows adult feathers and therefore not the down of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, despite the fact that it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the monster had the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chick.

The completed work was mainly theoretical in nature, but the program is written for the simulation of observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The team was looking for the effect that would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the universe and that of the Milky Way.
Similar to how the moon exerts force on the earth, leading to tides, the Milky Way exerts force on the Sagittarius star system.
The researchers concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as it affects ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter in a galaxy is located around it, in a kind of ring, and consists of a large number of smaller particles.

XDR-TB (Extremely Drug Resistant Tuberculosis) was discovered by Dr. Tony Moll in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa.
He stated in an interview that the new variant is "very, very worrying and concerning because of the very high mortality rate".
Doctor Moll thinks that some patients have contracted the disease in the hospital, including two healthcare workers from the hospital.

"The thermal behavior of this is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a temperature that is quite constant. What is consistent is that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, there has traditionally been little need for technology to vote: voters go into a booth and put a pre-printed piece of paper into an envelope stating which candidate they are voting for.
Officials first check the voter's identity. Then the voter slides the envelope into the ballot box and then signs the voting roll.
The process is relatively well defined in the electoral law of France.
Ballot boxes have been transparent since 1988, so that both voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are added other than those of registered and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. Volunteers count the votes in the evening under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

Her first was the Slalom, where she received a Did Not Finish on her first run. 36 of the 116 participants received the same result in that race.
In the other race she participated in, the sitting Grand Slalom, she was tenth among the women, with a combined time of 4:41:30. That is 2:11:60 minutes slower than the Austrian winner Claudia Loesch, and 1:09:02 minutes slower than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who finished ninth.
Four skiers from the women's slalom group were unable to finish their runs and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to qualify during the race.
The stolen laptop and mobile phone have been found by the police of Madhya Pradesh.
According to Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya, five of the rapists of the Swedish woman have been arrested and they have found her mobile phone and laptop.
Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar are the suspects.
According to police commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the suspects covered their faces when they appeared in court.
There were three people in the house when the car hit the house, but none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious injuries to the head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services tried to free the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to Great Yarmouth, at the James Paget Hospital.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been sentenced in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court for murdering her son.
She is in custody pending charges and trial, but the eyewitness report may be misleading because her story has been published many times.
This is common practice in the rest of the UK, but justice in Scotland works differently and courts have deemed the publication of photos as possibly detrimental.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that 'journalists are playing a dangerous game when they publish photos etc. of suspects.'
The Crown Office is in overall charge of prosecutions and has told journalists that no further statements will be made, at least until charges are brought.
According to sources, the document refers to a dispute settlement mechanism, something the Palestinians have been keen to establish based on the borders before the Middle East war in 1967.
Other topics discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, a city holy to both peoples, and the problems in the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands that there be a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of an agreement. However, the PA is only willing to agree to a presence for five years.
Shooters in the additional trial for pest control had to be closely monitored by forest rangers. The trial was being followed and its effectiveness was being assessed.
In a collaboration between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director for park conservation and heritage at the NPWS, the four chosen marksmen for the first shooting operation have received extensive safety and training instructions.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a nine-member new provisional electoral council (Provisional Electoral Council of CEP).
This means that Martelly has achieved a CEP five times in the past four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous National Electoral Council. This is part of a package of measures to ensure that new elections are held in the country.
The commission was established by Martelly in response to widespread protests against the government that have taken place since October.
The sometimes violent protests were caused by the failure to hold elections, some of which should have taken place since 2011.
About 60 cases have been reported of defective iPods overheating, leading to six fires and four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of the 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company called "not serious."
'Very regrettable', was the ministry's response to the fact that Apple has delayed the report.
Mariana was hit by the earthquake at 07.19 local time (Friday 21.19 GMT).
The emergency management office of the Northern Mariana Islands stated that no damage has been reported nationwide.
In addition, the National Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no tsunami warning.
In Manila, the Philippine capital, a former Philippine police officer has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been brought to safety and so far at least six fatalities have been confirmed.
Six hostages were released earlier, including the children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers returned in exchange for an older woman who needed to use the toilet. Mendoza was ultimately shot.
Liggins went to work in medicine, following the example of his father.
Trained as a midwife, he started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins conducted research on premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that the maturation of the fetal lungs of babies was accelerated by the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that government researchers found two "black boxes" with flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, 'Luna was the first 'Queen of Extreme'. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons. Just as unique as she was. A strong woman.'
Dustin 'Goldust' Runnels said that 'Luna was just as weird as me... maybe even weirder... I love her and will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place'.
Of the 1,400 people surveyed for the 2010 federal election, the number of people who opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Former Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of the participants in this poll supported this position. They want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
Twenty-nine percent of respondents believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent said it should never happen.
The Olympic gold medal winner swam the 100 and 200 meter freestyle and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but his condition was called into question due to his complaints.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to alleviate his pain because it's banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the currently largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery at the beginning of February using different hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source of water that came to Earth, along with organic material that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to gain insight into how planets are formed. They are particularly interested in how the Earth was formed, given that it has been a very long time since comets collided with the Earth.
Cuomo (53) was inaugurated as governor earlier this year and signed a law last month that legalizes marriages between people of the same sex.
He called the rumors 'political nonsense and gossip'.
It is speculated that he wants to run for president in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow planes to take shorter routes, which could save millions of tons of fuel annually and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike older technologies using ground radars, which allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft much more accurately, and provide pilots with clearer information.
No additional transport will be deployed and no above-ground trains will stop at Wembley; in addition, the parking lots and the P&R are not accessible on the site.
A possible lack of transport increased the likelihood that the match would be played behind closed doors and without supporters.
A study published in the scientific journal Science on Tuesday was about the formation of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved within two generations. It was thought that this process took much longer because the crossing of a native Darwin finch, the Middle Ground Finch, with an immigrated Cactus Finch, the Española Ground Finch, took longer.
Gold can be processed into many forms. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into a narrow wire that can be twisted and braided. It can also be forged or rolled into plates.
After it has been made very thin, it can be pasted onto another metal. It can even be made so thin that it was sometimes used for the decoration of hand-painted illustrations in books that were called 'illuminated manuscripts'.
This is called the pH value of a chemical substance. You can already make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of the cabbage juice then changes based on the acidity (acid to basic or alkaline) of the chemical substance.
The pH value is indicated based on the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance that has been tested.
Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron, and hydrogen ions are protons without electrons.
Mix both dry powders together, wet and clean your hands and make a ball.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjodaro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to an advanced sewage system.
Sewerage remains have been found in houses in the Minoan cities on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
Furthermore, there were already toilets in China, Egypt, and Persia in ancient times. For example, in the Roman era, toilets were often part of a public bathhouse, where both men and women gathered in a mixed group.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
As soon as the space satellite receives the call, it is immediately returned.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and image.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, you need a huge rocket that is more than 30 meters long.
The wheel has changed the world incredibly. The most important thing the wheel has given us is easier and faster transport.
The train, the car, and many other means of transport are the result of this.
There are medium-sized feline predators that eat medium-sized prey, from hares to antelopes and deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (such as feral cats kept as pets) that hunt smaller prey in larger numbers, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their success stems from the idea of a niche, a special job that every cat has, which means they don't compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called troops.
Troops consist of one to three adult males who are related to each other and also have up to thirty females and cubs.
The women are normally closely related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions behaves much like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that surprisingly resemble lions (but not other big cats) and are very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (although not well), swim, jump long distances, and has five times the pulling power of a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger does not roar as loudly as a lion. It is more like he growls a whole sentence.
Ocelots' favourite meal is small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. The ocelot almost exclusively hunts animals that are much smaller than itself.
Scholars suspect that ocelots use their sense of smell to hunt small animals (their prey) by smelling the ground where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision and move very quietly. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes detached from the large population from which they originated (for example, by moving over a mountain range or river, or if they are moved to another island, from which they cannot easily return), they are often in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and enemies, so the new population must adapt or change their approach to be able to compete.
Because they still need the same adjustments as before, the original population has not changed at all.
As the new population began to adapt to the new environment, they also began to look less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different in appearance that you can no longer call them the same species.
This process is called speciation and simply involves the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe in and they absorb carbon dioxide that people exhale.
Through photosynthesis, plants obtain their nutrients from the sun and also provide shade.
Our houses and clothes are made of plants. We mainly eat plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain during that time. It had nothing to fear from anyone except other Mosasauruses.
His long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an extra set in the palate, which means that nothing or no one could escape him.
It is not certain, but it is possible that his tongue was forked. It ate turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and perhaps even its own kind.
Nothing was safe from his attacks in bodies of water; even giant dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex were no match for him.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans also had their share of strange or unusual delicacies, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
In addition, there was another difference; poor people and women sat on chairs while eating, but wealthy men often held banquets where they would lie on their sides while eating.
Meals from Roman times do not contain food that came from America or Asia to Europe in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa. Furthermore, not a single ancient Roman ever ate a turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for all their gods. This temple was seen as the god's own home.
Offerings were made to the gods and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods by organizing ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had a public courtyard and a back room that was only accessible to priests.
Sometimes, towers in the shape of pyramids were built as part of the temples, called ziggoerattes.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
Houses were not of great importance in the warm climate of the Middle East.
The daily life of the Hebrew family often took place outside.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were no more than a counter along the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland had few inhabitants. According to Norse legends, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, found Greenland on his way west, and gave it its name.
He made this discovery, but there were already Eskimo tribes living there at that time.
Although they were all 'Scandinavian' countries, the people, the royal family, customs and history of Sweden, Iceland, Denmark and Norway were very different from each other.
After watching the movie National Treasure, you might think that there is a treasure map behind the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is a misconception. There is something written on the back, but it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the American Declaration of Independence, the words 'Original American Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776' are written. The text is upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is certain that the large parchment (29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was once rolled up for storage.
It therefore appears that the designation was simply added as a kind of label.
Thanks to the D-Day landings and the fighting that followed, the north of France was liberated. However, the south remained occupied.
It was ruled by Vichy France. These were French people who sided with the Germans in 1940 and therefore collaborated with the enemy instead of fighting against them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France with Operation Dragoon.
The Americans and the Free French had liberated southern France within just two weeks. After that, they set off for Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together in a society.
The term civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civilian, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state; and this also defines the format of society in a certain way.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilization with a culture suggests that knowledge is passed down through multiple generations, leaving a lasting cultural footprint and balanced distribution.
When minority cultures disappear, they often leave no relevant historical evidence behind, so they are not officially recognized as civilizations.
During the revolution, thirteen states formed a weak central government under the articles of the Confederation, consisting only of a congress.
The congress lacked the power to levy taxes because there was no national executive or judicial authority and it relied on state authorities to implement all decisions, which often did not want to cooperate.
It also did not have the authority to ignore tax laws and rates between states.
All states had to unanimously agree to the articles before they could be amended, but the states did not take the national government seriously, which meant that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, after the German team, and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are extremely popular, especially in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan consists of almost 7,000 islands (with Honshu being the largest island). As a result, Japan is the 7th largest island in the world.
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is often referred to as a 'peninsula' geographically
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century, when sailors from Europe sailed along the island and gave it the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch VOC established itself in the southwest of Taiwan as a base, where the VOC tackled the native grain production processes and employed Chinese workers on rice and sugar plantations.
In the year 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan were conquered by troops from the Qing dynasty (1644-1912), after which Taiwan was annexed as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, which transferred sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Composed of three large structures, Machu Picchu consists of Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt so that tourists get a better idea of what they used to look like.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored. The renovation is still ongoing.
For example, the most common photo format for still images worldwide is 35 mm, which was the usual film format at the end of the analogue film era.
These are still produced today, although it is mainly the ratio of the image that was adopted by the image sensor of the digital camera.
Strangely enough, 35 mm film is actually 36 mm wide, with a height of 24 mm.
The aspect ratio of this size (divide by twelve to get the simplest ratio of integers) would be 3:2 in this case.
Many common formats (such as APS-like formats) are equal to or a close approximation of this aspect ratio.
The third-party rule, which is often abused and ridiculed by many, is a simple guideline that makes the image dynamic, yet also easy to understand.
The most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines. This divides the image vertically and horizontally into three parts (see example).
During this period in Europe's history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church came under fire.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united European states, despite differences in language and customs.
From the king to the ordinary citizen, his pervasive power influenced everyone.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to combat suffering and poverty, and the church has resources for this reason.
The church had been the central authority in Rome for over a thousand years, and this relationship of power and money led many people to start doubting whether this principle was being followed.
Great Britain established a blockade at sea against Germany, just after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy proved effective, as it was no longer possible to provide vital supplies to soldiers and civilians. However, this blockade violated the generally accepted international law that has been established in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Great Britain has placed mines in international waters, so that ships could no longer sail in entire parts of the ocean, which was even dangerous for neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to the country's unrestrained submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations had a pacifist and isolationist attitude.
After the First World War, states wanted to prevent such horrors from ever happening again.
Tesla emigrated to the United States of America in 1884 to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
When he came to the United States, he had only 4 cents, a collection of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous boss) for Thomas Edison with him.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each phase of China or each ruling family had a distinct dynasty.
There was also an unstable period between the different dynasties in which the provinces were divided. The most well-known was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which took place in the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
At that time, fierce wars took place between various nobles who were fighting for the throne.
In the history of ancient China, the era of the Three Kingdoms is known as one of the bloodiest. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest position in the grand palace in Xi'an.
The Revolution had major social and political consequences, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolute monarchy to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to its inhabitants rather than a single leader.
After the revolution, positions were available for all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and suitable candidates could succeed.
The same applies to the army. Army ranks are no longer based on someone's class but on the person's caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working class in other countries to revolt.
Muhammad was intensely involved with celestial matters. He often went to a cave for reflection, which later became known as the Cave of Hira in the Mountains of Noer.
The cave itself, which has withstood the test of time, gives a very vivid picture of the spirituality of Muhammad.
The cave is located on one of the mountain peaks on the north side of Mecca and is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
Even if it was known that the cave existed, it was not easy to find at all. Once inside the cave, there is complete isolation.
The only thing you can see is the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. There is very little of this world to see or hear from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still stands.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC and is one of the countless large pyramid structures in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or 'Pyramids of Giza' in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, a number of temples and the great sphinx.
The large pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu. Many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built as a tribute to Khufu's wives and family members.
The up-bow sign looks like a V and the down-bow sign looks like a dot or a square with the bottom missing.
Above means you should start at the tip and push the bow away. Below means you should start at the bowstring (the place where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bowstring.
An upward movement usually produces a softer sound, while a downward movement produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
Take the freedom to sketch your personal marks, but don't forget that the printed chord symbols are there for a musical reason, so they usually have to be respected.
A group of market women sat behind the departure of the terrified Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Therese, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They drove back to the French capital in a carriage, surrounded by jeering and threatening mobs that threatened the royal couple.
The actions of the crowd forced the king and queen to fully open the windows of their carriage.
At one point, someone in the crowd held up the head of a royal guard who had been murdered in Versailles in front of the eyes of a terrified queen.
The war costs of US imperialism in relation to the conquest of the Philippines have been paid by the people of the Philippines.
They were imposed on the American colonial regime to pay taxes to finance a large part of the costs, and the interest on bonds was spent through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government.
American imperialism was largely based on the enormous profits of the long-term exploitation of the Philippines.
To understand the Templars, one must know what the context was that gave rise to the order.
The era in which this occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
After the early Middle Ages came the high Middle Ages, which were followed by the late Middle Ages, which usually ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term for a wide range of ideas in practice: from technological offerings or the technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and its appearance in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have these two general views: the development of technology follows a trajectory that largely extends beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, some will say that the arrival of the car automatically leads to the construction of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically feasible for just a few cars. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to more accidents on the road, which leads to the development of new healthcare technologies to help the human body recover.
In romanticism, a large part of cultural determinism was included, which came from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In Romanticism, geography formed the individual and over time, habits and cultures emerged as a result of this geography. These formed a harmonious society and were better than the arbitrary laws imposed on them.
Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe, just as Paris is the current fashion capital.
It was known as an epicenter of luxury from around 400 AD to around 1100 AD.
The status of the empire declined in the 12th century, mainly because the crusaders returned with silk and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
Around this time, Paris also took over the title of fashion capital from Constantinople.
Gothic architecture reached its heyday in the 10th, 11th and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture from the east.
However, due to the slow communication channels, styles in the west were 25 to 30 years behind.
At the end of the Middle Ages, a distinct style began to emerge in Western Europe. One of the biggest developments was the result of the Crusades: people started using knots to fasten their clothing.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture that produces enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Agriculture aimed at subsistence is a simple system that is usually organic. It uses stored seed that comes from the ecoregion, combined with rotational crops or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
In the past, most farmers worked in subsistence agriculture. This is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by societal norms, giving them the opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, social class, location, and/or gender of their members.
A subculture can be defined by the following types of qualities: linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of one or more of these factors.
Members of a subculture often show which group they belong to through a certain symbolic style in what they wear, in how they behave and the jargon they speak.
One of the most commonly used methods for illustrating the importance of socialization was the unfortunate case of a few children who, due to neglect, hardships, or intentional abuse during their upbringing, were not socialized by adults.
They are called 'wolf children' or 'wild children'. Some wolf children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); sometimes this child was abandoned, because the parents did not want to accept the serious mental or physical disability of the child.
Troublesome children may have experienced serious child abuse or serious trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived in the wilderness alone.
A feral child who has not been raised by humans may exhibit behavior that resembles the behavior of the animal that cared for the child (within physical limits), such as fear of or indifference towards humans.
Learning on a project basis should simplify and make education more interesting, but scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a tool to support individuals who are dealing with a new learning experience, for example a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real. A teacher is, for example, a form of support, but the paperclip man from Microsoft Office is too.
There is virtual scaffolding built into the software that asks questions, provides memory aids, and explains procedures that may be difficult for students to understand without help.
There are various reasons why children end up in foster care, such as neglect, abuse, and exploitation.
No child should have to grow up in an environment where they are not well cared for, where they are not loved, and where they cannot develop, but this happens.
We consider the foster care system to be a safe zone for these children.
The aim is for foster care to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
In foster care, all needs that were neglected in the previous home must be met.
On the internet, elements of interpersonal and mass communication are combined.
The different characters of the internet lead to new dimensions in the application of the Uses & Gratifications theory.
'Learning' and 'socialisation', for example, are presented as important reasons for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) introduced new motivation aspects such as 'personal involvement' and 'ongoing relationships' when they examined public reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to remarkable discoveries in interpreting micro-expressions, which are facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
It is particularly stated that no one can recognize a lie by paying attention to micro-expressions alone.
In his essay The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks described how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess its sincerity.
He even suggested that other species of animals, such as domestic dogs, also have the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variants: hidden and visible.
Mutation adds new genetic variation; selection eliminates this variation from the pool of expressed variation.
For each generation, variation is achieved through separation and recombination between the two groups.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans can survive in the savannah, but it has difficulty obtaining the necessary amino acids from the plant sources available there.
Failure to comply can also have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The easiest plant sources to find are the proteins in leaves and legumes, but unless they are cooked, they are difficult to digest for primates like us.
Not only is animal food (ants, termites, eggs) easily digestible, but it also contains a lot of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their 'protein problem' in the same way that chimpanzees in the savannah solve this problem today.
Sleep interruption means that you wake up for a reason during your normal sleep period and fall asleep again within a short time (10–60 minutes).
This is fairly easy by using a relatively soft alarm clock that brings you back to consciousness without immediately waking you up completely.
If you want to turn off your clock while you sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room. This way, you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on the biorhythm are, for example, drinking a lot of liquid before going to bed (and especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic). This means you will have to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner calm a person has is in contrast to the amount of stress a person carries in their body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive the vitality present. Every person is capable of achieving satisfaction and total peace.
Anyone can enlighten their mind. Only your own stress and negativity stand in the way of this goal.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but this form of Buddhism has been expanded with the Mahayana path of love and with a large number of techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism consists of a relatively simple core of kundalini yoga, meditation, and following universal love.
Through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualized images, the energy of Kundalini yoga (enlightenment energy) is awakened.
The core of Tibetan meditation is yoga with a deity as the focus. Using the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and consciousness is brought into an enlightened state.
Because Germany was a common enemy in World War II, cooperation between the USSR and the US was established. When the war ended, conflicts between the system, process, and culture led to the countries quarrelling with each other.
The former allies were on opposite sides two years after the end of the war, this was the beginning of the Cold War.
The war would last 40 years and there were battles with proxy armies on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
The Polish defensive forces held out until September 17, 1939, after which they had to retreat and reorganize along the bridgehead in Romania.
However, these plans were overturned in one night when 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded and formed the Latvian and Ukrainian fronts, after occupying the eastern parts of Poland. This was in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international peace treaties that were both bilateral and multilateral.
Shipping goods by ship is the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, it is the task of the navy to ensure that a country retains the ability to transport people and goods, while the ability of the enemy to transport people and goods is hindered.
The US tried to get troops and equipment across the Atlantic to the British, and this North Atlantic campaign of WWII is one of the most notable recent examples.
The German navy tried to stop this traffic at the same time, using mainly U-boats.
Like the rest of Europe, Great Britain would probably have fallen into German hands if the Allies had failed.
It seems that the goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
In ancient times, cultures and tribes began to keep them so that they could always easily get their hair, meat, milk, and hides.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds on a hill or other grazing area, guarded by goat herders, often a child or younger person, just like the more well-known sheep herder. Today, they are still guarded in the same way.
Horse-drawn railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although horse-drawn railways consisted of a track made of planks, the horses had to run faster and pull larger amounts than on the somewhat difficult roads of that time.
Crossbars were used quite early on to keep the rails in place, but gradually it was realised that rails would be more efficient if there was an iron point on the top.
This quickly became the common practice, but the iron resulted in more wear and tear on the wooden carriage wheels.
Iron wheels eventually replaced the wooden variants. In 1767, the first completely iron rails were laid.
The first form of transport we know is walking. People started walking upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus appeared (which means upright man).
Their predecessor, the Australopithecus, walked upright less often.
Bipedal specializations are found in fossils of the Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago. The Sahelanthropus may have also been walking on two legs seven million years ago.
We can live in a more environmentally friendly way, join an environmental movement, or even take action to alleviate future suffering.
In many cases, it is just like symptomatic treatment. But if we want more than a temporary solution, we need to identify the cause of the problems and eliminate it.
The scientific and technological developments of human society have undoubtedly changed the earth profoundly. Moreover, overpopulation and the extravagant human lifestyle have exacerbated the problems.
After the Declaration of Independence was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap a few blocks away. This draft was signed by the President of the Continental Congress John Hancock and Minister Charles Thomson.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, which are now better known as 'Dunlap broadsides'.
John Nixon gave the public reading of the document for the first time on July 8 in the garden of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6 and read to his troops in New York on July 9. Another copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists believe that a species of dinosaur still exists today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them to be dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still make them seem like dinosaurs.
They have claws and scales on their feet, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs, just like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Manipulating data encoded in binary digits forms the basis for almost all computers used today.
A binary number can only have two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits (and in computer language 'bits').
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms such as vomiting are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The presence of open boxes of medication or toxic household chemicals is the best indication of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
This group of insects is formally called 'true bugs' by entomologists.
This term comes from an ancient agreement with bed bugs, which are insects that can parasitize humans very well.
Both bed bugs and cockroaches are nest-bound, they have adapted to live in their host's nest or home.
In the US, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological condition in adults of both younger and middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spine, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or that of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to give up their baby for adoption.
In an adoption, the parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
Discovering how the world works through the scientific method is the most important goal of science. This method is the guideline for most scientific research.
However, it is about more than just experiments; an experiment is a test to rule out one or more potential assumptions, to raise questions and to make observations, as a guide for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and in particular the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on science, including psychology, were accepted.
The West understood Greek philosophy and science less and less as knowledge of Greek declined.
In physiological and behavioral observations of rhythms, there is often a strong dependence on endogenous processes and production via the biological clock.
Most creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, live according to periodic rhythms. These are not just responses to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that go through a cycle for a certain period of time, even if there are no external signals for them.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the most important indications that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were carried out. In one experiment, the DNA in the phage was labelled with radioactive phosphorus, and in the other experiment, the protein of the phage was labelled with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type, the importance of the genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells are hereditary. Other mutations can cause cells to die or can lead to cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who like to visit natural areas because they want to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
On site, one can hunt, fish, take photos, observe birds, go to parks, and study the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people from small villages drive to their workplaces and pass people whose workplaces are located in the village they come from.
Everyone in this dynamic transport shuttle is in some way connected to and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science shows that this enormous carbon economy has caused the biosphere to no longer be in the stable state that allowed human evolution to occur over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems, and almost everyone complains about them.
In developed countries, problems with water quality or collapsing bridges are rarely seen.
Why do so many complaints arise in transport systems, why does it go wrong on a daily basis? Are transport technicians simply incompetent, or is it something more fundamental?
In traffic flow, the focus is on the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between the individuals.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave in a reasonably predictable manner, which means that traffic flows show some degree of consistency and that there is something to be said about this in mathematical terms.
Links have been established between the three core characteristics in order to better represent traffic flow: (1) intensity, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships make it easier to plan, design and operate road engineering facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Thanks to their ability to fly, they could more easily escape from enemies and find food and mating partners more efficiently.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along their body.
This allows them to hide in a greater number of small places from predators.
At the moment, only dragonflies and mayflies cannot fold their wings.
A few thousand years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
There were people who thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system moved around the Earth, and the Sun as well (and other stars).
This sounds fairly logical, because you don't feel that the earth is moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the world's largest and second-longest river and carries more than 8 times as much water as the second-largest.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, with a width of six miles in some places.
At least 20% of all the water that flows into the sea via the rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. The water comes from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remain unsurpassed in terms of size and technical excellence of the construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom admired the monument of their predecessors, which was already more than a thousand years old at that time.
There are approximately 800 inhabitants living in Vatican City. This is the smallest independent country in the entire world and also the country with the lowest population.
Italian is the official language for the communication and laws of Vatican City.
Italian is the language most spoken by the people who work there, while Latin is used a lot during religious ceremonies.
Everyone who lives in Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People have known the most basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, since ancient times, because they are all found in nature and it is relatively easy to extract them with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle speculated that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This seemed more like what we know of the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also theorized that they transition into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are, quite simply, a combination of at least two metals. As you probably know, the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
Alloys can also contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, for example carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter consists of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a trillion atoms would fit at the end of this sentence.
That's why the pencil was a faithful friend to many people when it was launched.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods have emerged, the pen has been demoted in status and is used much less.
Nowadays, people write messages on a computer screen without ever needing a pencil sharpener.
You might wonder what will happen to the keyboard once something new comes onto the market.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it costs energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. When the core is split again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means that they fall apart at the slightest provocation.
The surface of the moon is characterized by dust and rock. The crust is the outer layer of the moon.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick at its closest point and 100 km thick at its farthest point.
The crust is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more mares on the side, because the crust is thinner there, making it easier for lava to reach the surface.
Content theories are aimed at discovering what motivates people and what appeals to them.
This theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they grow up.
With these theories, they want to explore the reasons why certain people want certain things and which environmental factors influence them to do certain things or not.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's motivation-hygiene theory.
In general, two types of management styles emerge when managers take charge of their former colleagues. In one style, they try to present themselves as equals.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions and take disciplinary measures, conduct evaluation discussions, delegate tasks, and hold people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, this person transforms into an unrecognizable individual. He or she feels the need to change everything the team has done so far and wants to take ownership of everything.
In the end, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
Often, this behavior leads to a gap between the leaders and the team members.
Virtual teams must meet the same standards of excellence as normal teams, although there are some small differences.
In most cases, virtual team members are the first point of contact for their direct physical group.
They are often more independent than traditional team members, because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The idea of a truly 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, pp 109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to whom each member reports. The invisible team also sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organization want to start the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One of the goals of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and resourcefulness come to light when all available resources are effectively deployed within the functional departments of an organization.
The result of this is that the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
To enable innovation in an organization, management must foster a culture in which innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning are central.
According to Angel (2006), organizations can perform better with an approach based on the continuum model.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to studying cognition, allowing the research area to be narrowed and more accurate data to be collected.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain damage, trauma, wounds, and tumors can influence behavior and lead to changes in mental capacity.
As there are more and more new technologies, we are learning more and more about the structures and processes in the brain.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to develop simulation models that give us a better understanding of the processes of our mind.
AI immediately brings to mind science fiction for most people, but it is also an essential part of computer science. It is used in research on machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Developing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior is part of research into AI.
Some examples include management, planning, the ability to diagnose and answer customer questions, and recognition of handwriting, voice, and face.
These have become separate disciplines for finding solutions to problems in real life.
Today, this system for artificial intelligence is widely used in economic, medical, technical, and military fields, such as in various software applications for PCs and video games.
Many excursions are planned for each class. Often, a teacher would take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Thanks to technological developments, virtual excursions are now possible. This allows students to view the artifacts in a museum from their classroom, take a peek inside an aquarium, or see beautiful works of art.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a fantastic way to look back on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, which is redesigned every year and whose previous versions are preserved online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. Often, their grammar and spelling are poor at first, but this changes quickly because they have an audience.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
By blogging, 'students are also forced to learn more about the world around them'. The need to keep the audience interested inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning well beyond the traditional school day.
When used properly, blogs can help students develop analytical skills and critical thinking; by actively engaging in discussion on the internet, students can find their own place in the context of others' material and at the same time determine their own position on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
The bilingual capital of Canada is the charming Ottawa, full of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and future.
Further south you will find the Niagara Falls. In the north you will find the beautiful unspoiled Muskoka and much more.
These kinds of things make Ontario typical Canadian in the eyes of outsiders.
Further north, large areas are sparsely populated and some of these areas are even virtually uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that will surprise many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than the total population of Canada.
The East African islands are located along the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and in terms of fauna it is almost a separate continent.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent countries or are connected to France and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought the Islamic faith with them, which then spread widely across the Comoros and Mayotte.
The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India, which marked the beginning of European influence and colonization in the 15th century.
The region is bordered to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean and to the north by the Sahel region.
Women: female travelers are advised to say they are married, whether or not that is true.
It also helps to put on rings (not too expensive-looking rings).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to behaviour that they find intimidating and that it is common to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be clear when you reject a man and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences don't work well here!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen. The city was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids and was known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the harbor and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca. After an earthquake in 1755, they left the city again.
The sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and named it Daru l-Bayad. The Spanish traders who established their trading base here gave it the name Casablanca.
In Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
Around the old Medina, you will find many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan items, such as tagines, pots, leather products, water pipes, and other trinkets, but it is purely aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The city is located near Rwanda, in the far east.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed when the Nyiragongo volcano spewed lava, burying most of the city's streets, particularly the city center.
Although Goma itself is relatively safe, you should check the situation regarding the fighting that is going on in the province of North Kivu before visiting areas outside of Goma.
In addition, the city serves as a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and you can find some of the most affordable trips for mountain gorilla tracking in Africa there.
You can get around Goma by boda-boda (a motorcycle taxi). The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese Francs for the short ride.
'Timbuktu' is relatively poorly accessible and is therefore now used as a metaphor for exotic, distant countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a rundown city, but its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered world heritage sites due to desert storms.
It was one of the most important stops on the PBS exhibition Special Wonders from the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city differs from the other cities in the country because it has a more Arabic appearance than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and runs east along the border with Mozambique, north along the border with Zimbabwe, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park is 19,500 square kilometres in size, divided into 14 different eco-zones, where various wild animal species are kept.
As a major attraction in South Africa, this park is the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily conservation fees and entry costs applicable.
It can also be useful to buy a Wild Card, which offers access to certain parts of parks in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
The entire territory of Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong, which is considered by many tourists to be the most important place.
The large number of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline have been compared to a glittering bar graph that becomes visible thanks to the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the waterfront of Kowloon across the way.
The vast majority of the population of the island of Hong Kong lives very close together on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is where the British colonists settled, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forests in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into the Indian and Bengali interior.
The Sundarbans have now been officially included on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part within Indian borders is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are more than just mangrove swamps – they also contain some of the last mighty stretches of jungle that ever covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which a third is peat and marshland.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife reserve since 1966 and there are now an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 axis deer in the area.
During the day, buses depart from the station on the border of the districts (opposite the river). Most depart between 6.30 and 7.30 a.m., particularly in the direction of the east and Jakar/Bumthang.
It is wise to buy a ticket a few days in advance, as the local buses are often fully booked.
In most neighborhoods, small Japanese Coaster buses run that are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis can quickly and comfortably take you to nearby places such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable bridge that crosses the Oyapock River to connect the Brazilian city of Oiapoque and the French Guianese city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock.
The two towers are 83 meters high. The building is 378 meters long and has two passages with a width of 3.50 meters.
The clearance height under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction of the bridge was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
According to the plan, the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017. It is expected that the Brazilian customs posts will be ready for use by then.
The Guaraní were the most notable indigenous group. They lived in the area that is now East Paraguay, lived as semi-nomadic hunters, and also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
In the province of Chaco, other indigenous tribes lived, including the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who found their food by hunting, fishing, and gathering.
Paraguay, also known as 'the great province of India', emerged in the 16th century when Spanish colonizers encountered the indigenous population.
This was followed by a three-century period of colonisation by the Spaniards.
Asunción was founded in 1537 and since then, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year takes place on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
Check the Asociación Argentina de Polo for more information about tournaments and buying tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP). Its value is approximately one British pound (GBP).
There is only one bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store. Here you can exchange money.
In general, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands and in Stanley you can often pay with credit cards and American dollars.
On the remote islands, you probably cannot pay with a credit card, but you can probably pay with British and American currency. Ask the owners in advance about the payment methods.
Exchange your money again before you leave the islands, as Falkland currency is very difficult to exchange outside.
Montevideo is below the equator, so when it is summer there, it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months, temperatures of over +30°C are not uncommon.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature almost never drops below zero, but the wind combined with the humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
The rainfall level remains approximately the same throughout the year, without recognizable 'wet' and 'dry' periods.
Many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, but wild animals are ultimately just wild. Therefore, they should not be fed or disturbed.
Keep at least 100 metres away from bears and wolves in the park, and 25 metres away from all other wild animals.
Elk, bison, reindeer, bears, and pretty much all other large animals can attack you, no matter how tame they may seem.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, you should be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid wearing or cooking smelly food and keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia and the city with almost 40,000 inhabitants is located on the island of Upolu.
Apia was founded around the year 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, seven ships from Germany, the US, and Great Britain refused to leave the port. This later became known as the notorious stalemate.
With the exception of a British battleship, all ships were sunk. Almost 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the independence struggle by the Mau movement, the highest leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, died in a violent non-violent gathering that got out of hand in the city.
There are many beaches, particularly due to the two ports of Auckland. The most popular are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore in the North Harbour district stretch from north to south along the Pacific Ocean, from Long Bay to Devonport.
These are almost all sandy beaches where it is safe to swim and most have pohutukawa trees that provide shade.
At Waitemata's harbor, in the luxurious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, located in Central Auckland, you will find the Tamaki Drive beaches.
These family beaches are sometimes crowded and have a good range of shops on the coast. Swimming is not unsafe.
'Number One' is the most important local beer, which is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called 'Manta'.
There are many French wines to be found, but New Zealand and Australian wines are perhaps better suited for travel.
The local drinking water can be safely drunk, but bottled water is also easy to find if you don't trust it.
A 'flat white' is a strange concept for Australians. Black coffee is 'espresso', cappuccino has a lot of coffee milk (without foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian quality. Fruit juices are expensive, but great.
Trips to the reef take place throughout the year and injuries resulting from these trips to the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, seek expert advice and follow all signs and safety warnings.
Cubozoan jellyfish are found from October to April near beaches and river mouths north of Town of 1770. They can also be found outside of this period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would actually swim away.
The main habitat of saltwater crocodiles is in the river mouths north of Rockhampton and they do not normally live in the ocean.
Making a reservation in advance provides peace of mind for the traveler, knowing that they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have deals with certain hotels, although you can usually also book other types of accommodation through a travel agency, such as a campsite or a hotel.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast and transport to and from the airport, and sometimes even packages that include flights and hotels.
They can also hold your reservation if you want to think about the offer for a little longer or if you need to obtain documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, if you have a request or want to make a change, you should do this through the travel agency rather than the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of attendees at music festivals choose to camp on site and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to be early to secure a camping spot near the music.
And remember this: even when the music on the main stages has finished, music may still be played on other parts of the festival site until late at night.
For families with young children, there are special camping areas at some festivals.
Be careful where your cabin is located if you cross the Baltic Sea in winter, because the journey through the ice makes a tremendous noise if you are too close.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time to explore the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos usually strive to make the most of the time and money that guests spend. Windows and clocks are usually not present and the exit can sometimes be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers in the areas of food, drinks, and entertainment to keep them in a good mood and to prevent them from leaving.
Some locations offer free alcoholic drinks. However, when people are drunk, it affects their judgment, and all seasoned gamblers know that it is extremely important to stay sober.
If you go into the mountains or drive over mountain passes, you should be aware that there may be snow or ice and that the temperature can be extremely low.
On icy and snowy roads, there is little friction, and as a result, it drives differently than on asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to cause problems.
The visibility can also be impaired by falling or blowing snow or because there is condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries and do not hinder traffic here.
The biggest tourist attraction in Africa is safaris, which are the highlight of many visitors' trips.
In popular use, the term safari refers to travel over land to view the beautiful African wildlife, particularly on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars and a standard equipment makes a good view possible.
If you want to see lions, cheetahs, and leopards, you need binoculars. Otherwise, there is little chance that you will see them.
A walking safari (also called a 'forest walk' or 'walking safari') involves walking for several hours or days in a row.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted the Olympic Games twice. The first time was in 1964.
If you have already booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a precarious situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies are no longer valid until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled to take place.
According to expectations, most tickets for events will cost between ¥ 2,500 and ¥ 130,000. Normal tickets will cost around ¥ 7,000.
You can dry damp clothes by ironing them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available. You can often borrow these items, even if they are not in the room.
If there is no iron available or if you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can also use a hair dryer if available.
Make sure the fabric does not get too hot (this can cause the fabric to shrink or, in extreme cases, burn).
You can purify water in different ways. Some methods are effective at addressing specific risks.
In some areas, it is sufficient to boil water for a minute, in other areas, water must be boiled for several minutes.
Not every filter is equally effective. In case of doubt, it is best to drink water from a sealed bottle from a reliable company.
Travellers may encounter animal pests that do not exist in their own country.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Normally, infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that injure or kill people violently, are not considered pests.
Tax-free shopping means that you can buy goods at certain locations that are exempt from tax and excise duties.
Travellers going to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money on products such as alcoholic drinks and tobacco.
Point Marion and Fairmont are connected by the highway from Buffalo to Pittsburgh, and you often drive through abandoned hinterland, which makes this route a big challenge.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep your head up. You'll encounter many steep hills, narrow streets, and sharp turns.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and adjacent areas - usually around 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h - and it is even more important to adhere to them here than elsewhere.
Surprisingly, you have much more coverage here than in other corners of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries taste great and in Bavaria the pastries are fairly rich and varied, just like the pastries of our southern neighbour, Austria.
You see a lot of fruit pastries. Throughout the year, the pastries contain apples, and in the summer months, they also contain cherries and plums.
Many popular German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts, and go well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but mighty pastries, try some that are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen in the region.
To make a curry, you need spicy and pungent ingredients, combined with vegetables or meat.
Depending on the amount of liquid, a curry can be 'dry' or 'wet'.
In the interior of northern India and also Pakistan, yoghurt is often used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used instead.
Indonesian cuisine includes dishes from 17,000 islands and is an overarching concept for a variety of regional cuisines from all over the country.
But without additional information, the term refers to the food that originally comes from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine is now available throughout the archipelago and offers various simple spiced dishes. The most common Javanese flavorings are nuts, peppers, sugar (mainly Javanese coconut sugar) and various fragrant spices.
Stirrups support the rider's feet and hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with more stability, but can also pose safety problems because a rider's feet can get trapped in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but manages to hang on with one foot in the stirrup, they can be dragged along with the horse. To reduce the risk, a number of safety measures have been taken.
Most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars. This means that a saddle stirrup can come loose if it is pulled backwards when a rider falls off a horse.
Cochamó Valley - This is the most popular climbing destination in Chile. It is known as the Yosemite of South America, and has many different large granite walls and rocks.
The mountain peaks offer breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes on the rock walls, which seem to have endless potential.
Winter sports that involve descending, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular. You slide down a snow-covered slope on skis or a snowboard.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, who are sometimes also called 'ski bums', who plan entire holidays around skiing at a particular location.
Skiing has been around for a very long time: there are cave paintings of skiers dating back to 5000 BC!
The beginning of skiing dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational ski resort in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Backpacking with skis: this activity is also called off-piste skiing, skitouring or ski hiking.
It's not exactly the same, but it's similar to alpine skiing or mountain climbing, which is done a lot on steep terrain. You need much sturdier skis and boots for this.
You can see the ski route as a hiking route.
In good conditions, you can cover greater distances than when running, but it is rare that you can reach the speed of cross-country skiing on prepared slopes without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, travelers must apply for visas and undergo passport controls several times when traveling between different countries.
However, the Schengen area functions almost like one country in this area.
As long as you are in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to undergo passport control again.
If you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately for each Schengen country, which saves time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that indicates which produced items are antique. Some tax offices define antique goods as items that are older than 100 years.
The definition may differ per location. In North America, for example, the age limit is lower than in Europe.
It is possible to classify handmade products as antiques, even if they are newer than similar mass-produced products.
Among the Sámi, reindeer herding is an important form of livelihood. The culture surrounding trade is also very important for many with other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry. They made a living from fishing, hunting, and such things, and reindeer were usually used as draft animals.
Many Sámi work in modern professions today. In Sápmi, the Sámi area, tourism is an important source of income.
The word 'gypsy' is mainly used by non-Roma, but it is also often considered offensive due to associations with negative stereotypes and incorrect perceptions of the Roma.
If there is a travel advice for the country you want to go to, this can have consequences for your travel health insurance or your cancellation insurance.
In addition to the advice of your own government, you can also consult the advice of other governments. However, their advice is aimed at their own residents.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Reports only include a brief summary of the political situation in a single country.
They often provide a fleeting, general, and extremely simplistic picture compared to other, more detailed sources.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can lead to damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur all over the world. There are different types of weather conditions, which vary based on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
The effects and consequences of severe weather include strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and forest fires, but also thunderstorms, tornadoes, flash floods, and hurricanes.
Snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms are just some examples of regional and seasonal extreme weather phenomena.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks that severe weather conditions in their surroundings can bring, as they can also affect some travel plans.
Anyone who wants to visit a country that is considered a war zone should be professionally trained.
A search on the internet for 'course in hostile environments' is likely to yield the address of a local company.
In a course, all the issues outlined here are usually covered in more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course normally lasts 2 to 5 days and consists of role-playing, a lot of first aid and occasional weapons training.
There are many books and magazines with articles about survival in the wilderness, but there are few publications about war zones.
Travelers who have planned a gender surgery abroad should make sure they have the proper documentation for their return trip.
It varies quite a bit whether governments want to issue passports without a gender (X) listed, or whether they want to add a name or gender to documents.
There is just as much difference in the willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents.
Searches at security checks have also become much more extensive since September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery can assume that they will not come out of this scan with their privacy and dignity intact.
Muistromen are the recurring flow of waves that break on a reef or something similar and flow onto the beach.
Due to the submarine topography, the return flow is located in some deeper parts, where a fast current towards deep water can occur.
Most deaths are caused by exhaustion as people try to swim against the current. This could be impossible.
When you have escaped from the strong current, swimming back is a piece of cake.
Try to focus on a place where you won't be caught again. Depending on your skills and whether you have been noticed, you can also wait for help.
The shock of returning is worse than the culture shock (you have a lesser 'honeymoon feeling'), it lasts longer, and it can be more intense.
Travelers who easily adapt to new cultures sometimes have trouble adjusting to their own culture again.
If you have lived abroad and then returned, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some habits from your own culture in the process.
In the past, when you went abroad, you noticed that people were patient and understanding. They understood that travelers had to adjust to a new country.
Usually, patience and understanding are not expected for travelers returning home.
For children, the pyramid show with light and sound is one of the most interesting activities in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in complete silence before the show starts.
Often, the sound of vendors and tourists can be heard here. The story of the light and sound is similar to that of a book.
The Sphinx forms the background and is the narrator of a long story.
The scenes appear as a projection on the pyramids and the rest of the pyramids are highlighted.
The South Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819 and have since been claimed by various countries. They have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others are Livingston Island and Deception. Here you will find the overflowing crater of an active volcano that serves as a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth is located on the southern side of the peninsula, near the border with the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula give way to the plateau, after which they reappear to form the 360 km long Mount Ellsworth mountain range, which is crossed by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, also known as the Sentinel Range, includes the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif. Mount Vinson is the highest mountain at 4892 meters.
A satellite phone may be your only option in remote locations where there is no mobile phone reception.
A satellite phone is not really a replacement for a mobile phone, as you have to stand outside with a clear view of the satellite in order to make a phone call.
This service is often used by shipping, including pleasure craft, and for expeditions where external data and communication are needed.
Your local phone provider can give you more information on how to connect to this service.
It is becoming increasingly popular for people who plan to take a gap year to travel and learn.
School leavers in particular use this to take a gap year before university without it having any negative consequences for their education.
Often, enrolling in a course abroad during a gap year can increase your chances of returning to higher education in your own country.
Normally, tuition fees must be paid for enrollment in these educational programs.
Finland is a fantastic destination for sailing. The 'Land of a Thousand Lakes' also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the archipelagos off the coast.
A yacht is not necessary for the archipelagos or lakes.
The archipels along the coast and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, but with smaller boats or even a kayak, you get a completely different experience.
In Finland, so many people sail in their free time that the ratio of boats to people is one to seven or eight.
The figure is equal to the figure for Norway, Sweden and New Zealand. Furthermore, it is quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises include a long stay in St. Petersburg (Russia).
This way, you can spend several full days in the historic town and spend the night on the ship.
Since 2009, you do not need a separate visa if you only go ashore on a boat excursion.
Some cruises include a visit to the German capital Berlin, but as you can see on the map, Berlin is not close to the sea. A visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be daunting for people of all backgrounds and ages, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's no different from many fears that other people also have.
If you know how planes work, this can help to alleviate a fear that comes from the unknown or from the fact that you have no control over the plane.
Courier companies receive a generous compensation to deliver items quickly. For business documents, goods or spare parts for a necessary repair, time often plays a very important role.
Larger companies could use their own planes for certain routes, but it became more difficult for other routes and smaller companies.
If they send things by air, it can take days on some routes before they are unloaded and cleared by customs.
Only checked baggage could be processed more quickly. According to the rules of airlines, there must be an accompanying passenger and that is you.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a lot of money for this privilege (or even better, have your employer pay for it).
However, this is not cheap: the rule of thumb is that you pay about four times as much for business class as you do for economy, and about eleven times as much for first class.
It usually doesn't make sense to look for discounts for business class or first class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know all too well that there is a group of flyers who are willing to pay a lot of money to fly somewhere quickly and comfortably, and the airlines therefore charge appropriate costs for this.
Chişinău is the capital of Moldova. The Romanian language is mainly spoken here, but the Russian language is also very common.
As a multi-ethnic republic, Moldova was plagued by an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria in the east of Moldova. This republic has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by members of the UN.
Economic ties have been reestablished between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in Moldova.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the largest port after Istanbul and a good transport hub.
The once ancient city of İzmir is now a modern, developed and busy commercial center on a bay, surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, the glass buildings and the modern shopping centers covered with red roof tiles, the 18th-century markets, the old mosques and churches, but still the city feels more like a Mediterranean, European city than traditionally Turkish.
In the village of Haldarsvík, you can enjoy views of the nearby island of Eysturoy, as well as a special church with eight corners.
There are some interesting marble pigeon sculptures on a number of graves near the church.
If you have half an hour to spare, you should definitely take a look around this village.
In the north, you will find the easily accessible, romantic and fascinating town of Sintra. Sintra became famous among foreigners after Lord Byron spoke highly of the beautiful monuments there.
Scotturb bus 403 regularly runs to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also head north to see the beautiful Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (a temple complex), where internationally renowned Marian apparitions took place.
Remember that you are actually just visiting a mass grave, but also a place that has an almost incalculable significance for a large part of the world's population.
Many men and women who survived their time here are still alive, and many of them have loved ones who were murdered there or worked themselves to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Show all appropriate respect, solemnity, and dignity during your visit. Do not trivialise the Holocaust or Nazism.
Do not damage the site by applying markings or graffiti to the construction works.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer Catalan, the vast majority can understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most signs are in Catalan, as that is the first official language according to the law.
Spanish is frequently spoken in public transport and other facilities.
Ordinary announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but unscheduled interruptions are made by an automated system in several languages, including French, Arabic, Spanish, English, and even Japanese.
The inhabitants of Paris are known for being selfish, rude and arrogant.
Although this is usually just an incorrect stereotype, it can't hurt to put your best foot forward in Paris and act like someone who is 'bien élevé' (well-mannered). This will make it a lot easier to explore Paris.
The tough exterior of the Parisians quickly disappears when you show that you are familiar with their way of doing things.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested and this forested area consists mainly of beeches, firs, and pines, and includes a combination of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
There are a great many different plant communities, due to the different microclimates, different types of soil and varying altitude differences.
This area is also the habitat of a very wide range of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat and the capercaillie can be found here, in addition to all kinds of more common species.
When women visit a monastery, they are required to wear a skirt to their knees and their shoulders must be covered.
Usually, you will be given a veil as a woman if you arrive at a monastery unprepared, but if you bring your own example, with nice bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you kindly.
On the other hand, men must wear pants that reach at least above the knee.
You can also borrow these from the stock at the entrance, but this clothing is not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable with that. One size fits all for men!
Like many other Mediterranean regions, the cuisine of Mallorca is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and olive oil is used extensively.
A simple and popular dish for dinner, especially during the summer months, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and whatever flavorings are available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Independent nouns, just like Sie was bedeutet, always have a capital letter at the beginning, even if they are in the middle of the sentence.
In this way, you can make a significant difference between a number of verbs and objects.
It probably also makes reading easier. However, writing is more complicated, because you have to figure out whether a verb or adjective should be used as a noun.
Most Italian words are written exactly as they are pronounced, so pronunciation generally poses few problems.
You should pay the most attention to the c and the g. The pronunciation of these letters depends on the vowel that follows them.
You also have to pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means sweetheart, while carro means car.
The Persian language has a relatively simple and usually regular grammar.
Reading this introduction to grammar will therefore teach you a lot about the grammar of Persian and help you understand sentences.
It is quite logical that if you know a Romance language, it is easier for you to learn Portuguese.
But people who speak a bit of Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is so similar that you don't need to learn it separately.
Premodern observatories are now obsolete and serve as museums or educational attractions.
Light pollution was not as big a problem back then as it is today, so they were often built in cities or on campuses, which were more accessible than they are today.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities built in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami is the practice of viewing cherry blossoms and has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
In China, plum blossoms were the favorite flowers and that is where the concept came from.
The first cherry blossom festivals in Japan were organized by the emperor and were intended only for himself and other aristocrats at the imperial court.
Plants look best in a natural environment, which means you should resist the temptation to remove even just one species.
If you collect samples during a visit to a landscaped garden, you will be denied access to the garden immediately and without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to stay, very easy to navigate and almost everything is available upon arrival.
But if you are in the 'high tropics', just a few degrees north of the equator, you experience both heat (always) and strong sun (when the air is clear, this happens less often).
There are also some buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Isaac, Jacob, Abraham, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you take to Hebron actually goes there and doesn't just drive to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great holiday destination.
For example, you can visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, book a cruise to the interesting cities along the Danube or take a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also provide popular walking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
People who do not believe in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world have also adopted many traditions that are associated with the holiday.
There is a tradition where you stay up all of Easter night until you can see the sunrise at some point.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could just as well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
In traditional churches, a Easter Vigil is often held on the Saturday evening of the Easter weekend. At midnight, the congregations often celebrate a feast in honor of the resurrection of Christ.
All animals that originally arrived at the islands came here by swimming, flying or drifting.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, it was not possible for mammals to make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the most common grazing mammal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans set foot on the Galapagos, all kinds of mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
During the winter, polar night occurs in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, which means that the sun does not actually rise.
There is a good chance that you will be able to see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be dark most of the day and night.
The areas are sparsely populated, so light pollution is not often a problem, which means you can also enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese work environment is more structured and formal than in the Western world.
Work clothes are standard and colleagues call each other by their last name or job title.
Unity in the workplace is crucial. The focus is on group performance rather than rewarding individual work performance.
Employees often need permission from their supervisors before they can make a decision and they are expected to follow their supervisors' instructions without question.
