Diego Cocca is the new national coach of Mexico
In the summer of 2026, Mexico will host the World Cup together with the USA and Canada, which will be the first time with 48 teams. Cocca is taking over from Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not extended after the early World Cup exit in Qatar. The 50-year-old was not one of the favorites for the position until a few days ago. He only took over as coach of the Mexican club Tigres in November. His surprising appointment as national coach caused anger in the club.
Geesthacht: New bed signs are intended to encourage replanting
Franko Stein (FD Environment, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) are putting up the plant signs in the flower beds of the pedestrian zone.
The "Geesthacht is blooming" campaign also includes information about what is currently in bloom in the town - currently white and pink.
Geesthacht. "Geesthacht is blooming" is an action of the Nabu in cooperation with the city administration. Since 2015, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been planted with the help of many volunteers from clubs, schools, kindergartens, companies and institutions. The aim: large-scale flower islands should arise in the Geesthacht area, where insects can find food at any time. "With favorable weather conditions, the bees are already flying out in January to look for food," says Friedhelm Ringe from the Geesthacht Nabu. He has beehives on his property.
So that the effort is not just an action of nature conservationists and the city's environmental department, but also reaches out to private gardens, explanatory signs are being put up for the plants. There are about 50 signs so far. Passers-by should be able to find out this way what is currently blooming. The hope is that amateur gardeners will specifically replicate the plants at home.
The wild hazel had already started its season in the first week of January
More recent are shrubs such as Winter Sweet and Snowball in the flower beds of the pedestrian zone. They have been in the soil of the pots on Bergedorer Straße for a year now, and are just showing the first tender white and pink flowers, without leaves. They have recently been marked with additional signs. "The Winter Sweet is a very bushy shrub and can grow up to two metres high and three metres wide," it says there, among other things, about the suitable location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasises that it is not only the bedding plants that are now showing flowers. In the first week of January, the wild hazel was already in season. It is particularly abundant in bloom on the Richtweg, on the slope, in Gutenbergstraße, Wilhelm-Holert-Straße, Fahrendofer Weg and many other places.
Ernestine is 102: "Hiking keeps me young"
Munich - Dance god Fred Astaire would surely be proud of them if he looked down from heaven to Munich's Ostbahnhof!
This is because three ladies meet there every Monday at 3 p.m. in the "Mandolin Motion Show Academy" for a lively step dance - together they are an incredible 277 years old, sorry, young!
The eldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, who recently celebrated her 102nd birthday.
For the native Munich resident (15th January 1921) from Schwanthalerhöhe, Monday is the highlight of the week. "Dancing and stepping is my life, without it I can't imagine myself."
Ernestine is also joined by Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) who are also dancing.
The 97-year-old was born in Jena (Thüringen) in 1926. She was a soubrette, which today would be called a musical performer, and worked with the legendary Marika Rökk. "I spent my life dancing, acting and singing."
At 79 years of age, Elfriede Widmann is something of a chick in the circle of steppers. She says: "We're just having fun with our dance teacher Sissy Engl".
Wikipedia: The tap dance was developed in the 19th century in the USA and is now known all over the world. With two metal plates, which are more durable than the wooden soles initially used, attached to the front and back of the shoes, rhythmic sounds are produced during the dance, which match the visual impression and the music. The dancer thus becomes a percussion musician. The English expression for this is tap dance and the French claquettes. The Spanish flamenco could have influenced the tap dance. The tips of the shoes are nailed so that they produce a well-audible sound during the dance.
The 77-year-old Sissi Engl is the soul of the dance studio at Ostbahnhof. She is an actress, dancer and choreographer. "We are a big family, where the young and old are welcome."
And what is the recipe for such a long life? "Movement keeps me young," the 102-year-old says to BILD. Her advice to everyone: "Sport, healthy food and no alcohol."
Analog in the dialogue - The limits of the digital
As digitalisation progresses, many people are rediscovering their love of the analogue
The speed with which our everyday lives have become digital has left us little time to establish rules for dealing with it and to adapt our communication and working methods to it, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden. If you wanted to have a telephone conversation in Bautzen in 1985, you had three options. Either you were one of the six percent of the lucky ones who had a private line. Or you belonged to those who had someone from this exclusive group in the neighbourhood and could call their relatives there for a bottle of Radeberger. Or you looked for a telephone booth. The smell of the plastic receiver and the sound of the small change in the machine are unforgettable. My biggest dream was to be able to see the face of the other person when I was on the phone - video telephony, I thought, what a great thing that would be!
What next for Moldova? 14 days for a new government
In Moldova (also: Moldavia), the President Maia Sandu has commissioned the former Minister of the Interior Dorin Recean with the formation of a government.
The 48-year-old economic expert now has 14 days to do so. Recean was previously one of the president's advisors.
After only one and a half years in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita resigned unexpectedly. The pro-European head of government was under massive pressure, as she herself announced as an explanation for her resignation - apparently she was being attacked by pro-Russian forces.
The President thanked Gavrilita for her "enormous sacrifice".
Moldova is a neighbouring country of Ukraine and is suffering from the economic consequences of the war. Inflation is over 40 percent and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the parliament in Chisinau, the pro-European party PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity), founded by President Sandu, has a comfortable majority, occupying 63 of the 101 seats. The confirmation of the new head of government and his cabinet should therefore not pose a problem.
However, pro-European politicians have lost popularity in Moldova in recent months, while pro-Russian politicians - with support from the Kremlin - have become more popular.
These were the costumes of the celebrities
In 2023, Veitshöchheim will celebrate in style once again. The fifth season is in full swing and the celebrities were not slow to respond.
The father of the land, Markus Söder, did not come as Moses, as suggested by his costume. He sees himself more as the tribal elder of Bavaria. By his side is his wife Karin Baumüller-Söder.
Bavaria's Minister for Environment and Consumer Protection, Thorsten Glauber, chose the children's hero Chase from Paw Patrol for his costume.
From the depths of the sea to Franconia came Justice Minister Georg Eisenreich with his wife Anja.
Completely detached: Minister for Science and Art, Markus Blume, is drawn to space.
The President of the State Parliament, Ilse Aigner, chose no less than "Mama Bavaria" as a role model for her costume.
In peace and love mode: Bavaria's Minister of Health Klaus Holetschek with his wife Birgit.
Bob the Builder, aka Building Minister Christian Bernreiter, with his wife Ann-Kathrin Jandt-Bernreiter as Wendy.
Bavaria's golden boy: Finance Minister Albert Füracker with his wife Evelyne. She wore silver.
He even plays the sheriff in carnival: Bavaria's Minister of the Interior Joachim Herrmann, with his wife Gerswid.
At the ball: Economic Minister Hubert Aiwanger pays homage to the crafts with his costume. His partner Tanja Schweiger, district administrator of the Regensburg district, does the same.
The political opposition was of course also present.
Everything for Bavaria: Green Party parliamentary group leader Katharina Schulze as Bavaria and her co-chief Ludwig Hartmann as the Bavarian lion.
The SPD faction leader enjoys hiking: Florian von Brunn with SPD state chairman Ronja Endres.
Royal was it with FDP faction leader Martin Hagen. He and his wife Anisha came as Harry and Meghan.
Otherwise he would certainly say more. In Veitshöchheim, the group chairman in the EU Parliament, Manfred Weber, was on his way as a pantomime. Andrea was with him.
If politics don't work out, he can always do magic. Nuremberg's mayor Marcus König as Harry Potter and his wife Anke as Hermione.
Quick as a bee: Bavaria's Digital Minister Judith Gerlach.
Back to the 1920s: BR's legal director, Eva Majuntke, BR's director Katja Wildermuth and BR's cultural programme director Björn Wilhelm.
A small dig at the climate activists from the Franconian Tatort detective Sebastian Fleischer, played by Alexander Leopold Schadt.
The First Mayor of Veitshöchheim was of course also present. Jürgen Götz and his wife Julia.
Oberhof: Kühn eighth in the World Championship sprint
Bö continued his impressive series despite difficult conditions and also won the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic champion has now collected 14 World Championship titles and is closing in on his countryman Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, who is a TV expert on site, is still the undisputed record champion with 20 World Championship gold medals. Even heavy fog did not prevent the long-term winner Bö from collecting his second gold at the Rennsteig. On Wednesday, it was already enough for the successful title defense with Norway's mixed relay team.
Hardly anyone doubts that the third race will be a hunting race. In the pursuit, Bö is once again the clear favourite. His running form is outstanding, so he can compensate for shooting errors to a certain extent, which is quite amazing.
Meanwhile, Doll was not performing well. After the veteran had given up all chances of a medal in the mixed relay with a penalty lap and only managed sixth place, things did not go any better three days later. Three penalty laps in prone shooting and two more in standing were a great disappointment for the oldest member of the German team, who had celebrated the greatest success of his career in this discipline in 2017.
Six years ago, he won in Hochfilzen surprisingly with a 0.7 second lead, just barely ahead of Bö. It was one of only three career successes for Dolls, who so far has only stood on the podium once this winter. The eighth place finisher from the Olympics in Beijing left without saying a word after his weak performance and did not give any interviews. Roman Rees managed to get to 19th place, and the second World Cup debutant David Zobel took 35th place.
Biden receives Lula: "We must stand up for democracy"
A meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is mainly about the value of democracy. Both are looking back to their predecessors.
During a visit to his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, US President Joe Biden emphasised the importance of maintaining democratic values.
"The strong democracy of our two nations has been put to the test," said Biden on Friday in the White House in Washington. "We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that are at the core of our strength." Lula replied, looking at his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro: "Brazil has isolated itself for four years."
The left-wing politician Lula had prevailed over Bolsonaro in a run-off election at the end of October. Lula took office on January 1. The change of power was accompanied by violent riots. Bolsonaro's supporters had stormed the Congress, the Supreme Court and the government headquarters in the capital Brasilia in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil reminds us in a dark way of the storming of the US Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump, who violently broke into the parliament in Washington almost two years ago.
Lula criticised Bolsonaro openly during the meeting with Biden. His predecessor did not give much thought to international relations. "His world began and ended with fake news, in the morning, in the afternoon and in the evening," said Lula. "That sounds familiar," replied Biden - an obvious reference to his predecessor Trump.
A brief note on the press - Friday
Does anyone still remember the RAF wanted posters? They showed the members of the Red Army Faction who were authorised to be denounced and executed.
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which existed before Corona, public opinion was created against the most dangerous opponents of the FRG; let's say against bourgeois democracy, let's say against the late capitalist society. (Here nothing about the really dangerous ones in a pin-striped suit and tie.)
Now the Stuttgart newspaper, which is usually more interested in Raudis in the S-Bahn or masturbators in the park, is publishing a new edition with the "war criminal" Putin's friends. Because they are so nice, there is a picture gallery. Of course, the StZ is poorly informed, because there are probably more "Russian friends" in this world that Asia, Africa and Latin America that the StZ has room for pictures.
But that is not the point. The point is that Frau Wagenknecht is in 1st to 5th place (!), then Frau Schwarzer follows.
Well, I don't know anyone in my area who reads that paper any more, if they do it's about time they did. We've reached the well known level where there's nothing under it.
And now, at least, Frau Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician of all the people who are not yet completely stupid, i.e. peace-loving, pacifistic and anti-militaristic people. (And here no differentiation is needed anymore.)
Harald Glööckler files for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth
Designer Harald Glööckler (57) and his partner Dieter Schroth (74) have separated. Glööckler's lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser confirmed this to the "Bild" newspaper and RTL, saying: "I can confirm that my client has filed an application to dissolve his registered partnership with his family lawyer at the relevant court. I will not be making any further comments on the details."
Glööckler and his life partner Schroth were together for 35 years, and rumours of a separation have been circulating for about a year. According to various media reports, the fashion designer had already moved from their shared house in the Palatinate to Berlin after his appearance in the jungle camp. He also spoke about marital problems on the RTL show.
SS massacre in Oradour-sur-Glane: Last survivor dead
In 1999, a memorial centre was established in the destroyed village northwest of Limoges, the ruins of which have been preserved. France's President Emmanuel Macron awarded Hébras with the national order of merit a year ago. Hébras fought for freedom and defended the values of France, Macron said. He also contributed to the German-French peace. The survivor had campaigned for German-French youth encounters, among other things.
A curve for 14 houses: In Homeien, everyone knows everyone
LZ series Nordlippische Weiler: In Homeien, not infrequently, three or four generations live under one roof. Here, the residents find pure idyll. In the summer, 300 motorcycles per day race along the winding road between Niedermeien and Hillentrup - and some even go back again.
Christian Sewing, the head of Deutsche Bank, considers further interest rate hikes in the fight against high inflation rates to be "absolutely" necessary. "The inflationary risks are still high. The costs for energy can easily rise again, and the opening of China can also give prices a temporary boost," Sewing told the "Welt am Sonntag."
The European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates in the eurozone for the fifth time in a row at the beginning of February and has announced another increase of 0.5 percentage points for the meeting on 16 March. The key interest rate in the eurozone is now 3.0 percent. The deposit rate that commercial banks receive when they park money with the ECB is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates make loans more expensive, which can slow demand and help to counteract high inflation. Higher borrowing costs can also lead to postponed investment, which can weigh on economic growth.
Rising interest rates are also a burden for highly indebted euro states such as Italy. "The consequences of a permanently high inflation are much more serious than the higher financing costs for some countries," said Sewing. "Of course, we have to keep this in mind, but a high level of debt should not prevent the ECB from acting consistently."
The ECB aims for medium-term price stability in the eurozone with an inflation rate of two percent. This target has been far away for months. In January, the price increase weakened again, but consumer prices in the monetary area of the now 20 countries were still 8.5 percent above the level of the previous year.
Higher inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of consumers, because they can afford less for a euro. Strongly increased energy prices, which are a major driver of inflation, are also a burden for companies.
If inflation remains high, private consumption will "decline sooner or later," warned Sewing, who is also president of the Federal Association of German Banks (BdB). "I see this as the greatest danger for the German economy at the moment, but I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario."
Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung hopes for a broad debate on the "Germany speed" called for by Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) for infrastructure projects. "There will have to be a political and social dialogue about it. And it may also be a bit more controversial," he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart. He hopes that in the end, a set of rules will emerge with which it will not necessarily have to go as fast as with the LNG terminals put into operation around the turn of the year - but not as slow as before either.
In mid-December, after ten months of planning and construction, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened. The aim was to close the gap in the gas supply to some extent due to the lack of Russian gas deliveries. Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) had spoken of a new "Germany speed" on this occasion. In addition, the federal government had recently brought about an acceleration of approval procedures for wind turbines and power lines.
"First of all, it is very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it comes to it. But that should not automatically mean that we always act so categorically and, for example, put a windmill in the garden against the neighbor's will," said Hartung. Therefore, there must still be a negotiation process, what one finds right and wrong as a society.
In the past, we have tried to use the classic rule book and failed. "We should think again about whether our previous approach was the right one. Perhaps we have overdone it with the rules and made things too complicated".
In view of the many open tasks, for example, in the expansion of power lines, Hartung said that he does not envy the Federal Government and the companies involved, "As a consumer of this energy, I need the expansion and it should be as green as possible."
Trade union warns of the break-up of the Bayer corporation
The chemical workers' union IG BCE warns of a break-up of the company following an announced change in leadership at Bayer. "From the perspective of employees, Bayer is perfectly positioned with its three pillars to meet the challenges of the future," said Francesco Grioli, a board member of the union and a member of the Bayer supervisory board, to the "Rheinische Post" (Saturday edition).
This refers to the pharmaceutical business with prescription drugs, the Consumer Health business with non-prescription drugs and the agricultural business. "The transformation of the industry can only be achieved with a corporate policy based on risk diversification and sustainability - and not on hedge fund activism".
The background is the change in management at the pharmaceutical and agrochemical company announced on Thursday. The controversial CEO Werner Baumann will be stepping down from his position this summer. The new CEO will be Bill Anderson, the former CEO of the Swiss rival Roche, at the beginning of June.
Baumann has been under criticism for a long time. The 2018 acquisition of the US seed producer Monsanto for 63 billion dollars is hanging over the manager's head. The purchase had brought the Leverkusen company expensive legal disputes about alleged cancer risks of the weed killer glyphosate. The Bayer share has been in freefall for years. In 2019, the shareholders even refused to grant the CEO discharge at the annual general meeting.
It has been known for some time that Baumann does not want to extend his contract, which was actually set to run until 2024. Long-term oriented strategic investors had put pressure on him. Recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors such as Bluebell Capital have also been involved. Bluebell is pushing for a split of the company, according to a media report.
The very small fund with an unknown level of participation in Bayer is known for its aggressive approach. A separation of "the Consumer Health division would be a possible way to increase the company's value," said Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, to the "Rheinische Post." He does not, however, believe that a separation of the much larger agricultural division Crop Science is feasible.
Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate against pension reform
Paris
The French want to take to the streets again on Saturday against the planned pension reform.
The unions are putting up a united protest against a government plan. Hundreds of thousands of people want to demonstrate against the pension reform again on Saturday.
In France, hundreds of thousands of people are expected to demonstrate again on Saturday, nationwide, against President Emmanuel Macron's planned pension reform. For the fourth time, the unions are mobilising against the plans of the centre-right government to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. Twice already, over a million people took to the streets and there were nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 participants were counted at protests. There has been a turbulent debate about the controversial reform in parliament for a week.
Already, many people in France work longer than until the age of 62, if they have not paid in long enough for a pension free of deductions when they reach retirement age. In many demanding professions, people could hardly work any longer, the opponents of the reform believe. In addition, employees want to be able to enjoy their well-deserved pension and not wear out their health completely in the job.
Macron: Threatening deficit in pension fund
Macron justifies the reform with a looming deficit in the pension fund. As the population is getting older, employees will have to pay more to cover the increasing number of pensioners. In order to keep the level of pensions stable, people will have to work a little longer. Critics doubt the government's calculations and demand that the state find other sources of income to keep the pension system in balance.
But the government wants to tighten not only the retirement age. The increase in the necessary contribution period for a full pension, which was decided years ago, is to be accelerated. In addition, individual pension systems with privileges for certain professions are to be abolished. The minimum pension is to rise to around 1,200 euros.
The pension reform is considered one of President Macron's most important projects. During the Corona pandemic, a first attempt to implement the reform was abandoned, and there were massive protests and strikes even then. Several presidents before Macron have tried to reform the French pension system with varying degrees of success - and there was always broad protest and strikes.
Since Macron's camp no longer has an absolute majority in parliament, it hopes to push through the reform with the help of the conservative Républicains, who have announced their support. However, some of the members of parliament - even from Macron's own party - still have reservations. And greater than the fear of a close vote at the moment is Macron's concern about paralysing strikes. Before the renewed demonstrations on Saturday, the president said that he could count on the organisers to act responsibly, so that they would proceed peacefully and not lead to a blockade of the country.
Quiet weather expected - lots of sunshine in high altitudes
A powerful high-pressure area is located over Central Europe and is determining the weather in Germany. Does this mean that sunshine is to be expected everywhere?
Offenbach
In Germany, calm high-pressure weather is expected at least until the middle of the week. "When looking at the weather maps, a powerful high-pressure area directly over Central Europe immediately catches the eye," explains meteorologist Markus Übel from the German Weather Service on Saturday in Offenbach. "Although this high moves a little to the east over the course of the next week, it will still determine the weather in Germany."
However, calm high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Übel. "Such a high can even be quite mean and give people in the lowlands a dreary, high-level fog for days, while there is pure sunshine in the highlands of the middle mountains".
Sunday will start in most regions with a misty-dreary atmosphere. According to the DWD, it may also rain in the Erzgebirge and the Thüringer Wald region, as well as in Lower Bavaria. In the afternoon, the cloud cover will lift, especially along the Alpine range, but also in the southwest and parts of the west. The sun will become more frequent. In the rest of the country, the sky will remain heavily overcast or covered in a thick fog. Temperatures will range from 4 to 9 degrees Celsius, with 10 degrees Celsius in the Rhine area.
"On Monday, the sun, which is gradually becoming stronger, will nibble away at the high fog again and can dissolve it more and more during the course of the day," says the meteorologist. Sunshine is expected throughout the day on the edge of the Alps, in the highlands of the Central Uplands and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia. Elsewhere, the sun has to fight its way through the high fog. The maximum temperatures are between 5 and 9 degrees, around 11 degrees are expected in the Lower Rhine region, while only around 3 degrees are expected in the southeast in the permanent grey. A weak wind is blowing from different directions.
On Tuesday, in some low-lying areas, there may be only a slow clearing of fog or thick fog. Otherwise, the weather will be sunny after the fog clears. In high-lying areas, in large parts of NRW and on the edge of the Alps, the sun is expected to shine all day, according to the forecast. Temperatures will rise to between 5 and 11 degrees Celsius, depending on the amount of sunshine.
Dominatorin is disappointed: Goggia will not win another World Championship medal
The favourite Sofia Goggia, who was knocked out in the downhill of the Alpine Ski World Championships, was severely disappointed.
Méribel
"I am sad because I did not perform to the level I can," said the Italian on ZDF, after she had set up a goal and was eliminated. The 30-year-old was able to prevent a potentially serious fall.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill skier in the World Cup for years. She has won four of the six previous season races in this discipline. After winning gold in Pyeongchang in 2018, she won silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. Goggia, who is known for her risky driving style, still has to wait for a World Championship medal in her specialty. At her home game in Cortina d'Ampezzo two years ago, she was absent due to injury.
"I actually thought I was in good form. It was all about hundredths of a second," said Goggia after the surprise victory of Swiss skier Jasmine Flury in Méribel in France. "I am disappointed. I gave it my all. But that's life." Sometimes you believe things are guaranteed, she said about the medal that was expected by all experts and ultimately missed: "But they are not."
Girl missing in Berlin: Who has seen Viktoriya?
Viktoriya Stankovych has been missing since 10 February.
Viktoriya Stankovych was last seen at Waidmannslust S-Bahn station on Friday. The police are asking for information about her whereabouts.
Berlin. With the publication of a photo, the Berlin police are asking for the public's help in the search for a missing child. The 12-year-old Viktoriya Stankovych is said to have left the grounds of her school together with other children at around 12:30 on 10 February 2023. She was last seen at the Waidmannslust S-Bahn station. The child has been a refugee in Berlin since April 2022 and has only very limited knowledge of the German language and the local area.

Selenskyj and ministers against Russia's participation in the Olympics
Kiev. With the demand for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, sports politicians from 35 nations have increased the pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
It was agreed at a joint telephone conference to draw up a statement to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sporting competitions, the Lithuanian Ministry of Sports announced on its website.
"We demand the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues," said Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė.
The video consultation had taken place on the initiative of Great Britain. It was a very productive meeting, wrote the British Minister of Sport Lucy Frazer on Twitter. "And I made the position of Great Britain very clear: as long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus should not be represented at the Olympic Games. We will now issue a joint statement on this topic".
Previously, the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had protested against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions during an international video conference of sports ministers and other high-ranking representatives. "While Russia is killing and terrorizing, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions," said Zelenskyy. He published his speech on his Telegram channel. In the end, a neutral flag is also stained with blood and is not wearable because of the Russian war of aggression.
Ukraine threatens with boycott
Ukraine also sees Belarus as a party to the war, because the country provides Russian troops with military bases for attacks. Selenskyj called on officials to work for the protection of Olympic principles and to prevent Russian athletes from participating in the competitions. The President also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which he said had unfortunately lost its "honesty".
The reason for the conference was the announcement by the IOC that it wanted to allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international competitions under certain conditions. Ukraine has also threatened to boycott the games if the IOC allows the athletes to participate.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a position
The Federal Ministry of the Interior, which is responsible for sports, subsequently declared that it had also confirmed during the consultations that it would refuse to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to start in Paris. "In our view, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian sport to return to competition. Ukrainian athletes must continue to receive the full solidarity and support of the international sports community. The IOC's effort to reinstate Russian and Belarusian athletes is the wrong way," a spokesperson for the Ministry of the Interior told dpa in response to a request for information.
The Minister of the Interior, Nancy Faeser (SPD), had already emphasized at the end of January: "Sport should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against the Ukrainian civilian population. Major sporting events do not take place in a vacuum." Russia, on the other hand, emphasizes that sport and politics must be kept separate.
Currently, Russia and Belarus are excluded from many international sporting competitions. However, the IOC is aiming for a return of athletes from both countries to the international sporting stage under a neutral flag, provided they clearly declare their allegiance to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach recently stated that exclusion "because of a passport or place of birth" violates the ban on discrimination.
Pointing out where it happens
"Hey, nice ass!" whistling at the foolish woman in the tight sexy costume and shouting lewd comments: all of this falls under the term "Catcalling". The term conceals nothing less than a form of verbal sexual harassment in public spaces.
Half of the vehicles lost? USA see Moscow's tank stocks greatly depleted
Half of the vehicles lost? USA see Moscow's tank stocks greatly depleted
The Pentagon assumes that Russia has lost a considerable number of tanks in Ukraine since the beginning of the war. The talk is of "half of the main stock".
The Russian army has already lost half of its battle tanks in its attack on Ukraine, according to estimates by the US Department of Defense. "Probably half of the main stock of tanks" of the Russian army has been "destroyed or confiscated" by Ukraine, said Celeste Wallander, Under Secretary for International Security Affairs in the US Department of Defense.
Wallander did not provide any further details about the number of tanks seized and destroyed according to US estimates at an online event of the think tank Center for a New American Security.
Ukraine is to receive battle tanks from several Western allies in the coming weeks. Great Britain has promised to deliver Challenger-2 battle tanks to Kiev in March. Germany wants to deliver a battalion of Leopard-2 tanks to Ukraine in a coalition with other states by April. The USA has also promised a battalion of 31 battle tanks of the Abrams type, but their delivery is expected to take much longer.
Russia wants to catch up
In response to Western military aid, former Kremlin chief Dmitry Medvedev has promised to build and modernise thousands of tanks. "As we know, our enemy abroad has been begging for planes, missiles and tanks," said Medvedev, now deputy head of Russia's Security Council, during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. "It is clear that in this case it is self-evident for us to increase the production of various types of weapons and military technology - including modern tanks."
A law that allows the economy to be more closely aligned with the needs of the army has been in force in Russia since last summer. This means that individual industries can be obliged to supply the armed forces.
Turmoil over the filling of positions in the army
This is because the post that the former director of the Heeresgeschichtliches Museum (HGM) Christian Ortner will hold in the future was not advertised. The personnel representative of the Academy, Herwig Jedlaucnik, suspects that the post was given through corruption and abuse of office. Defence Minister Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends the procedure.
A tender is not necessary because the appointment is for an unoccupied position, said the minister. "I do not want to comment on the speculations of a representative of the Freedom Party." Ortner was replaced last year after 17 years at the head of the HGM. In addition to criticism of the museum's handling of Austria's military past, he was faced with serious accusations of mobbing. These are cleared up in Tanner's view.
Jedlaucnik also doubts the suitability of Ortner in terms of content. Ortner is an expert on the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute is concerned with current issues of security policy.
The SPÖ is demanding that Tanner provide an explanation for the "unusual appointment process". The decision was tainted by the "appearance of job-swapping", says SPÖ defence spokesman Robert Laimer. The Neos are calling on Tanner to withdraw the appointment. The ÖVP is "up to its neck in the corruption quagmire", said Douglas Hoyos, spokesman for state defence. He announced that a parliamentary inquiry would be launched on the subject.
Carnival: The first fools are going down on costs
Thuringia's carnival stronghold Wasungen wants to stick to the traditional carnival parade, unlike the state capital. However, the higher costs, including for security, are difficult to manage, says carnival president Marcel Kißling. The funds alone for this make up about half of the calculated total costs for the parade.
In Brandenburg, no carnival parades are taking place. The "Parade of the Happy People" in Cottbus, which is probably once again the largest in East Germany, is taking place for the first time after the pandemic. No parades have been cancelled for Swabian-Alemannic carnival either.
Schleswig-Holstein's carnival stronghold Marne is sticking to its traditional parade despite the increased costs. "We are going ahead with our event," says the president of the carnival society, Heiko Claußen. But even here, financial worries are being felt: if more sponsors are not found or the existing ones don't contribute more, reserves will have to be tapped - "that's not possible every year." The current deficit: around 200,000 euros.
And inflation: for sweets, there is a price increase of up to 60 percent, says Elvira Reuther from the Nürnberger Fastnachtszug Support Association. By luck in misfortune, too much was ordered in 2020, which is why there is still enough stock this time. However, it is already certain that the parade will be more expensive. Twice as many people will be needed for security as in 2020.
Anyone standing on the side of the road during the carnival parade in the Rhineland could receive fewer sweets than before. Because sweets have become more expensive, some parade participants have less to give away. Sweets or not, the crowds are expected to be large: "I think that if it doesn't rain that day, we can expect an increased number of people," says Holger Kirsch, the carnival leader in Cologne. "This is due to the fact that there was no regular carnival parade two years ago. The parade is of course irreplaceable."
The festival committee in Cologne is not commenting in detail on the costs. However, the train is generally "deficitary", which is no secret.
The Ukraine Diary: Dreams and homemade vodka
The Ukrainians are not without reason known for their drinking culture. There is domestic beer such as Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lviv. I always discover German beer here. Not Kulmbacher, but other large breweries such as Krombacher or Warsteiner. I can't really tell the difference in taste. The same applies to vodka, which is widely available. They mainly distill it in the villages themselves. They call it Samargon. No one knows exactly how much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics. In Russia, the Minister of Health claimed a few years ago that consumption had fallen by a whopping 80 percent in five years. Well, you can see that you can't really believe the Russians. It is said that tourists should be careful with it. But that only applies if they go to the massive sales. Then they are probably also cheated.
FC Hansa Rostock rewards itself for the high effort: "Match luck on our side"
Food and drink
If you want to celebrate the weekend with a cocktail or have a beer after work, Rostock and Warnemünde have great places for that. The restaurant scene offers many locations for after-work meetings or pre-club parties. Where is the best place? A look at the Google reviews shows it.
Biathlon World Championships: Federal President sees favourite win and praises Oberhof
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender were greeted at the arena by chimney sweep master Tobias Böttger and the Oberhof mascot "Flocke".
Oberhof. The German biathletes had nothing to do with the medal distribution at the World Championship sprint in Oberhof. However, there were two glimmers of light in the fog.
Despite the President's efforts, it was impossible to tell from the VIP stand whether the discs actually fell from the shooting range on Saturday. "I had to get the results on my mobile phone," said Frank-Walter Steinmeier with a smile, and referred to the fog that kept drifting into the stadium, which severely impaired the spectators' view of the race.
Steinmeier nevertheless enjoyed the visit to the 10 km sprint race at the Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof, and received numerous tips from the Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "Since the Olympic Games in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race, I have been fascinated by biathlon," he revealed, and praised Oberhof for its modernized sports facilities: "The newly renovated arena is great and offers ideal conditions. The athletes say so too - with thanks to those who have been working here since the World Championships were awarded here." The location is now "a step ahead" of many others in terms of sustainability and is therefore "safe for the next few years and even decades."
Once again, the Norwegian Johannes Thingnes Bö was the best athlete, despite a penalty lap after a shooting error. He secured his sixth win in the sixth sprint of the winter in 23:21.7 minutes and thus his second world championship title in Oberhof. His brother Tarjei, who shot without errors (14.8 seconds behind) and Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 penalty lap/39.9 seconds) as well as Johannes Dale (1/43.6) completed the Norwegian quadruple victory.
The local ski hunters were unable to get involved in the battle for the medals one day after Denise Herrmann-Wicks triumph. Johannes Kühn, after a shooting error and with a deficit of 1:04.8 minutes, was the best German and took eighth place. World Championship debutant Justus Strelow shot flawlessly and became twelfth (1:14.6). Two glimmers of light behind the grey veil. On the other hand, Benedikt Doll was disappointed again. After his botched mixed entry on Wednesday, the Black Forest dweller this time left five targets standing and disappeared as the 55th, deeply disappointed and without comment, in the cabin.
Bö started the race with number 1 in front of 14,300 spectators and demonstrated this status despite the complicated visibility. However: In his last two standing shots, he had the luck of the skilled; they landed on the edge of the discs and still fell. The 29-year-old then enjoyed the award ceremony together with his five-year-older brother: "It is the best feeling to stand here with him," said the world champion: "We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes".
There is little doubt that the Norwegians will also dominate the pursuit on Sunday. However, the German hopes rest with Herrmann-Wick. "If you start with the number one, the goal is not to finish tenth. There is only full throttle and attack to defend the number one," said Sport Director Felix Bitterling, putting his "locomotive" to the test. The organizers expect an almost sold-out arena for the double event (13:25 and 15:30/ZDF and Eurosport live).
Brych dislikes "bee swarm" on the pitch
Felix Brych - Referee Felix Brych will decide at the referee's ball.
Aggressive players or grumpy coaches? Germany's referees want to "consistently punish" unsporting behaviour. Referee chief Fröhlich points to a role model function.
German top referee Felix Brych has identified negative tendencies in the way players interact on the pitch. "I think there are new behaviours from the players, who surround the referee after decisions a bit like a swarm of bees and try to push him into the review area," said the 47-year-old to the German Press Agency. "We discussed this in the winter break. We decided that we do not want to accept such unsporting behaviour. We will pay more attention to this and will also sanction it."
Two coaches were also given place bans. Mainz coach Bo Svensson was sent off during the cup defeat against FC Bayern. Christian Streich, the coach of Freiburg, was given a red card for the league defeat in Dortmund. "The coach's behaviour also falls into the category of unsporting behaviour. We noticed that unsporting behaviour has also increased in this area, that the behaviour towards referees has become a bit more demanding or aggressive. We also want to punish such unsporting behaviour consistently," said Brych.
DFB referee chief Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed out a fundamentally good relationship between coaches and referees. "Overall, the relationship fits. There are reactions, followed by consistent counter-reactions. The person affected must then live with that. That shouldn't be anything world-shattering," Fröhlich told the German Press Agency.
"Emotions can lead to conflicts in the course of the game. But if the emotions spill over into personal insults, then you have to accept that the appropriate measures are taken by the referee," said Fröhlich. In the recent cases, the participants cleared things up afterwards. "It would only be important if a change in thinking process could be initiated overall, so that such behavior is simply not tolerated," said Fröhlich on the sidelines of an event of the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed out possible effects on a different level. "Of course, incidents from professional football always have an impact. There is a role model effect, which results in imitation. In the most recent cases in the Bundesliga, the referees have reacted consistently to negative behavior," said Fröhlich. "Regardless of the consistent interpretation of the rules in the game, a clarifying conversation, with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those affected, is always helpful."
Combined athlete Oftebro wins in Schonach
The victory was secured by the Norwegian Jens Luraas Oftebro after a jump from the normal hill and the 10 kilometre long cross-country ski race. The Austrian leader Johannes Lamparter came in second. Third place went to Kristjan Ilves from Estonia.
The German Nordic combined team is not at full strength in the Black Forest. Beijing Olympic gold medalists Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel and Johannes Rydzek are not there. They are preparing themselves with training in Oberstdorf for the World Championships, which will take place from 21 February to 5 March in the Slovenian Planica. "We have three world-class athletes at home. The team naturally feels that," said team coach Hermann Weinbuch on ZDF.
Seven people lightly injured in a collision on the A5
Seven people, including two children, were slightly injured in a collision involving four vehicles on the A5 motorway near Hemsbach (Rhein-Neckar-Kreis). According to a police statement, the collision occurred on Saturday when a driver, who was stuck in a light traffic jam, hit a car from behind and pushed it into two other vehicles. The full closure of the lanes in the direction of Heidelberg was lifted after about one and a half hours.
Finissage at the Marl Sculpture Museum
The exhibition was initiated by: the initiators Sebastian Freytag (left) and Georg Elben (right) stand with artist Christian Freudenberger in front of his wall painting.
On Sunday, 12 February, an unusual exhibition will come to an end at the Marl Sculpture Museum. There will be some extras for the finale.
The final event for the exhibition "Wandgebunden" will take place on Sunday, 12 February, at 3 p.m. in the transitional quarters of the Marl Sculpture Museum in Georg-Herwegh-Straße 63-67. In three exhibition rooms, two large-format wall paintings will attract attention.
After the exhibition, the walls will be painted over and the artworks will disappear. However, a catalogue will document the works created specifically for the Marl Museum. It will be presented by the two curators, Georg Elben and Sebastian Freytag, on 12 February.
For the final event, Dr. Friederike Schuler will also give a talk on wall-bound art in the service of the community. Using numerous examples, she will present the special features of wall painting from the Weimar Republic and ask about the connections to this art form in the Federal Republic, with a focus on NRW in the 1950s to 1970s.
Dr. Friederike Schuler is a freelance art historian and curator who completed her doctorate on Weimar Republic wall paintings in 2013. Since then, she has been researching building-related art, as well as the history of art and institutions in post-war Germany. Most recently, she has been researching with Sebastian Freytag on art in construction in NRW. After the lecture, the final curator-led tour of the exhibition will take place. The artists will be present.
Arrest warrants after building collapses in Turkey
It is about construction defects that have favoured the collapse of buildings: in the Turkish earthquake region, the judicial authorities have issued arrest warrants against dozens of suspects.
Istanbul. In the south of Turkey, dozens of arrest warrants have been issued following building collapses during the earthquake. In the city of Diyarbakir, around 33 people have been issued with arrest warrants, reported the state news agency Anadolu on Saturday, citing prosecutors. The accused are said to be responsible for construction defects that contributed to the collapse of the buildings.
The public prosecutor's office in Adana is also investigating possible construction defects in the collapsed buildings, according to Anadolu. As part of these investigations, 62 arrest warrants have been issued so far, it was reported. One of the accused was reportedly arrested at the airport in Istanbul. He was allegedly trying to travel to Montenegro with cash and is now in custody, Anadolu reported. Nine other people were arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.
Early Monday morning, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.7 shook the Turkish-Syrian border area, followed by another earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 in the afternoon. More than 7,500 buildings collapsed in Turkey alone.
Hans Modrow, last but one East German Prime Minister, has died
Hans Modrow is dead, the Left Party in the German parliament announced. The 95-year-old died in the night to Saturday. The chairman of the parliamentary group, Dietmar Bartsch, honored the former SED functionary and later PDS and Left politician as a "deeply sincere socialist."
"Hans Modrow passed away last night at the age of 95," the Left Party in the German parliament announced on Saturday. The party is losing "a significant personality," explained the party's chairperson Dietmar Bartsch and the former party leader Gregor Gysi.
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the 1st secretary of the SED district leadership in Dresden. As Minister President, he accompanied the end of the GDR. Only four days after the fall of the wall, on 13 November 1989, he became the chairman of the GDR Council of Ministers - for around 150 days. At the Volkskammer elections on 18 March 1990, the SED/PDS lost power and Modrow lost his office a month later. He was followed as the last Minister President of the GDR until reunification by the CDU politician Lothar de Maizière.
The chairman of the Left Party, Dietmar Bartsch, described Modrow in a message on the microblogging service Twitter as a "deeply sincere and combative socialist". Bartsch added:
"Right up to his old age he was an important advisor in our party, and his wisdom will be missed."
"The peaceful course of the creation of the German unity was precisely a special merit of his. This will remain his political legacy," Bartsch and Gysi wrote in their obituary.
"His later work in the Volkskammer, the Bundestag, the European Parliament and as honorary chairman of the PDS always consisted in representing even those parts of the former population of the GDR who were not wanted and whose interests were regularly violated."
After reunification, Modrow sat in the German Bundestag for the PDS from 1990 to 1994 and represented it in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
As reported by the German Press Agency (dpa), Modrow viewed the new state "with a certain amount of criticism". German unity was achieved too quickly, the GDR was swallowed up too unconditionally, and it was condemned too one-sidedly as an "unlawful state", Modrow criticised in many interviews, according to dpa.
What happened in the night
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has condemned Russian rocket attacks. Meanwhile, Kiev has to carry out repairs to the power grid.
Kiev - The latest wave of Russian rocket attacks is forcing Ukraine to carry out emergency repairs to its energy network. However, Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions. Several thermal and hydroelectric power plants have been damaged, said the head of the energy supplier Ukrenergo, Volodymyr Kudryzkyj, on Friday evening on Ukrainian television. The situation with the power supply in the Charkiv region is particularly bad. Due to the instability in the Ukrainian power grid, a reactor block had to be shut down at the Chmelnyzkyi nuclear power plant, and production was slowed down at the Riwne and South Ukraine nuclear power plants.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the Russian attack with about 100 rockets and cruise missiles on Friday as terrorism, but in a video message he told his countrymen how much support Ukraine received on his trip to London, Paris and Brussels this week.
Selenskyj does not want to leave the small town of Bachmut in the lurch
On February 24, war will have been raging for a year. US President Joe Biden announced a visit to Poland, an important supporter of Ukraine, shortly before the anniversary. The danger of Russian missile attacks continued in the night before Saturday. In the capital Kiev, an air raid alarm was sounded for the fifth time on Friday evening. "An attack with drones is imminent," the military administration of the Kiev region reported. Combat drones of Iranian design were also seen and shot down over the areas of Mykolajiw and Odessa in the south.
Deutsche Bahn: The Federal Government has chosen consultants for the network company
Demands from the FDP and the Greens, among others, to split it off, failed due to the coalition partner SPD. In the coalition agreement, a compromise was agreed upon for an infrastructure company, which, however, should be geared towards the common good in the future. This means that it does not need to generate profits and distribute them.
Backlog of 80 billion euros in renovations
The two consulting firms are to help the federal government to monitor this process. The backlog of repairs to the rail network is a major reason why Deutsche Bahn is currently running very late. Transport Minister Wissing has made it his mission to eliminate this problem with the complete renovation of entire rail corridors. The investments required for this have been estimated at 50 billion euros, but according to more recent calculations by Deutsche Bahn, they are more likely to be up to 80 billion euros.
Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof 2023 - Gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: "Can someone pinch me, please?"
The external circumstances apparently did not work in Herrmann-Wick's favour. She said she had slept badly, was "totally agitated" and her pulse had not returned to normal even when she entered the arena. "A race like this, and at the home World Championships, is something that cannot be described in words," she said. 11,000 spectators cheered to the pounding schlager music with German flags, and coaches and team members fell into each other's arms.
She had set herself the goal of "enjoying biathlon".
The pressure had been particularly high for Herrmann-Wick. The 34-year-old had started the World Championships as the biggest, if not the only, German medal hope outside of the relay teams. Herrmann-Wick has won two World Cups this winter, and is currently in fifth place in the overall World Cup. And even though the performance density is significantly higher among the women at the top than among the men, where Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegian team currently dominate, there were other names on the list for this sprint victory.
Criticism of the government - Bishop in Nicaragua sentenced to 26 years in prison
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-leaning head of state. He accuses Ortega of suppressing religious freedom. Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been severely strained since 2018, when demonstrators demanding Ortega's resignation took refuge in churches. More than 350 people died in the protests in 2018. Thousands of people left the Central American country in the following years, often out of fear of repression or arrest. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of conspiring with the US government to overthrow him.
Bundeswehr: Arms industry demands more orders from special fund
The first armament projects have therefore already been cancelled, and other projects are threatened with the same fate, as the "Welt am Sonntag" reports. It is not yet possible to say which investments will be cancelled, however. "There is no need to assign specific procurement measures to a possible need for savings at this point in time," says a response from the federal government to a question from the member of parliament Ingo Gädechens (CDU).
The background to the falling investment sum is the rising interest rates. The special fund, which is fully financed by credit and which the German parliament had decided in June 2022, has to bear the interest charges for the loans itself. If these rise, there is therefore less money available for the specific acquisitions for the Bundeswehr. In addition, the current high inflation is reducing the purchasing power of the remaining sum.
Kupferzell: Accident with 3 injured
In the night from Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.), at about 01:40, a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from Kupferzell, wanted to turn left onto the motorway in the direction of Heilbronn at the Kupferzell motorway entrance. At this time, a 21-year-old VW driver was driving on the B 19 in the direction of Künzelsau, as the police reported. During the turning maneuver of the BMW driver, a collision occurred between the two vehicles.
Both parties involved in the accident stated that the traffic lights installed at the accident site showed "green" for them. An inspection of the traffic lights revealed no problems. Further investigations are to follow. The 24-year-old, the 21-year-old and the passenger in the BMW were all slightly injured in the accident. They had to be taken to hospital. The two cars suffered a total of approximately €20,000 in damage.
Stuttgart's Schlossplatz remembers the victims of the earthquake disaster
Many people from Stuttgart followed the call of the Ditib Mosque community in Feuerbach on Friday evening.
Tens of thousands of people have died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria. There is a lot of sympathy - also in Stuttgart.
The earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria is preoccupying the world. On Friday evening, more than 200 people gathered on Stuttgart's Schlossplatz to remember the victims and pray for them.
Many members of the congregation followed the call of the Ditib mosque community in Feuerbach, young and old, women and men. They all listened to the prayer of the imam seriously and in silence. In the prayer, the imam asked Allah for help for the people in the affected areas, so that they could also overcome this catastrophe. He asked, among other things, for health, protection from plagues and for respectful treatment of one another. The congregation also asked for assistance and strength "to bring our help to the areas affected by the earthquake".
Ditib stands by the people in Turkey and Syria. The speakers expressed their sympathy for the victims and the relatives of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the commemoration. The prayers were also translated into German on the Schlossplatz.
Muslims in Germany are showing great solidarity with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border region. The German Islamic Association's Turkish-Islamic Union (Ditib) fundraising campaign has already raised several million euros.
The Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt has collected donations of goods in Glockenstraße over several days, which are to be transported to the earthquake regions by lorry. Even there, the willingness to help was overwhelming.
Hiking with meat filling - Ebersberg
"After eating, you should rest or take a thousand steps"... The older generation knows the proverb, the younger generation simply puts it into practice. In any case, during the pandemic years, the good old digestive walk has experienced an unprecedented renaissance. Because who, thanks to home office, is not sitting in the middle of a desert of stone, but rather just a stone's throw away from fields, forests and meadows, now uses the lunch break either after the quick snack in front of the screen or alternatively for a walk in the fresh air. At least that is the impression around the Egglburger See, where between 12 and 2 p.m. not only dog owners are hanging around.
One reason could of course be that people in modern times, as part of optimal use of time slots, can combine the health-promoting supply of fresh air with other things. After all, why not use a short walk through nature to get news from the settlement from a neighbour you haven't seen in a long time? Or to meet a friend with whom you never make it to the cinema, not even to the Alte Kino? In this way, it is also possible to combine work and private life - who says that the appointment with a tax consultant, lawyer or investment advisor can't take place outdoors? Provided that there are no foreign ears in the vicinity, of course.
What you can also do very well is to buy things. Fresh fruit, for example, which is on a table next to a cheese plate on the side of the road. Or potatoes and meat. The only problem is if you haven't already thought about the purchase and made the appropriate arrangements. An elderly couple in Hinteregglburg leaves the farmer's wooden sales room with empty hands and regret in their voices. "It's a shame, we forgot our money."
One can sympathize with the disappointment, even if one does have a companion with a wallet, but not a means of transport. One should also let the sympathetic acquaintance know. To which the man replies: "That's not true! You do have a bag with you!" And he points to the hood of the jacket, which one quickly put on before leaving the house, even though the sunshine makes an additional head covering unnecessary. "My wife always packs everything in there!"
And so it happens that you start the return journey with a meat dish and, on this midday excursion, you have not only gained a lamb fillet, but also a very practical idea. It is quite possible that a second walk will be necessary that day - after dinner, this time actually for digestion.
Trapped and seriously injured
At around 9 p.m., the 25-year-old was driving his Audi on the Kreisstraße towards Hailfingen when, for reasons that are still unclear, he went off the road to the right in a left-hand bend, according to the police report. The Audi hit a guide post, collided sideways with a tree and came to a stop a few metres away. The driver was trapped in his car as a result of the collision. The fire brigade freed him using heavy equipment. The rescue service took the seriously injured man to hospital. Since there was a suspicion of unfitness to drive, a blood sample was taken. The police report states that the Audi was a total write-off, with damage estimated at 1000 euros.
Donald Trump's tax returns: A point for the rule of law
The US Department of Justice has decided: The financial authority must hand over the tax returns of the former president to parliament.
Trump 2018, still in office as President of the USA
The Treasury Department must order the Internal Revenue Service to release the confidential documents to the Financial Services and Tax Committee, the department said in a decision on Friday.
Contrary to political custom in the USA, the real estate mogul Trump had not made his tax returns public either as a candidate or later as president. He fought against their release all the way to the Supreme Court. A district attorney in New York has now received the documents, but no details may be made public from them - unless a trial takes place.
The release to Congress is more sensitive for Trump: There, the circle of those authorised to access the information is somewhat larger and, under certain conditions, individual details could be published during the course of the committee's investigation. Moreover, confidential information is always leaking out of Congress.
The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, immediately welcomed the decision as a "victory for the rule of law". Access to the Republican's tax records is a matter of national security, she wrote on Twitter. "The American people deserve to know the facts about his conflicts of interest and his undermining of our security as president," Pelosi explained.
Cabaret in the Bastion: Life plays between birth and death
Kirchheim. Pasta or pizza? Samsung or Apple? Which mobile phone contract from the many offers? Stay or break up? Either - or? As slaves of time, people today rush from one appointment to the next, sometimes pushing people and hamburgers in between. Lucy van Kuhl shows in her new program that the "in-between" state has something exciting.
In a humorous and thought-provoking way, Lucy van Kuhl tells and sings about situations from life. In her sensitive chansons and snappy cabaret songs, she gets to the point - and there is a little bit more between the lines. The show starts on Saturday, 18 February, at 8.30 pm in the Kirchheim club Bastion.
British serious criminal caught after long flight in Thailand
London - After five years on the run, a convicted drug dealer from Great Britain has been caught in Thailand. As the British National Crime Agency (NCA) announced on Saturday, the man was arrested by Thai police on Friday in a car workshop in Bangkok. The 55-year-old was on the "Most Wanted" list of the most wanted criminals sought by the NCA.
The leader of the criminal gang fled in early 2018 ahead of a trial in which he was due to be sentenced to 11 years in prison in absentia for attempting to import amphetamines worth £8m ($9m).
Encounters at the church table

Cabaret - Stories from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: The physicist from Lower Franconia, who has been living in Vienna for three years and, according to his own statement, loves the Viennese sense of humor, breaks a lance for science in his cabaret programs. The programmatic title of his current solo, "Make Science Great Again," fits in well with this. Whether this fits well into the generally prevailing domestic skepticism about science is a matter of debate. His humor, however, fits very well in Vienna.
The English title is also derived from Ebert's recent life story, as he tried to make a name for himself as a stand-up comedian in New York in 2019. Now he is back and he tells his German audience not only about his experiences abroad, but also explains what Wissenaft is and what it can do - and what it can't do. Corona is mentioned, of course, but also German thoroughness in the toilet and American engineering.
And he breaks it down to the most important question that many people avoid: What is really important? All of this with a huge wink, unexcited and very ironic. And so, not only are you entertained, but you can also learn something from it.
Please go for typing... it doesn't take long, it doesn't hurt and it can save many people's lives.

Microtransactions in Diablo IV: Blizzard calls out details and prices of monetization <URL> #DiabloIV #ActivisionBlizzard

1. Generalities
The one-man entertainment device BATTLEZONE is equipped with a vector or X/Y monitor. This game illustrates the battle from the perspective of a tank driver. The battles take place in a wide valley, completely surrounded by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley there are rock pyramids and rock cubes that offer the player temporary protection, as they cannot be destroyed by enemy fire.
The opponent is represented by slow moving tracked vehicles and fast super tanks, as well as agile rockets, which are increasingly difficult to hit during the extended game play. In addition, UFOs appear at periodic intervals. These cannot attack the player's tank, but the player can score high points by hitting a UFO. The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) different modes of operation. These are the attraction mode, the game introduction mode, the game mode, the initial input for maximum results and the self-test mode. The latter mode represents a special mode for checking the operating elements and the computer function.
4. Course of the game
Gameplay is initiated when the push-button switch START is activated. The LED switch remains illuminated and the game sounds can be heard. If the last player's tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, the game is over. The game begins with tanks moving slowly, which can be seen on the screen. The player can determine the position of the enemy tanks or rockets by paying attention to the displayed text in the upper left corner of the cockpit. For example, the displayed text could read: ENEMY FROM THE RIGHT. Additionally, a point is visible on the wide-range radar screen, accompanied by a sonar BLIP sound, which represents the enemy position.
The upper, conical area on the radar screen represents the player's field of vision on the screen below. If the opponent is in this area, he can be easily targeted on the screen. At the same time, the message OPPONENT IN FIRE AREA is displayed in the upper left-hand information display.
UFOs appear on the screen for a while, flying over the battlefield. These are harmless missiles that observe the battle and cannot eliminate either the enemy or the player's tank. The flight position of the UFOs cannot be detected by the radar. The UFOs are intended to round out the battle and distract the player, since they usually appear at the same time as enemy tanks or rockets. UFOs can be eliminated by both the player's tank and the enemy's tank. A hit by the player earns 5,000 points. If the player hits an enemy, the following points are earned: 1,000 points for a slow-moving tank, 2,000 points for a rocket, and 3,000 points for a supertank. A supertank moves and turns twice as fast as the player's tank or a slow-moving enemy tank. The game can be played with 2, 3, 4, or even 5 tanks using several options. After reaching certain point values, a bonus tank can be released and the appearance of the rocket can be varied for a more difficult game setup. Details and the exact switch positions for the game setup selection are shown in the illustration.
5. Initial input at the highest results
If a player exceeds the minimum score in the High Score Table, he or she may enter three (3) personal initials into the table at the end of the game. The instructions are self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. Note that when a self-test is triggered, the RESET button is pressed on the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PCB or when the power supply is interrupted, the High Score Table is cleared. When cleared (RESET), the top ten (10) scores with their initials are retained and re-entered on the screen to challenge further players. Any score over 100,000 is marked with a tank symbol followed by the player's initials. If a player does not enter their initials within 60 seconds, the computer will automatically enter dashes. After this, the device will revert to the Attraction game mode. CONSTRUCTION
1. New parts
The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) new components. If you already have experience with ATARI video devices, you should take note of these important differences. The new parts are: A. The control lever. This is a redesign of the ATARI control lever. It has been reinforced by several additional ribs in the inner and outer housing parts, which made this unit more stable and ensured proper functioning of the switch contacts. Another modification is the rubber centering bellows, which, like a centering spring, always brings the control lever back into the center position. The micro switches are now attached with self-locking nuts for easier replacement. B. Two PC boards. ATARI'S X/Y game circuit was expanded to two (2) interconnected boards. These are the analog vector generator and the auxiliary board. With the help of this switching technique, more lines are generated on the screen at a higher speed, resulting in a uniform and smooth image. C. The power supply. The BATTLEZONE is equipped with a newly designed power supply. It has a larger, more powerful transformer to cover the increased energy supply given by the expansion of the circuit. D. The device housing. Due to the new design, it was now possible to install a new cash box with a larger coin acceptance capacity. Furthermore, the device contains a console, which is intended as a podium for smaller players to make playing easier. At the same time, this console guarantees maximum device stability at the installation location.
These new components, as well as all other major assemblies of this unit, are shown in figure 1. Whenever a new part is mentioned in the manual, you will find this symbol. 2. Equipment inspection
After removing the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready to play. However, you should still carry out a certain amount of checking to complete the quality control. The following checks should be carried out to ensure that the device has been delivered to you in a proper condition: NOTE: Do not connect the device to the 220 V mains yet. A. Examine the outside of the housing for any damage. B. Open the maintenance flap of the device and check the components inside the device as follows: (1) Check all cable harness plugs for a correct and secure connection. If necessary, connect any open or loose plugs to each other.
NOTE: Never force the plug connections. The plugs are spring-loaded to ensure a correct connection. A 180 degree twist in the plug connection will destroy the PCB.
(2) Check the plug connections to the game PC board for a correct and secure fit. (3) Check the manufacturing number of the device on the nameplate on the back of the device. Check that the embossed manufacturing number on the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PC board, auxiliary PC board, controller/audio II PC board and TV monitor all match. An image of the location of the manufacturing number is on the back cover of this manual. This number should always be quoted when calling your service provider for further service information. (4) Check all other main components such as the power supply, control console and TV monitor for correct assembly. (5) The device must be supplied with mains power and switched on. Check that the radar screen is in the bright, orange-circled opening in the cover by looking through the player's viewing window. If the opening is not centred correctly, the cover, which is attached to the housing with adhesive tape, must be removed and re-aligned. Before connecting the device to the mains supply, ensure that the voltage selector plug on the mains lead 1 (see fig. 3) matches the local mains voltage. Check the colour of the cable on the plug and check the connection values as listed below:
HAVING TROUBLE WITH YOUR SOFTWARE? The following are a series of tips that may help you solve most problems associated with current DirectX games. Check your system configuration
Please take the time to check that your system meets the requirements listed on the packaging. The DirectX Diagnostic Tool can help you to get an overview of your system if you are unsure whether your PC meets the requirements. To run the DirectX Diagnostic Tool, please follow these steps: Click on the Start button and choose the option to “Run”. Type “dxdiag” into the text field. The DirectX Diagnostic Tool user interface will now be displayed. Here you can access all relevant system details, including information about your graphics and sound card. You can check whether graphics and sound are working correctly by clicking on the appropriate buttons to test DirectDraw, Direct3D and DirectSound. Note: If you do not have advanced computer knowledge, we would advise against changing any of the options in the DirectX Diagnostic Tool.
Other programs may be using up system resources that the game needs to run smoothly. Not all of these programs are obvious, and many start automatically when you turn on your system. These programs, which are always running on your system, are called “background applications”. In some cases, they may be the cause of your program hanging or crashing. Therefore, we recommend that you close or deactivate these background applications before you start the game. To do this, look for the program’s icon in the Windows taskbar, right-click the icon, and choose the appropriate option (“Deactivate”, “Close”, or similar). Once you have deactivated the antivirus and crash guard programs, you should also close all general background applications, as these sometimes cause problems when you install or run a PC game. You can read more about this in the section “How to close all unnecessary background applications”.
Before installing software, you need to ensure that your hard drive is working optimally. Therefore, you should make it a habit to clean up your PC at regular intervals. The tools you need for this are included with Windows: use ScanDisk, Defragmentation and Disk Cleanup to ensure everything runs smoothly. This will increase the chances of current games running largely without problems on your PC. A "clean" system also has the advantage that it works much more efficiently, and thus other applications you use will also run faster and more stably. Consult the Windows Help files to learn about the ScanDisk and Check Disk, Defragmentation and Disk Cleanup tools.
1. Click the "Start" button and select the "Help" (or "Help and Support") option to call up the Windows Help. 2. Now click in the search field and type in the appropriate keyword, e.g. "ScanDisk" (Win 98/ME), "Check Disk" (Win 2000/XP), "Defragment" and "Disk Cleanup". You will then receive instructions that explain how to use these tools.
The game crashes or hangs?
For games that use the latest version of DirectX, you should make sure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card. This can often prevent a game from crashing or hanging. First, try downloading the latest drivers from the website of the graphics card manufacturer. Here are the latest graphics card manufacturers:

Also, be sure to have some notes ready. - PC brand and model - Processor type - Operating system, including version number (e.g., Windows® 98;Windows® Me) - RAM (memory) - Information about your graphics and sound card and drivers
INTRODUCTION TO DRIVING
The desire to develop video games was sparked in me by the advent of 3D real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a whole new range of possibilities and appeared to me as a new means of expression, by means of which one could push the world to its limits. It represented for me a possibility of opening up new horizons. I felt like a cinematic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century: on the one hand, I struggled with the still immature technology, but on the other hand, I was aware that there was still everything to be discovered - in particular, a new language that was both narrative and visual. To be quite honest, the next ten years did not satisfy my hunger. I had the dull feeling that video games only exploited a tiny part of their amazing creative possibilities, because they were too much focused on "action" and forgot about a fundamental element of the human experience: feelings. Meanwhile, technology continued to make rapid progress. Fahrenheit represents my contribution to making video games a true, emotion-conveying means of expression. Although this could of course have happened in a completely different form, Fahrenheit's greatest merit is the fact that it raises real questions and offers concrete answers. Fahrenheit is proof that it is possible to create an interactive gaming experience that is not only based on fighting off abhorrent monsters in dark corridors and collecting ammunition, but also has far more demanding and in-depth content. It is proof that it is possible to tell a story and offer game content without having to sacrifice either the narrative or the interactive elements. I hope that both hardcore gamers and casual players will enjoy this new gaming experience. If you are skeptical about video games, I hope that Fahrenheit will help change your attitude towards them. May other developers also feel the desire to take this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspiration, talent, and ambition. Interactivity is still in its infancy and offers the chance to discover everything anew. Over the past two years, Fahrenheit has filled a large part of our lives and represented an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, in which we were repeatedly forced to question many of the previously unshakable principles. I would be happy if Fahrenheit, similarly to books, films, and songs that have left a lasting impression on you, also does not quite pass you by. David Cage
THE README FILE
The Fahrenheit DVD-ROM contains a ReadMe file that contains the license agreement and updated information about the game. We recommend that you review this file to become aware of any changes that have been made since this manual was printed. To view the file, double-click on the Fahrenheit folder on your hard drive (usually C:\Programs\Atari\Fahrenheit). You can also access the ReadMe file by clicking on the Windows® Start button, selecting "Programs," selecting "Atari," selecting "Fahrenheit," and finally selecting the ReadMe file.
SETUP AND INSTALLATION
1. Start Windows® 2000/XP. 2. Insert the Fahrenheit DVD-ROM into the DVD-ROM drive. 3. If the “AutoPlay” option is enabled, the title screen should appear. If “AutoPlay” is not enabled or the installation does not start automatically, click the Start button on the Windows® taskbar, and then click “Run”. Type D:\Setup, and then click “OK”. Note: If your DVD-ROM drive is assigned a letter other than “D”, use that letter instead. 4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation of the Fahrenheit DVD-ROM. 5. Once the installation is complete, click the Start button on the Windows® taskbar, and then click Programs/Atari/Fahrenheit/Fahrenheit to start the game. Note: The Fahrenheit DVD-ROM must be in the DVD-ROM drive for you to play.

Gameplay
By pressing the corresponding start button, the game is started for one or (with minimum credit 2) for 2 players. It is necessary to try to get a lot of area without crossing the rotating QIX's path and without hitting the wandering SPARX. The game is set up so that a minimum area must be occupied before the next area (round) can be tackled. The red timing lines at the top of the screen indicate the time-controlled SPARX. When the red lines meet, additional SPARX are released. When there is an alarm, the SPARX become SUPER-SPARX and more aggressive. If, while trying to draw your territory, your marking symbol gets into the death spiral, it is destroyed, because you cannot cross your own path or go back. If you hesitate and do not complete your area, a fuse is lit and your marking symbol is destroyed. Two speed settings are available. At a slower drawing speed, the points are doubled. After opening the control panel, the 4 programming and test switches are accessible.
The QIX game is self-checking, providing data and demonstrating that the circuitry and controls are working properly. See "Service Program" for more information. The volume can be adjusted on the volume control (VOLUME) on the Data/Sound PC board.

SERVICE PROGRAM
In general, for programming and testing, the 4 switches located in the device, the self-test button and the LEDs on the video PC board are used.
Programming display. This display is used to select the language (English, French, Spanish, German) with which the address programming and the game work. The "Sub-Test" switch can be used to set the languages. If the desired language appears in green, press the "Test" switch to switch to the next program display. Use display. This display is used to determine the level of difficulty for the game. It can also be used to set a "maximum number of credits" that can be used at the beginning of the game. The text to be changed is set by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch (appears in green), the value for the line is programmed using the "Up" or "Down" switch. Pressing the "Sub-Test" switch several times can reach the factory or basic setting, if the bottom line (RESET line) appears in green, press the "Up" switch. The values are reset, the pointer (so called green line) jumps to the first line, further programming can take place. "Test" always triggers the next program display. "Back" [Reserve High Score Value x 10 000) is used to transfer the high score points to the next program display until "High Score Points so far". This value determines the required number of points/shots that a player needs for his own initials (name) and the score points to be entered on the screen. The "Maximum Number of Credits" determines a coin acceptance limit for the device. If the limit is exceeded, the coin acceptance is blocked if a coin lock is present. This can limit the number of games a player can play. This value is from 1 - 99. It should not be set so close to 99 that when a coin is inserted, the credits cannot be reduced to zero when added to 99. A free play mode can be selected by setting "Maximum Credits" to O. Further programming: "Number of Games": Number of score marks per credit
"Threshold": the percentage level that must be reached to switch to the next round
"Time limit": release for additional Sparx
"Difficulty": Difficulty level of the gameplay
"Attracts tone": no tone at "0" in standby mode
"1" tone also in stationary operation (animation tone) "table model": "0" stationary device
Table device for "1"
The credits per coin are set on the "Insert Coin Programming" display. High Score Program Display (Highest score so far). The score points and initials of the player, including the next 10 score numbers, appear. The values are used to set the high score, which was selected on the previous display (set to "back"). By pressing the "up" button, the initials are set to the standard QIX. By pressing the "test" button, the next program display appears. The "total summary". By pressing the "up" button, it can be set to 0. The following values are recorded: Total credit: The number of credits paid. The total number is not set to 0. If 1,000,000 is reached, the count starts over. The total number can only appear to be 0 if the battery or the W1 connector is removed, with the device turned off. Left coin: The number of coins inserted in the left coin slot. Middle coin: (not available) Right coin: The number of coins inserted in the right coin slot. Credits paid: The number of credits given for coins inserted (coins turned over). Credits granted: The number of credits given by the device. % Free games: Credits granted (Paid + granted credits per 100) Minutes played: The number of minutes played. Minutes won: The number of minutes extended or won. % Free time: Won minutes/minutes played per 100. Average game time in sec.: Minutes played/credits paid + granted. Minutes played.
High Score: The number of times a player has scored high enough to knock other players off the high score list. The values are reset to 0 by pressing the "Up" button. The next program display appears by pressing the "Test" button.
Coin slot programming/normal coin setting. This display allows the operator to select a standard coin setting or program another setting.
If a default setting is provided, the programming is selected by pressing the "Up" and "Down" buttons, while the top digit lights up green on the screen. The size values change with the change of the digit. When the correct setting is reached by pressing the "Test" button, the setting is adopted. If a setting is desired that does not correspond to the default setting, the values can be set by pressing the "Sub-Test" button. After a single press, the top setting digit is set to 0, which means that a custom setting is possible. Since the lower values are unchanged, the programmer can reduce his setting efforts by selecting a setting that is close to his desired values and only changing the values that are not appropriate. Once the setting is made, any new setting to be made can be selected by pressing the "Sub-Test" button. If an unwanted press occurs, the default setting appears. The "Up" and "Down" buttons can be used to increase or decrease the values. The process is ended by pressing the "Test" button. The coin multiplier ("coin unit") indicates how many coin units are given for each coin inserted through an assigned slot. "Coin units" - "credit" indicates the number of units required before a credit is issued. "Bonus" coin units indicates the number of units required before a bonus credit is issued. "Min.-coin" is a value that accumulates credits until a specified minimum amount of coins is reached. In the default setting, this value is not used. CMOS MEMORY FAILURE
If "Memory Failure - Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, which stores all programming, has failed. All values stored in the RAM are reset to the factory default settings. This condition indicates a battery failure or malfunction.
ERROR CHECKING and SETTINGS
Start the testing method. Press the "Sub-Test" switch or the "Self-Test" button (SW 1 near the LED display). All LEDs should light up and the hardware test can begin. The tests and settings can be entered according to the program display. Pressing the "Test" button will display the next program. If a continuous video board test is desired, the "Self-Test" button must be pressed twice so that the video test begins in the auto test mode. With this program, the device will perform the hardware test continuously until it is turned off. If the display shows "Open Coin Door to Test", the program plug J 19, 1 - 2 must be inserted. With the J 19 plug pulled out, the memory is protected and the CMOS RAM video test cannot be performed. Hardware tests: These tests are performed as follows: O = off / I = on / X = test results
The ROM checksum computes the checksum of each video ROM and compares it with the checksum stored for that ROM. If there is a difference, the unit stops and the value of the ROM with the wrong checksum appears on the LEDs. If the checksum ROM is faulty, U 10 is displayed first. If this test is not successful, the next ROM displayed on the LED display must be replaced. The E-PROM memory in a given game can be introduced as a bank (series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROMs. The E-PROM type for each series is selected by the decoding plug (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732). Communications RAM from the video board
The Communications RAM test determines the operational reliability of the memory, which is shared by two processors, by storing predetermined series of numbers in the RAM and then checking whether the storage was correct. LED value: 00 0010 If the Gerät with the above display holds, an error has been detected. If the Communications RAMs fail during the video board test, the error may have been caused by a faulty wiring (RAM) or faults in the data board. To localize the error, remove the data board from P 6 and repeat the test. Failure means: faults in U 3, U 4 or associated power circuits.
Video Board CMOS RAM
After values have been written into another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is tested in the same way as the communication RAM. If the test is passed, all memory locations are set to their previous value. LED value: 00 0011 If the device is holding the above display, an error is present. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the associated circuits or decoding.
Check the video board color RAM by storing predetermined number sequences in the color RAM. These number sequences will be checked for correctness when read back. LED value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, there is a fault. Check U56, U57, and the multiplexers and decoders connected thereto.
Video Board (Display RAM). The Display RAM is tested by writing a pattern on each side. The results of these writes are compared to the original pattern. Any discrepancies cause the program to halt and the LEDs indicate the faulty RAM. If a Display RAM fails, diagnose the problem and replace the RAM. If this fault diagnosis does not indicate a RAM failure (00 0101 on LEDs), it indicates that the next test is started (Data Hardware). The connection to the Data Processor must be present and functional.
Unfortunately disappointing
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. That is also the reason for star number 1. The second reason is that the right jacket arrived without any visible seam defects. BUT I was probably too excited about this jacket, because the disappointment was all the greater. I had oriented myself on the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L. Since it is supposed to fit so tightly and I did not want to fight with an S or M in my upper body... In the end, it would have fit in terms of length and at the waist... the rest was too loose. In addition, the lining material was already distributed all over the place when the package was opened. Simply a shame... It will be sent back: /
Fast delivery and good processing
The jacket looks great. We were surprised by the good workmanship. You can wear it on both sides. We ordered it for our daughter, she is thrilled. She usually wears a 158 and the 36 fits her very well in this case and will probably be worn next year too. We can recommend an order.
Robust quality
I decided to go for the rubber pad c because I always work with wood on the car jack and this is not optimal. Unfortunately, I misjudged and the pad does not fit perfectly. But this is my fault. I then made a slight change so that it fits. The pad looks very robust and you no longer damage the edges. You can use the groove or the entire surface. It worked without any problems. It does not slip anymore. I would buy it again immediately.
Unfortunately too big for under 1 year
The product itself is quite okay, but not for under a year. The chewing surface is just too big for the little mouth. We got it when our son was 7 months old and he couldn't use it because of its size. Now, at 12 months old, we have looked for it again and he can use it. He hasn't been able to bite anything with his few teeth. And if it was in the fridge, it would calm him down a lot.
Quality not sufficient / Unfortunately going down
I was blinded by the sometimes exaggerated reviews. I would like to preface this by saying that I already have two Lowepro backpacks in use. One is a very large one for storing equipment and the other is a rather small one for the most important everyday items that you might want to take with you. Because I have just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the small Lowepro is now too small for me and I need a replacement. I bought this backpack during Prime Day for a really affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and I was actually very happy about this purchase, having read many of the reviews beforehand. When the backpack arrived yesterday, however, disappointment followed: The backpack is not bad for under 30 EUR, that cannot be said. But that it can keep up with the well-known products, which are sold at much higher prices, as many reviews have written... People, that is simply not true! I had really hoped that it was like that, but that is definitely not the case. The padded walls are much thinner and do not offer such protection as my Lowepro. The dividers inside are of a different caliber, much flabbier. Overall, the haptic of this backpack cannot be compared to my Lowepro. The zippers for traveling and the materials of the compartments for small items are not particularly high quality either. Therefore, I have decided that the backpack will be returned. If I buy equipment worth many thousands of EUR, then I have to pay for a decent backpack as well. It seems that quality does indeed have its price here. For someone who does not want to spend much money, the backpack is probably a good choice, but not for me. And it is not that I found the decision difficult. After I unpacked the backpack, I knew after 2 minutes that it would be returned. What I did like was the color inside. Here, you will find your things much faster than with a gray interior. For someone who has different requirements for a backpack, the backpack is probably a great thing, but mine is going back.
Unfortunately disappointed by the third part
So far, I had liked the electric series by E. L. Todd the best, but my opinion was changed with this book. I found the first two books very strong and recommendable and was really looking forward to the third part. In the part, it is all about the feelings of Volt and Taylor and I found it unnecessary to be drawn out. Taylor has been swooning over Volt for so long, finally admits everything and is then like a little child and withdraws?! At the same time, there were inconsistencies, in my opinion, because at the end of the second part, Volt still tried to convince Taylor's ex and did not believe him when he said that Taylor would stand by him and tried to convince the ex that Taylor could not do without him and he had heard it himself. But at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and fights for Taylor. I had hoped that this would be the last part of the series and think that this part is the weakest and also quite unnecessary. I will still read the fourth part and hope that it will finally come out that Taylor's girlfriend Sarah is Volt's ex. This would bring more tension into the story.
Man destroys everything, does not know how to appreciate anything and does not learn to do so! First of all: Sooo bad is the film not, as many write. Of course, the story is totally constructed, and always conceived according to the same pattern F. If you have seen the beginning, you know how the end is. And the message is always the same: Man destroys everything, does not know how to appreciate anything, and does not learn to do so! And that is exactly what the film wants to tell us! How often have I thought about the film (and that although I know it is just a film, and the animals come from the computer): Oh my God, the poor animals, often tears come to my eyes just watching the film. Therefore, Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom is really well made. It is just a pity that man does not understand the message behind the film, and that, although it is a mainstream film. We consistently destroy the animals and the environment and ultimately our planet and ourselves. Out of greed and stupidity and arrogance! No empathy for the environment and living beings: none. 4 stars, because the film is well made, but unfortunately always according to the same principle, otherwise 5 stars would have been in. Nevertheless, well made popcorn cinema.
A quiet, sensitive film
Some people are expecting an 8 Mile-style film. This film is not a Hollywood blockbuster and does not want to be one. This film is above all "French" - it is also quiet, sensitive, empathetic, authentic and makes you cry - if you let yourself be carried away by it and do not expect anything from it that it does not want to be.
Problematic
Taste like Quench from the 90s, about the orange, but that doesn't matter either. 5 days every morning a pack: nothing has changed, but nothing at all. My waist circumference has grown by 12 cm! Bloating like never before! After that, diarrhea 5-8 times a day. Not very helpful, unfortunately, despite immediately stopping, the diarrhea has been there for 1 week. It should be noted that only 2 stars were given for the smaller package size (unfortunately only noticed too late), but for the larger package, full 5? That is very, very strange!
terrible smell and poor result! I dyed my blonde hair into a chocolate brown with an intensive dye in October, in February/March I used this hair dye remover. I used the product twice. The first time I noticed that it stinks terrible! However, there was still not too bad a result, it came out as a sort of chestnut brown (a bit darker). Since I did not achieve my desired result, I used it, as in the instructions for unsatisfactory results, one more time. This time it was a pure waste of time! It made no difference, my hair looked the same as the first try. What was even worse, it still stunk weeks after use. No matter how often I washed my hair, the smell just wouldn't go away.
Highly recommended
I have been taking the tablets for a long time now and always take one tablet every 5 days. My vitamin balance has been in the cellar for a long time due to my work, not enough exercise and an additional long-term illness. I wanted to help my immune system not only through healthy nutrition but also through the intake of vitamin D3 and K2. This works very well. I feel fitter and much better. I sleep better and wake up better. The price is also great because you also have to consider how long you can take the tablets. Absolutely recommended.
Function not entirely perfect!! After using the battery case for 3 months I have discovered the following major defects which I find very annoying: 1) The case has problems connecting to the phone over time. This means that the battery is no longer charged even though the "Power On/Off" button has been pressed for 3 seconds. When you remove the phone from the case and put it back in, the problem is solved in 70% of cases, but this creates a new defect. 2) Frequent removal and re-insertion of the phone into the case has caused the cover to wear out to the point that it comes off the case by itself, which is why I have almost lost it several times. These are not many major defects, but I think that a case with a battery should function perfectly in terms of its function, which is why I am very disappointed with the product, especially since I have only been using it for 3 months for the cost of 30€.
Viei too expensive, too thin and disappointing
I don't know how these good reviews came about. In the end, it's actually a glass cleaning cloth that you get as a gift from every optician in a slightly smaller form. The cleaning effect is as good as a kitchen towel and not better. I expected a lot more from these cloths. It's also very thin. Unfortunately, I can't exchange it anymore since I've used it. I'm disappointed and can't recommend it from my side. The price for these cloths is far too high. More than 2 euros should not be given.
I doubt the frequency response
I bought this speaker for the shower, when my smaller free speaker, which I got as a promotional gift, unfortunately broke. Basically, the Onforu works great, is waterproof (I accidentally fell into the shower with it), gives bass like bass, Bluetooth works great... The suction cup must be watered, otherwise it will dissolve... it can reproduce sound very loudly... yes.. what I see critically is the frequency response of this small speaker. As I said, bass is reproduced as bass and not converted into a higher frequency. However, this causes a problem. Some frequencies are reproduced very loudly, while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of the singing are almost painful in the ears, higher and lower frequencies are just good enough to be audible. My old speaker did not reproduce bass well as bass, but the frequencies were represented in the volume quite naturally. With the Onforu, this is unfortunately not really the case, which I find a bit annoying. Therefore, I have to take off one star. I expected more from the frequency response.
very poor
In a few places the paint was flaked off and if you just walked over it with your hand the paint came off in the same place. We wanted to have them pick it up for free because we didn't want it anymore, but unfortunately only at our expense. They would only replace the damaged parts but as if both the cabinet was damaged. Poor service from the manufacturer Amazon has taken care of everything for us and refunded us the money. A LOB to Amazon
Spend a little more money
The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in the quality. The delivered parts have to be glued together by yourself. The product was packed in a simple envelope made of thin cardboard. There was no further protection. Since the postman stuffed the product right into my mailbox, a few templates were damaged. I did not complain, because I urgently needed this product. The glue that was delivered hardly holds, but sticks well - like chewing gum that does not harden. Already one day after gluing, almost half of the templates fell off the wooden sticks. Since the glue does not dry out (at least it was still not dry five days after gluing), one has to be very careful that everything does not stick together. The templates are partially incomplete. For one-time use and as a gag for a party it is okay, but at a wedding I would invest a little more money and opt for a high-quality product.
I am not unhappy. The cabinet looks good and is easy to assemble, even if the instructions are not that clear. + Magnetic lock + nice look + stable when assembled + shelf can be positioned as desired
- Doors slamming due to magnets (this can perhaps be compensated with rubber bumpers) - some dirty spots
- the supplied dowels are much too small and wobbly (I didn't have any others and I didn't have a trophy at home, so I glued them in place with craft glue) - the brackets for the shelf wobble a bit (I wrapped them in paper and leveled them) Conclusion: If it didn't look so good and if it didn't have such good measurements, I would give fewer stars, because you have to make everything fit to be really satisfied. I also think it's a bit too expensive for that.
I like the coffee... but
...there are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, but I think the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive). In this respect, I would have given 5*. Unfortunately, the coffee does not run through evenly (if at all!). The additional plastic waste (individually packaged, see photo) means a star deduction for me. I hope the manufacturer changes this and scores full points soon.
Set the alarm for me.
The alarm clock came quickly and everything is easy to set up. But: the natural sounds sound terrible and are extremely loud. I couldn't make them quieter either. It's probably a defect, supposedly it's possible. The quietest radio setting was also too loud for me, I would fall out of bed immediately. In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can cast shadows on the wall with your hand. I always woke up when I turned my face towards the alarm clock, because I thought it was already tomorrow. When it was actually time, it was suddenly too bright. I liked the colors and the color change, but unfortunately you can't dim the colored light. I also liked that it has a battery, so that you don't have to re-enter the time and the alarm time in case of a power outage. But I went back for the reasons mentioned.
Light is great, processing is not
I replaced four light bulbs in the house with these lamps. Unfortunately, I could only replace four, because the other two were delivered without a socket - instead, a circuit board is laughing at me at this point... There was also nothing in the box. "6 pay - 4 receive" is not a good deal. Amazon would certainly have resolved this kindly and quickly, but I only discovered this after the return deadline. So, I see this as my mistake and I live with it. Nevertheless, it is not a good indication of the quality of these light bulbs - so far the only reason for two stars deduction. The light itself is super. The rooms are now very bright and evenly lit. The light color is more in the direction of cold white. Perfect for hallway, office, workshop, laundry room, etc. For living rooms, I personally would choose warmer light. Definitely comparable to a good old 100 watt bulb. Other lamps can also do this and maybe I will get intact specimens corresponding to the order. If my review helps, I am happy about a positive rating. I try to answer questions quickly.
Tolle
I have received gestures and I would like to share my first look. Yes, positive. I have been thinking for a long time whether to order this set or not. **The material is stable and it lies well in the hand. **The utensils all have a hole at the handle to be able to hang them ** The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is especially practical to use on pans with a coating. ** They are heat-resistant and can be used up to 440 ℉. ** They also do not transfer heat and can therefore be touched directly. ** The dishwasher sometimes leaves water stains on the black silicone, but after a quick wipe they are gone. Finally, I have to say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend
Selling new goods as used goods
Amazon Prime delivery is just great. Delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, unpacked the faucet and checked all the parts. We found out that the part had already been installed. We had to check for scratches and scrapes on all the mounting parts. The screw connections/hose connections were all damaged. Nevertheless, we installed the part in the washbasin (unfortunately). Only now did we see that there were scratches/streaks on the chrome-plated faucet itself. This part had probably already been delivered and sent back. We are keeping this faucet and installing it in the washbasin in the basement because it doesn't matter how it looks. Our conclusion; we will never order such goods via Amazon again, but we will rather spend a little more at the hardware store where we get decent goods. I just find it sad that customers are being ripped off like this!
The product itself is top, but the external sensor is already broken after 6 months
In principle, I am very satisfied with this product. The installation went very easily, and the radio range is very good, and there are no problems with the transmission from the inside to the outside. I also find the design of the device appealing. It is kept very simple and can be mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use, the device that measures the values outside seems to be broken. The thermometer still seems intact, however, and still shows plausible values. The hygrometer, on the other hand, is probably broken, because it always shows completely astronomical values for the outside air humidity. This is very unfortunate, as the device was mounted outside in a protected place, and this is also the reason why I only give this product two stars.
Strong mower with weak catcher
Apart from the fact that the first delivery attempt is still merrily driving around the republic with Hermes, without finding its way to me or back to Amazon, the service from Amazon with the triggering of a replacement delivery was as always excellent. The lawnmower arrived quickly and made a good impression. The motor is strong and it produces a nice cut. The noise level is not particularly impressively low, but it is ok. The big downside is unfortunately the grass box. Firstly, it is only made of hard plastic at the top and bottom and of fabric in between. If you just set it down for a short time when it is full, it will of course be compressed and parts of the contents will fall out. But worse is that the practical fullness indicator shows red as soon as the grass box is half full. This would not be so bad if the lawnmower did not then lose large parts of the cut grass. Emptying the grass box every time it is half full on a large lawn area is not the solution. Therefore, I have cleaned the device as well as possible and sent it back. Conclusion: In principle, this is a very good lawnmower, but the unfortunate construction of the grass box makes it unusable for me.
Good device for monitoring
I have two of these devices. The device can be easily integrated via the app. The supplied insertable sensor cable is very good and can be extended if necessary. The device is solidly built. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but to save battery life, only once to three times a day (adjustable) are displayed in the app. For the following reasons, I give only 4 stars. - The soft back of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, can only be closed again quite clumsily. - One of the two devices is in a room with quite thick walls. This device loses connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device does not connect again by itself, even if you put it near the router. You have to remove the batteries and put them back in after a short pause, then it connects again. This should work without removing the batteries. There is always an alarm when the connection is lost. - The alarm tone could be a bit louder.
3D Printer Prusa i3 DIY
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I have not been able to level the hotbed properly to this day. The right rear locking screw is completely tightened, but the hotbed is still too high in the back and the screw in the front right is almost falling out, even though it is not tightened at all, even though the hotbed is still too low. The rods that hold the carriage are straight, as is the table. Maybe someone knows what to do about this, because it is impossible to print anything. For assembly: The assembly was quite problem-free, but one could show how to lay the cables, because otherwise one has to lay them again and again, which is very exhausting. I have already written to the support, but after a week of waiting, I still have not received an answer. Unfortunately, I can no longer send it back. I had expected a little more.
Robust and precise, I am positively surprised
Unfortunately, my old measuring slide has given up the ghost after many years, so a new one had to be purchased. This one here gives a very robust impression and is just as precise after several test measurements. Two batteries are included, so you can start right away. The packaging of the slide is simple, but it fulfills its purpose. Otherwise, the slide leaves no wishes unfulfilled and has all the necessary measuring methods. I can only give it full points and believe it will last at least as long as the old measuring slide. There is a clear recommendation to buy it and a good measuring instrument belongs in every household.
Disgusting, persistent odor
I bought the bracelet and did not wear it for a while because it emitted a disgusting smell. To this day, the smell has not gone away, even though it was "aired" constantly. After it was no longer possible to return it, I got rid of it. I would not recommend buying it.
For the price, it's ok
The stars and balls on this necklace are a bit too big for my taste, so it looks quite massive. The larger balls are free to move, which I find quite nice. However, the necklace is made of very simple materials, so I have already ripped the closure twice. So far, I have been able to repair it every time, but I think that won't last long. But for the low price, you can't really expect anything high-quality.
Very nice piece of jewelry
A beautifully crafted bracelet - and the simple clasp actually holds! You just have to pull the end through the mouth, it cannot come undone, amazing! I have rubbed it with some leather care, which makes it even softer and more comfortable. Just one thing: if you have something magnetic on your arm: the clasp is made of steel!
Unfortunately, it is junk! I was already disappointed after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that it was used goods. The base station was okay. Now to the function: it only connects after some play around... if you stick to the instructions, it does not work at all, only after I removed a battery from the base station and put it back in did the transmitters finally connect. Unfortunately, my joy about that did not last long, because after only an hour the connection was gone again, and that even though the transmitters were next to the base station. The display of the three transmitters was also very different! All in all, it is not worth using for me! The thing went back! I would definitely not recommend buying it, it only causes trouble!
Transport damage
Hello, I had this garden pump before, unfortunately the thread of the internal shaft had rusted after 3.5 years. I bought it again because I urgently needed it due to the current drought and I knew the connections of the suction line and the discharge line would fit. I hope that the shaft of the previous pump had a production error and that the new pump will last a little longer. Unfortunately, the new pump had transport damage, the plastic housing was torn and the ventilation slots were broken. The box was also damaged from the outside, which is why I would recommend packaging the pump a little better in the future, rather than just using a thin-walled box. I kept the pump anyway, because as described above, I urgently needed the pump and the cracks in the plastic housing did not affect the pump's performance.
It could have been better thought out. Since I often have to deal with many different keys, I thought that an organizer would be more pleasant than running around with a huge bunch of keys all the time. At first, everything went quite well. However, the finish soon wore off and the screws had to be tightened again and again. It's nice that it works with a penny, but only with a penny. I couldn't find a slotted screwdriver that wouldn't ruin the whole screw immediately. Now, to come to the most annoying thing about the whole thing: attaching the keys. It's nice that you can adjust the screw to different sizes or lengths through the different parts, but once you've screwed it all together, you need pliers to take it apart again. Attaching the keys is simply a game of patience, balance and dexterity. Finally, the third time I assembled it, the screw broke in the thread and the whole thing became unusable. Conclusion: If at all, then only for all the necessary keys once and never again, but at that price, you can also buy a cheaper alternative.
Not quite the size stated
Easy-to-use zippers, the material looks robust and everything is lightweight. Since I don't have any comparisons (my first organizer set), I will only be able to actually judge the product after the first use. Before that, I can already say that the height is lower than stated. At the moment, I can't really imagine packing everything there for a three-week vacation, for example. If necessary, the really big parts can go directly into the suitcase - just like before. It should also be noted that 10 parts were delivered, not 8, since two smaller bags/tubes were included in the round cosmetic bag. The processing is not of high quality, but I wanted to mention that anyway. The fact that the cosmetic bag has a different color and is made of a different material than the other bags doesn't bother me personally. I see the price-performance ratio as a trial price and that's okay.
So lala
So, I ordered it before Christmas and it worked until after Christmas. Now, when I wanted to use it again, it didn't work. Battery? Changed. But it still doesn't work. So, I could have thrown the money straight into the trash can.
Care is always good! The application is simple, but you should be very careful with the brush to not damage the needle. I could not hear any improvement in sound with my very high-quality turntable.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. Two black cables were included. The battery life is very long. The sound is definitely completely adequate. I liked that the headphones do not hurt even after wearing them for a long time and are therefore very comfortable. The ear cups are totally soft and pleasant to wear. The weight is also kept very low. Purchase recommendation in this price class.
nice dress
Very nice dress, which is very wearable for a variety of occasions.. Price-performance ratio is completely right, especially since I also got it in the flash sale. It fits perfectly in my size, I am glad that I did not order it smaller (it was recommended). I only wished that the neckline was not so deep, and the sleeves could handle a bit more fabric (if you do not have quite as thin upper arms as the model in the picture). But all in all, a nice dress for many occasions.
Keep your hands off it. It can't get any worse. I really and truly did not expect such rubbish to be sold today. The drive is operated on a High End Asus ROG Strix Scar II Gaming Laptop. It is to be expected that the USB ports supply sufficient power. Nevertheless, it is not possible to operate this drive without any problems. DVDs work normally, but Blu-rays are recognized at most unreliably. The discs have to be inserted multiple times, and then it makes the same noises as you haven't heard since the 90s from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives. After a few minutes, you can either restart the computer because it won't work anymore or the disc is finally recognized. But then you absolutely must not press pause or jump to a chapter or change the language during the film or even just do something. This immediately leads to an unfixable freeze. In addition, of course, no Blu-ray software is included. If you additionally buy PowerDVD or similar at a cost, the price of this drive doubles.
It does what it's supposed to do, but it's not pretty. First of all, I want to emphasize that the two USB ports are actually a sham, because only the port that faces up is a USB port. The other plug is only there to charge some device and is therefore relatively useless. I didn't know this when I bought it, which is why I was a little disappointed. I actually needed a second port and if I had just needed a plain extension, I certainly wouldn't have bought this unsightly lump with gold plugs. But apart from the appearance and my misjudgment, the extension fulfills its duty very reliably. And because of the weight of the plug, the USB stick that's plugged in doesn't just dangle around in the area, like with a normal extension cord. So it wasn't a real bad purchase, but my euphoria is kept within narrow limits :-).
Small but oho! I bought this product so that I could have an audio output on the iPad (Pro) as well as connect a display. With IOS 12, you can now also push data back and forth. This works very well. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Other adapters that I also had to send back were unfortunately not able to do this. The HDMI output is practical. I now have a PS4 controller via BT on the tablet and the HDMI on the TV. Charging at the same time is no problem. The sound is delivered via HDMI. What else do I need my PlayStation for: P. There was a small adapter that can be attached to the tablet. This is supposed to bring stability and also has a magnetic holder. My case does not fit with the adapter. Well, it holds securely and has contact anyway... All in all, it is a bit expensive, but justified by the full range of functions. In addition, it is very small and made of a stable piece of aluminum. Price performance fits.
A lot of performance
Top device. Runs without problems for months. It is not exactly light or quiet, but it delivers a lot of power. I find the middle temperature setting (Tp setting) a bit too cool and am therefore always on level 2. It has also fallen onto the tiled floor several times and has survived well. And I also like the simple design. Competitor products sometimes look like spaceships.
Very good
The processing of the brush head left a very good impression, although the price difference compared to the original is very large, but it does not give a cheap impression. In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed. Overall, I found these brushes very good and can be recommended without reservation.
Great product with weak battery
We have had the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised. In live mode, the tracking is accurate to 0.5m. However, when the dog is in the house, it sometimes jumps a few meters, but this is not a problem. I would buy it again anytime. What would be great, however, is a battery that lasts longer. Currently, it lasts about 1.5 hours. A solution that could last 7-14 days would be great. There is an XL version, but unfortunately, it is too big for our taste. The battery would not even have to last that long and we would find it impractical to have to change it every day. You should be busy with the dog, not with his collar:-). The app also worked perfectly.
After a few weeks of rubbish
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They fit well and seem comfortable too. However, the lifespan is decreasing. Although my son only wears the shoes in PE, the soles are already falling apart after a few weeks and the shoes cannot be used any longer. With the last pair, it was the same in normal use, that they did not last very long, but I thought that would be enough for PE. Unfortunately, that was not the case. The shoes are expensive rubbish and absolutely not recommended.
Fits perfectly - but original? My last pair of Crocs unfortunately broke after 5 years, so I ordered new ones with pleasure. These ones are unfortunately poorly made at first glance. They are just as comfortable as the ones I had before. At first glance, there seems to be no difference, but upon closer inspection, one can see that the edges are poorly made and the strap at the heel fits rather loosely and will probably not last five years like my previous ones. I am curious!
Surprisingly good
Since there are hardly any reviews to read yet, I was very skeptical at first. However, since I am going to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I ordered them on a whim. The delivery included the mattress and a car air pump. As for the mattress: I tested it out in my car (Citroen Berlingo) and noticed that there was some mold on one side. I wiped it away and hope that it doesn’t come back. After it was pumped up, I immediately conducted a lying test. It is very comfortable to lie on and fits perfectly for the festival. Of course, this mattress cannot replace your own bed, but for days at the event, it is pure luxury. The mattress fits perfectly in my car. Beforehand, we removed the seats in the back. It fits perfectly. The air pump: The air pump has different adapters. The mattress requires two different adapters, which can also be found on the pump. The pump is plugged into the cigarette lighter of the car. However, the plug was defective (something to do with the soldering). My boyfriend is handy, so he was able to fix it and reassemble it. The part worked great and pumped up the mattress in no time at all. Overall, I am very impressed with the mattress. I am looking forward to the hardness test at the festival. I hope that it does not lose air and lasts a long time. I also hope that the mold does not come back. After the test, I can already recommend it. If I have any other experiences, I will revise the review accordingly (if possible).
Definitely not worth more than 10€... Unfortunately, the calendar only gets two stars from me. :( 1. For the fast shipping. 2. For the idea of the toy. Unfortunately, the calendar is torn through the cheap processing directly on day 1 through several doors. On the 21st door, there were no more doors left and I had to more or less allow my son to also take out the remaining parts because they were already coming along. The parts often come out mixed up, which often means that you have to take the car apart again to bring the parts together. After the car is completely built, parts fall off during play. (Mostly the windshield. This is also very difficult to put back on again.) In itself, I would not buy this calendar again and would not recommend it to anyone else. Maybe the manufacturers will reconsider the way they designed the calendar for the next edition and make it better. :\
a real drone
I am thrilled with the drone. My 7 year old daughter flies it. It flies very well indoors and the 5 minute flight time is usually more than enough. I didn't expect hair to get caught in it and for the drone to break very quickly, but crashes from the ceiling to the floor, whether it's tiles or carpet, are no problem. If you have any questions, the contact is nice.
Game is ok but only playable with force to Steam. I didn't see when I bought it that it was not a game CD but only a code with which you can download the game. That would be okay so far, but you are forced to install Steam in order to play the game at all, which is an outrage. Since then, the computer has been constantly crashing, which would not be the case with a pure installation of the game.
Unfortunately, it fails due to the battery runtime
I was really looking forward to the watch. The design and look are great, messages etc. are displayed without any problems. The operation works well.... and yet I am sending it back. The big catch: the battery and its runtime. Charged in the evening, just laid on the shelf overnight and in the morning 11% less battery when not in use. If many messages come in during the day, the battery is already dead by noon / early afternoon and then you can't even read the time. Therefore, not useful for me. Very unfortunate.
Luxurious shell with limitations
For the sleazy Samsung Galaxy S10+, you should definitely get a case. Recently, I have been liking cases that you can also put your credit card in. This case offers that. If you put cards in all three compartments, it will be too much, then the lid will stand up a bit. One is enough for me. The leather case gives a robust impression and seems to be well made. It looks elegant. The phone is embedded around it, only the ports have cutouts. Otherwise, you can easily operate the power button and volume control on the sides through the case. The disadvantage is that it is not possible to charge the phone on some QI chargers because of the thickness of the case. Even on the leather QI charging station from TORRO, it does not work. Therefore, you can only charge the accessories - such as the Galaxy Buds - if the case is off. Otherwise, it looks really cool and well made!
High-quality case with bulletproof film
The robust case with a real bulletproof glass as a screen protector in a classic design offers all-round protection for the entire iPhone 11. It fits very well and can also be put on easily. The material is pleasant to hold and does not get dirty. A really successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio. This case gives the phone some stability. It is not too bulky and fits firmly on the phone. Overall, a good purchase.
