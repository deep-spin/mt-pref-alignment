Diego Cocca is the new national coach of Mexico
In the summer of 2026, Mexico will host the World Cup together with the USA and Canada, with a total of 48 teams for the first time. Cocca is taking over from Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not extended after the early exit from the World Cup in Qatar. The 50-year-old was not one of the favorites for the position until a few days ago. He only took over as coach of the Mexican club Tigres in November. His surprising appointment as national coach caused unrest in the club.
Geesthacht: New bed signs are intended to encourage replanting
Franko Stein (FD Environment, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) place the plant signs in the flower beds of the pedestrian zone.
The "Geesthacht blüht auf" (Geesthacht is blooming) campaign also includes information about what is currently blooming there - currently in white and pink.
Geesthacht. "Geesthacht is blooming" is an action of the Nabu in cooperation with the city administration. Since 2015, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been planted with the help of many volunteers from clubs, schools, kindergartens, companies and institutions. The goal: large-scale flower islands should arise in the Geesthachter city area, where insects can find food at any time. "With favorable weather conditions, the bees are already flying out in January to look for food," says Friedhelm Ringe from the Geesthachter Nabu. He has beehives on his property himself.
So that the project does not remain just an action by nature conservationists and the city's environmental department, but rather spreads to private gardens, explanatory signs are placed next to the plants. There are currently around 50 signs. Passers-by should be able to find out this way what is currently blooming. The hope is that amateur gardeners will deliberately plant the same species at home.
In the first week of January, the wild hazel season had already started.
More recent are shrubs such as Winter Sweet and Snowball in the flower beds of the pedestrian zone. They have been in the soil of the containers on Bergedorer Straße for a year now, and are just showing their first delicate white and pink flowers, which are bare of leaves. They have recently been marked with additional signs. "The Winter Sweet is a very bushy shrub and can grow up to two meters high and three meters wide," it says there, among other information about the appropriate location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that not only the bedding plants are now showing flowers. In the first week of January, the wild hazel had already started to bloom. It blooms particularly abundantly on the Richtweg at the ascent, in the Gutenbergstraße, Wilhelm-Holert-Straße, Fahrendofer Weg and many other places.
Ernestine is 102 years old: "Hiking keeps me young"
Munich - Dance god Fred Astaire would surely be proud of them if he were to look down from heaven to Munich's Ostbahnhof!
That's because three ladies meet there every Monday at 3 p.m. in the "Mandolin Motion Show Academy" for a lively step dance - together they are an incredible 277 years old, sorry, young!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, who recently celebrated her 102nd birthday.
For the native Munich resident (born on 15 January 1921) from Schwanthalerhöhe, Monday is the highlight of the week. "Dancing and stepping are my life, I can't imagine it any other way".
Ernestine is also joined by Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) who are also swinging their dancing legs.
The 97-year-old was born in Jena (Thüringen) in 1926. She was a soubrette, today we would call her a musical performer, and worked with the legendary Marika Rökk. "I have spent my life dancing, acting and singing."
At 79 years old, Elfriede Widmann is something of a baby in the circle of stepp dancers. She says: "We're just having fun with our dance teacher Sissy Engl".
Wikipedia: Stepptanz was developed in the United States in the 19th century and is now known all over the world. With two metal plates attached to the front and back of the shoes, which are more durable than the wooden soles initially used, rhythmic sounds are produced when dancing, which match the visual impression and the music. The dancer thus becomes a percussion musician. The English expression for this is tap dance and the French claquettes. The Spanish Flamenco may have influenced the Stepptanz. In this case, the tips of the shoes are nailed so that they produce a well-audible sound when dancing.
The 77-year-old Sissi Engl is the heart and soul of the dance studio at Ostbahnhof. She is an actress, dancer and choreographer. "We are a big family, where everyone is welcome, young and old alike".
And what is the recipe for such a long life? "Movement keeps me young," the 102-year-old says to BILD. Her advice to everyone: "Sport, healthy eating, and no alcohol."
Analog in the dialogue - The limits of the digital
With the ongoing digitalization, the desire for analog is growing again in some quarters.
The speed with which our everyday lives have become digital has left us little time to establish rules for dealing with it and adapt our communication and working methods to it, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden. If you wanted to have a telephone conversation in Bautzen in 1985, there were three options. Either you were one of the lucky six percent who had a private line, or you knew someone from this exclusive group in your neighborhood and could call your relatives there for a bottle of Radeberger. Or you would look for a telephone booth. The smell of the plastic receiver and the sound of the coins in the machine are unforgettable. My biggest dream was to be able to see the face of the other person when I called - video telephony, I thought, what a great thing that would be!
What next in Moldova? 14 days for a new government
In Moldova (also: Moldavia), President Maia Sandu has tasked former Interior Minister Dorin Recean with forming a government.
The 48-year-old economic expert now has 14 days to do so. Recean was previously one of the advisors to the president.
After only one and a half years in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita resigned unexpectedly. The pro-European head of government was under massive pressure, as she herself announced as an explanation for her resignation - apparently she was being attacked by pro-Russian forces.
The president thanked Gavrilita for her "enormous sacrifice".
Moldova is a neighboring country of Ukraine and is suffering from the economic consequences of the war. Inflation is over 40 percent and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the parliament in Chisinau, the pro-European party PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity), founded by President Sandu, has a comfortable majority, occupying 63 of the 101 seats. The confirmation of the new head of government and his cabinet should therefore not pose a problem.
However, pro-European politicians have lost popularity in Moldova in recent months, while pro-Russian politicians - with support from the Kremlin - have become more popular.
These were the costumes of the celebrities
In 2023, there will be a big celebration in Veitshöchheim again. The fifth season is in full swing and the celebrities were not slow to respond.
The father of the land, Markus Söder, did not come as Moses, as suggested by his costume. He sees himself more as the tribal elder of Bavaria, with his wife Karin Baumüller-Söder by his side.
Bavaria's Minister for Environment and Consumer Protection, Thorsten Glauber, chose the children's hero Chase from the Paw Patrol for his costume.
From the depths of the sea to Franconia came Justice Minister Georg Eisenreich with his wife Anja.
Completely detached: Minister for Science and Art, Markus Blume, is drawn to space.
The president of the state parliament, Ilse Aigner, chose none other than "Mama Bavaria" as a model for her costume.
In peace and love mode: Bavaria's Minister of Health Klaus Holetschek with his wife Birgit.
Bob the Builder, aka Building Minister Christian Bernreiter, with his wife Ann-Kathrin Jandt-Bernreiter as Wendy.
Bavaria's golden boy: Finance Minister Albert Füracker with his wife Evelyne. She wore silver.
He even plays the sheriff during carnival: Bavaria's Minister of the Interior, Joachim Herrmann, with his wife Gerswid.
At the ball: Economic Minister Hubert Aiwanger pays homage to the craft industry with his costume. His partner Tanja Schweiger, district administrator of the Regensburg district, does the same.
The political opposition was of course also not to be missed.
Everything for Bavaria: Green Party leader Katharina Schulze as Bavaria and her co-leader Ludwig Hartmann as the Bavarian lion.
The SPD faction leader enjoys hiking: Florian von Brunn with SPD state chairwoman Ronja Endres.
Royal was it for FDP party leader Martin Hagen. He and his wife Anisha came as Harry and Meghan.
Otherwise, he would certainly say more. In Veitshöchheim, the group chairman in the EU Parliament, Manfred Weber, was on his way as a pantomime, with Mrs Andrea at his side.
If it doesn't work out with politics, he can always put on a magic show: Nuremberg's mayor Marcus König as Harry Potter and his wife Anke as Hermione.
Fast as quick as a bee: Bavaria's Digital Minister Judith Gerlach.
Back to the 1920s: the legal director of the BR, Eva Majuntke, BR Director General Katja Wildermuth and BR Culture Program Director Björn Wilhelm.
A small dig at the climate activists from the Franconian Tatort detective Sebastian Fleischer, played by Alexander Leopold Schadt.
The First Mayor of Veitshöchheim was of course also present. Jürgen Götz and his wife Julia.
Oberhof: Kühn eighth in the World Cup sprint
Bö continued his impressive run despite difficult conditions and also won the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic champion has now collected 14 World Championship titles and is closing in on his compatriot Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, who is a TV expert on site, is still the undisputed record champion with 20 World Championship gold medals. Even heavy fog did not prevent the long-time champion Bö from collecting his second gold at the Rennsteig. On Wednesday, it was enough for Norway's mixed relay team to successfully defend their title.
Hardly anyone doubts that number three will follow in the hunting race. In the pursuit, Bö is once again the clear favourite. His running form is outstanding, so he can compensate for shooting errors to a certain extent in a frighteningly simple way.
Meanwhile, things were not going well for Doll. After the veteran had given up all chances of a medal in the mixed relay with a penalty lap, and only managed sixth place, things did not improve three days later. Three penalty laps in prone shooting and two more in standing were a great disappointment for the oldest member of the German team, who had celebrated the greatest success of his career in this discipline in 2017.
Six years ago, he won in Hochfilzen surprisingly with a lead of 0.7 seconds, just barely ahead of Bö. It was one of only three career successes for Dolls, who so far this winter has only once stood on the podium. The eighth-place finisher from the Olympics in Beijing left after his weak performance without saying a word and initially did not give any interviews. Roman Rees managed to place 19th, and the second World Cup debutant David Zobel came in 35th.
Biden receives Lula: "We must stand up for democracy"
At a meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the focus is primarily on the value of democracy. Both look back on their predecessors.
During a visit to his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, US President Joe Biden emphasized the importance of maintaining democratic values.
"The strong democracy of our two nations has been put to the test," said Biden on Friday in the White House in Washington. "We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that are at the core of our strength." Lula responded with regard to his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro: "Brazil has isolated itself for four years."
The left-wing politician Lula had prevailed over Bolsonaro in a run-off election at the end of October. On January 1, Lula took office. The change of power was accompanied by violent riots. Bolsonaro's supporters had stormed the Congress, the Supreme Court, and the government headquarters in the capital city of Brasilia in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil reminds us in a dark way of the storming of the US Capitol just over two years ago, when supporters of then-President Donald Trump violently entered the parliament in Washington.
Lula criticized Bolsonaro openly during the meeting with Biden. His predecessor did not give much importance to international relations. "His world began and ended with fake news, morning, noon, and night," said Lula. "That sounds familiar to me," replied Biden - an obvious reference to his predecessor Trump.
Short note about the press - Friday
Does anyone still remember the RAF wanted posters? They showed the members of the Red Army Faction who were authorized for denunciation and execution.
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which existed even before Corona, public opinion was mobilized against the most dangerous enemies of the FRG; let's say the bourgeois democracy, let's say the late capitalist society. (Here nothing about the really dangerous ones in striped suits and ties.)
Now the Stuttgarter Zeitung, which is usually more interested in Raudis in the S-Bahn or masturbators in the park, is publishing a new edition with the "war criminals" Putin's friends. Because they are so nice, there is a photo gallery. Of course, the StZ is poorly informed, because there are probably more "Russia-lovers" in this world than the StZ has room for photos.
But that is not the point. Instead, Ms Wagenknecht is in first place to fifth (!), followed by Ms Schwarzer.
Well, I don't know anyone in my environment who reads this paper anymore, if there is anyone, it's high time they did. We have reached the well-known level where nothing is left underneath.
And now, at least, Frau Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician of all the people who have not yet completely lost their minds, i.e. peace-loving, pacifist and anti-militarist people. (And here no further differentiation is necessary.)
Harald Glööckler files for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth
Designers Harald Glööckler (57) and his partner Dieter Schroth (74) have separated. Glööckler's lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser confirmed this to the "Bild" newspaper and RTL in the same words: "I can confirm that my client has filed an application for the dissolution of their civil partnership with the competent court via their family lawyer. I will not comment on the details."
Glööckler and his life partner Schroth had been together for 35 years, and rumors of a separation had been circulating for about a year. According to various media reports, after his participation in the jungle camp, the fashion designer moved from their shared house in the Palatinate to Berlin. He also spoke about marital problems on the RTL show.
SS massacre in Oradour-sur-Glane: Last survivor dead
In the destroyed village northwest of Limoges, whose ruins have been preserved, a memorial center was established in 1999. France's President Emmanuel Macron awarded Hébras the national order of merit a year ago. Hébras fought for freedom and defended the values of France, said Macron. He also contributed to the Franco-German peace. The survivor had campaigned, among other things, for Franco-German youth encounters.
A curve for 14 houses: In Homeien, everyone knows everyone
LZ series Nordlippische Weiler: In Homeien, it is not uncommon for three or four generations to live under one roof. Here, residents find pure idyllic surroundings. In the summer, up to 300 motorcycles per day race along the winding road between Niedermeien and Hillentrup - and some even go back the same way.
Christian Sewing, the head of Deutsche Bank, considers further interest rate increases in the fight against high inflation rates to be "absolutely" necessary. "The inflationary risks are still high. The cost of energy can easily rise again, and the opening of China can also give prices a temporary boost," Sewing told the "Welt am Sonntag".
At the beginning of February, the European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates in the eurozone for the fifth time in a row and announced another increase of 0.5 percentage points for the meeting on March 16. The key interest rate in the eurozone is now 3.0 percent. The deposit rate that commercial banks receive when they park money with the ECB is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates make loans more expensive, which can slow down demand and counteract high inflation rates. Higher interest rates can also lead to postponed investments and thus weaker economic growth.
Rising interest rates are also a burden for highly indebted eurozone countries such as Italy. "The consequences of sustained high inflation are far more serious than the higher financing costs for some countries," said Sewing. "Of course, we must keep this in mind, but a high level of debt must not prevent the ECB from acting consistently."
The ECB aims for medium-term price stability in the eurozone with an inflation rate of two percent. This target has been far from reached for months. In January, the price increase weakened again, but consumer prices in the currency area of the now 20 countries were still 8.5 percent above the level of the previous month.
Higher inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of consumers, as they can afford less for a euro. Strongly increased energy prices, which are a major driver of inflation, are also a burden for companies.
If inflation remains high, private consumption will "collapse sooner or later," warned Sewing, who is also president of the Federal Association of German Banks (BdB). "I currently see this as the greatest danger for the German economy. But I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario."
Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung hopes for a broad debate on the "Germany speed" called for by Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) in infrastructure projects. "There will have to be a political and societal dialogue about it. And it may also be a bit more controversial," he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart. He hopes that in the end, a set of rules will emerge, with which it will not necessarily have to go as fast as with the LNG terminals put into operation around the turn of the year - but not as slow as before either.
In mid-December, after ten months of planning and construction, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened. The aim was to close the gap in gas supply due to the lack of Russian gas deliveries to some extent. Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) had spoken of a new "German pace" on this occasion. In addition, the federal government had recently brought about an acceleration of approval procedures for wind turbines and power lines.
"First of all, it is very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it comes down to it. However, this should not automatically mean that we always act so categorically from now on and, for example, put a wind turbine in the neighbor's garden against their will," said Hartung. There must therefore always be a negotiation process about what is right and wrong as a society.
In the past, we have tried to use the classic rulebook and failed. "We should think again about whether our previous approach was the right one. Perhaps we have overdone it with the rulebook and made things too complicated".
In view of the many open tasks, for example, in the expansion of power lines, Hartung said that he does not envy the federal government and the companies involved, "As a consumer of this energy, I need the expansion to happen and it should be as green as possible".
Trade union warns of the break-up of the Bayer Group
The chemical workers' union IG BCE warns of a break-up of the company following an announced change in management at Bayer. "From the perspective of the employees, Bayer is perfectly positioned with its three pillars to meet the challenges of the future," said Francesco Grioli, a member of the union's board and a member of Bayer's supervisory board, to the "Rheinische Post" (Saturday edition).
This refers to the pharmaceutical business with prescription drugs, the Consumer Health business with over-the-counter medicines, and the agricultural business. "The transformation of the industry can only be achieved with a corporate policy based on risk diversification and sustainability - and not on hedge fund activism".
The background is the change in management at the pharmaceutical and agrochemical company announced on Thursday. The controversial CEO Werner Baumann will step down from his position this summer. The new CEO will be Bill Anderson, the former CEO of the Swiss rival Roche, who will take over at the beginning of June.
Baumann has been under criticism for a long time. The 2018 acquisition of the US seed producer Monsanto for $63 billion is hanging over the manager's head. With the purchase, the Leverkusen company had expensive legal disputes over alleged cancer risks of the herbicide glyphosate. Bayer's share price has been in freefall for years. In 2019, the shareholders even refused to grant the CEO discharge at the annual general meeting.
It has been known for some time that Baumann does not want to extend his contract, which was actually set to run until 2024. Long-term oriented strategic investors had put pressure on him. Recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors such as Bluebell Capital have also gotten involved. Bluebell is pushing for a split of the company, according to a media report.
The very small fund with an unknown level of participation in Bayer is known for its aggressive approach. A separation of "the Consumer Health division would be a possible way to increase the company's value," said Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, to the "Rheinische Post." However, he does not believe a separation of the much larger agricultural division, Crop Science, is feasible.
Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate against pension reform
Paris
On Saturday, the French also want to take to the streets again against the planned pension reform.
The unions are opposing a government plan with mass protests on the streets. Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate again against the pension reform on Saturday.
In France, hundreds of thousands of people are expected to demonstrate again on Saturday against President Emmanuel Macron's planned pension reform. For the fourth time, the unions are mobilizing against the government's plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. Already twice, over a million people took to the streets and there were nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 participants were counted at protests. A turbulent debate about the controversial reform has been taking place in parliament for a week.
Already now, many people in France work longer than until the age of 62, if they have not paid in long enough for a pension free of deductions when they reach retirement age. In many demanding professions, people could hardly work any longer, according to opponents of the reform. In addition, employees want to be able to enjoy their well-deserved pension and not completely wear out their health at work.
Macron: Threatening deficit in pension fund
Macron justifies the reform with a looming deficit in the pension fund. As the population is getting older, employees will have to contribute to an increasing number of pensioners. In order to keep the level of pensions stable, the population will have to work a little longer. Critics doubt the government's calculations and demand that the state find other sources of funding to keep the pension system in balance.
But the government wants to make changes not only to the retirement age. The increase in the necessary contribution period for a full pension, which was decided years ago, is to be accelerated. In addition, individual pension systems with privileges for certain professions are to be abolished. The minimum pension is to increase to around 1,200 euros.
The pension reform is considered one of President Macron's most important projects. During the Corona pandemic, an initial attempt to implement the reform was abandoned, and there were massive protests and strikes even then. Several presidents before Macron have tried to reform the French pension system with varying degrees of success - widespread protests and strikes were a certainty.
Since Macron's party no longer has an absolute majority in parliament, it is hoping to push through the reform with the help of the conservative Républicains, who have announced their support. However, some of the deputies - even from Macron's own party - still have reservations. And greater than the fear of a close vote at the moment is Macron's concern about paralyzing strikes. Before the renewed demonstrations on Saturday, the president said that he could count on the organizers to act responsibly so that they would proceed peacefully and not lead to a blockade of the country.
Quiet weather is expected - lots of sunshine in high altitudes.
A powerful high-pressure area is located over Central Europe and determines the weather in Germany. Does this mean that sunshine can be expected everywhere?
Offenbach
In Germany, calm high-pressure weather is expected at least until the middle of the week. "When looking at the weather maps, a powerful high-pressure area directly over Central Europe immediately catches the eye," explains meteorologist Markus Übel from the German Weather Service on Saturday in Offenbach. "Although this high moves a little to the east over the course of the next week, it still determines the weather in Germany."
However, calm high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Übel. "Such a high can even be quite mean and give people in the lowlands gloomy, foggy weather for days on end, while there is pure sunshine in the highlands of the midlands".
In most regions, Sunday starts off foggy and overcast. According to the DWD, it may also rain in the Erzgebirge and Thüringer Wald regions, as well as in Lower Bavaria. In particular, on the Alpine rim, but also in the southwest and parts of the west, the cloud cover will lift during the day and the sun will become more frequent. In the rest of the country, it will remain heavily overcast or covered in high-level fog. Temperatures will reach 4 to 9 degrees, near the Rhine around 10 degrees.
"On Monday, the gradually strengthening sun will gradually break through the high fog and be able to dissolve it more and more over the course of the day," says the meteorologist. Sunshine is expected all day on the edge of the Alps, in the uplands of the midlands and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, while elsewhere the sun has to fight its way through the high fog. The maximum temperatures are between 5 and 9 degrees, around 11 degrees are expected in the Lower Rhine region, while only around 3 degrees are expected in the southeast, in the permanent grey. A weak wind is blowing from different directions.
On Tuesday, in some low-lying areas, there may be only a slow clearing of fog or thick fog. Otherwise, the weather will be sunny after the fog clears. In high altitudes, in large parts of NRW and on the edge of the Alps, the sun is expected to shine all day, according to the forecast. Temperatures will rise to between 5 and 11 degrees depending on the amount of sunshine.
Dominatorin is disappointed: Goggia again without a World Championship medal
The favourite Sofia Goggia, who was knocked out in the downhill race of the Alpine Ski World Championships, was visibly disappointed.
Méribel
"I am sad because I did not perform to the level I am capable of," said the Italian on ZDF after she had set up a goal and was eliminated. Nevertheless, the 30-year-old was able to prevent a potentially serious fall.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill skier in the World Cup for years. She has won four of the six previous season races in this discipline. After winning gold in Pyeongchang in 2018, she won silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. Goggia, who is known for her risky driving style, still has to wait for a World Championship medal in her specialty. At her home race in Cortina d'Ampezzo two years ago, she was absent due to injury.
"I actually thought I was doing well. It was all about hundredths of a second," said Goggia after the surprising victory of Swiss skier Jasmine Flury in Méribel. "I am disappointed. I gave it my all. But that's life." Sometimes you believe things are guaranteed, she said about the medal that was expected by all experts and ultimately missed: "But they are not."
Girl missing in Berlin: Who has seen Viktoriya?
Viktoriya Stankovych has been missing since February 10.
Viktoriya Stankovych was last seen at the Waidmannslust S-Bahn station on Friday. The police are asking for information about her whereabouts.
Berlin. With the publication of a photo, the Berlin police are asking for the public's help in the search for a missing child. The 12-year-old Viktoriya Stankovych is said to have left the grounds of her school together with other children in the direction of the Waidmannslust S-Bahnhof on February 10, 2023, at around 12:30. She was last seen there at the S-Bahnhof. The child has been a refugee in Berlin since April 2022 and has only very limited knowledge of the German language and the local area.

Selenskyj and ministers against Russia's participation in the Olympics
Kiev. With their demand for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, sports politicians from 35 nations have increased the pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
It was agreed during a joint telephone conference to draw up a statement in order to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sporting competitions, the Lithuanian Ministry of Sport announced on its website.
"We demand the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues," said Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė.
The video consultation took place at the initiative of Great Britain. It was a very productive meeting, wrote the British Minister of Sport, Lucy Frazer, on Twitter. "And I made the position of Great Britain very clear: as long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus should not be represented at the Olympic Games. We will now issue a joint statement on this topic".
Previously, the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had protested against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions during an international video conference of sports ministers and other high-ranking representatives. "While Russia is killing and terrorizing, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions," said Zelenskyy. He published his speech on his Telegram channel. In the end, a neutral flag is also stained with blood and is not acceptable because of the Russian war of aggression.
Ukraine threatens with a boycott
Ukraine also considers Belarus to be a party to the war, because the country provides Russian troops with military bases for attacks. Selenskyj called on officials to work towards protecting the Olympic principles and prevent the admission of Russian athletes to the competitions. The President also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which he said has "unfortunately lost its honesty".
The reason for the conference was the announcement by the IOC that it wanted to allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international competitions under certain conditions. Ukraine has also threatened a boycott if the IOC allows the athletes to participate.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a position.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior, which is responsible for sports, subsequently stated that it had also confirmed during the discussions that it would reject the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes in Paris. "In our view, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian athletes back into competition. Ukrainian athletes must continue to receive the full solidarity and support of the international sports community. The IOC's efforts to reinstate Russian and Belarusian athletes are the wrong way to go," a spokesperson for the Ministry of the Interior said in response to a dpa inquiry.
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) had already emphasized at the end of January: "Sport should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against the Ukrainian civilian population. Major sporting events do not take place in a vacuum." Russia, on the other hand, emphasizes that sport and politics must be kept separate.
Currently, Russia and Belarus are excluded from many international sporting competitions. However, the IOC is aiming for a return of athletes from both countries to the international sporting stage under a neutral flag, provided they clearly declare their allegiance to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach recently stated that exclusion "because of a passport or place of birth" violates the ban on discrimination.
Pointing out where it happens.
"Hey, nice ass!" whistling at the foolish woman in the tight sexy costume and calling out lewd comments: all of this falls under the term "Catcalling". Behind the term lies nothing less than a form of verbal sexual harassment in public spaces.
Half of the vehicles lost? The USA sees Moscow's tank stocks greatly depleted
Half of the vehicles lost? The USA sees Moscow's tank stocks severely depleted
The Pentagon assumes that Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the beginning of the war. We are talking about "half of the main stock".
The Russian army has already lost half of its battle tanks in its war of aggression against Ukraine, according to estimates by the US Department of Defense. "Probably half of the main stock of tanks" of the Russian army has been "destroyed or confiscated" by Ukraine, said Celeste Wallander, Secretary of State for International Security Issues in the US Department of Defense.
Wallander did not provide any further details about the number of tanks seized and destroyed according to US estimates during an online event at the think tank Center for a New American Security.
In the coming weeks, Ukraine is set to receive battle tanks from several Western allies. Great Britain has promised to deliver Challenger-2 battle tanks to Kiev in March. Germany wants to deliver a battalion of Leopard-2 tanks to Ukraine in a coalition with other states by April. The USA has also promised a battalion of 31 battle tanks of the Abrams type, but their delivery is expected to take much longer.
Russia wants to catch up
In response to Western military aid, former Kremlin chief Dmitri Medvedev promised to build and modernize thousands of tanks. "As we know, our enemy abroad has been begging for planes, missiles, and tanks," said Medvedev, who is now the deputy head of the Russian Security Council, during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. "It is clear that in this case it is self-evident for us to increase the production of various types of weapons and military technology - including modern tanks."
Since last summer, a law has been in force in Russia that allows the economy to be more closely aligned with the needs of the army. As a result, individual industries can be required to supply the armed forces.
Turmoil over the filling of positions in the army
This is because the position that the former director of the Heeresgeschichtliches Museum (HGM) Christian Ortner will hold in the future was not advertised. The personnel representative of the Academy, Herwig Jedlaucnik, suspects post corruption and abuse of office. Defense Minister Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends the procedure.
A tender is not necessary because the appointment is for an unoccupied position, said the minister. "I do not want to comment on the speculations of a liberal personnel representative." Ortner was replaced last year after 17 years at the head of the HGM. In addition to criticism of the museum's handling of Austria's military past, he was faced with serious mobbing allegations, which Tanner believes have been cleared up.
Jedlaucnik also doubts the suitability of Ortners expertise. Ornter is an expert on the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current issues of security policy.
The SPÖ is demanding that Tanner provide clarification about the "unusual appointment process". The decision was tainted by the "appearance of job swapping", says SPÖ spokesperson Robert Laimer. The Neos are calling on Tanner to withdraw the appointment. The ÖVP is "still up to its neck in the corruption quagmire", said Douglas Hoyos, spokesperson for national defense. He announced a parliamentary inquiry on the subject.
Carnival: The first fools are forced to the ground by costs
Thuringia's carnival stronghold Wasungen wants to stick to the traditional carnival parade, unlike the state capital. However, the higher costs, including for security, are difficult to manage in Wasungen, says carnival president Marcel Kißling. The funds alone for this make up about half of the calculated total costs for the parade.
In Brandenburg, there are no carnival parades. The "Parade of the Happy People" in Cottbus, probably once again the largest in East Germany, is taking place for the first time after the pandemic. No parades have been cancelled for the Swabian-Alemannic carnival either.
Schleswig-Holstein's carnival stronghold Marne is sticking to its traditional parade despite the increased costs. "We are carrying out our event," says the president of the carnival society, Heiko Claußen. But even here, financial worries are a concern: if more sponsors are not found or the existing ones do not contribute more, reserves will have to be tapped - "this cannot be done every year". The current deficit: around 200,000 euros.
And inflation: for sweets, there has been a price increase of up to 60 percent in some cases, says Elvira Reuther from the Nürnberger Fastnachtszug support association. By chance, too much was ordered in 2020, which is why there is still enough stock this time. However, it is already certain that the parade will be more expensive. Twice as many people will be needed for security as in 2020.
Anyone standing on the side of the road during the carnival parade in the Rhineland might receive fewer sweets than before. Because sweets have become more expensive, some parade participants have less to give away. Sweets or not, the crowds are likely to be large: "I think that if it doesn't rain that day, we can expect an increased number of people," says Holger Kirsch, the carnival leader in Cologne. "This is due to the fact that there was no regular carnival parade for two years. The parade cannot be replaced by anything."
The organizing committee in Cologne does not comment in detail on the costs. However, the train is generally "deficitary", which is no secret.
The Ukraine diary: dreams and self-made vodka
The Ukrainians are not without reason known for their love of alcohol. There is domestic beer such as Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lviv. I always discover German beer here. Not Kulmbacher, but other large breweries such as Krombacher or Warsteiner. I can't really tell the difference in taste. The same applies to vodka, which is widely available. They mainly distill it in the villages themselves. They call it Samargon. No one knows exactly how much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics. In Russia, the Minister of Health claimed a few years ago that consumption had fallen by an incredible 80 percent in five years. Well, you can see that you can't really trust the Russians. It is said that tourists should be careful with it, but that only applies if they go to the mass market. Then it is probably also adulterated.
FC Hansa Rostock rewards itself for its hard work: "Luck on our side"
Eating and drinking
If you want to celebrate the weekend with a cocktail or have a beer after work, Rostock and Warnemünde have great places for that. The restaurant scene offers many locations for after-work meetings or pre-club parties. Where is the best place? A look at the Google reviews shows it.
Biathlon World Championships: Federal President sees a favourite win and praises Oberhof
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are greeted by the Schornsteinfeger-Meister Tobias Böttger and the Oberhofer mascot "Flocke" at the arena.
Oberhof. The German biathletes had nothing to do with the awarding of medals in the World Championship sprint in Oberhof. However, there were two glimmers of light in the fog.
No matter how hard the Federal President tried, it was impossible to tell from the VIP stand whether the discs actually fell at the shooting range on Saturday. "I had to get the results on my phone," Frank-Walter Steinmeier said with a smile, referring to the fog that kept rolling into the stadium, severely impairing the view of the race for the spectators.
Steinmeier nevertheless enjoyed the visit to the 10 km sprint race at the Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof, and received numerous tips from the Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "Since the Olympic Games in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race, I have been fascinated by biathlon," he revealed, and also praised Oberhof for its modernized sports facilities: "The newly renovated arena is great and offers ideal conditions. The athletes also say so - with thanks to those who have been working here since the World Championships were awarded". In terms of sustainability, the location is now "a step ahead" of many others and therefore "secure for the next few years and even decades".
Once again, the Norwegian Johannes Thingnes Bö outran the competition. Despite a penalty lap after a shooting error, he secured the win in 23:21.7 minutes, his sixth victory in the sixth sprint of the winter - and his second world title in Oberhof. His brother Tarjei, who shot without errors (14.8 seconds behind), and Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 penalty lap/39.9 seconds) as well as Johannes Dale (1/43.6) completed the Norwegian quadruple victory.
The local skiers were unable to get involved in the medal race the day after Denise Herrmann-Wick's triumph. Johannes Kühn, after a shooting error and with a deficit of 1:04.8 minutes, finished in eighth place as the best German. WM debutant Justus Strelow shot perfectly and became twelfth (1:14.6). Two glimmers of hope behind the grey veil. On the other hand, Benedikt Doll once again disappointed. After his disastrous mixed performance on Wednesday, the Black Forest native this time left five targets standing and disappeared as the 55th, deeply disappointed and without comment, into the dressing room.
Bö started the race in front of 14,300 spectators and manifested this status despite the complicated visibility conditions. However: in his last two standing shots, he had the luck of the skilled; they landed on the edge of the discs and still fell. The winner then enjoyed the award ceremony together with his five-year-old brother: "It's the best feeling to stand here with him," said the world champion: "We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes".
There is hardly any doubt that the Norwegians will also dominate the race on Sunday. In contrast, the German hopes rest with Herrmann-Wick. "If you start with the number one, the goal is not to finish tenth. There is only full throttle and attack to defend the number one," said Sport Director Felix Bitterling, putting his "locomotive" to the test. The organizers expect an almost sold-out arena for the double event (13.25 and 15.30 hours/ZDF and Eurosport live).
Brych is not pleased with the "bee swarm" on the pitch
Felix Brych - Referee Felix Brych decides at the referee's ball.
Aggressive players or grumpy coaches? Germany's referees want to "consistently punish unsporting behavior". Referee chief Fröhlich points to a role model function.
The German top referee Felix Brych has identified negative trends in the way players interact on the pitch. "I think there are new behaviours from the players, who surround the referee after decisions a bit like a swarm of bees and try to push him into the review area," the 47-year-old told the German Press Agency. "We discussed this during the winter break. We have decided that we do not want to accept such unsporting behaviour. We will pay more attention to this in the future and will also sanction it."
Lastly, two coaches were also given place bans. Mainz coach Bo Svensson was sent off during the cup defeat against FC Bayern. For Freiburg coach Christian Streich, the league defeat in Dortmund resulted in a red card. "The coach's behavior also falls into the category of unsporting behavior. We have noticed that unsporting behavior has increased in this area, that the behavior towards referees has become a bit more demanding or aggressive. We also want to punish such unsporting behavior consistently," said Brych.
DFB referee chief Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed out a fundamentally good relationship between coaches and referees. "Overall, the relationship fits. There are reactions, followed by consistent counter-reactions. The affected person must then live with that. That shouldn't be anything world-shattering," Fröhlich told the German Press Agency.
"Emotions can certainly lead to conflicts during the course of a game. But if emotions spill over into personal insults, then you have to accept that the appropriate measures will be taken by the referee," said Fröhlich. In recent cases, the parties involved have cleared things up afterwards. "It would only be important if such behavior were to be generally discouraged," said Fröhlich on the sidelines of an event of the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed out possible effects on a different level. "Of course, incidents from professional football always have an impact. There is a role model effect, resulting in imitation. In the most recent cases in the Bundesliga, the referees have consistently reacted to negative behavior," said Fröhlich. "Regardless of the consistent interpretation of the rules in the game, a clarifying conversation, with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those affected, is always helpful."
Combined athlete Oftebro wins in Schonach
The victory was secured by the Norwegian Jens Luraas Oftebro after a jump from the normal hill and the 10-kilometre cross-country ski race, ahead of the Austrian leader Johannes Lamparter. Third place went to Kristjan Ilves from Estonia.
The German combined team is not at full strength in the Black Forest. Beijing Olympic champions Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel and Johannes Rydzek are not there. They are preparing for the World Championships with training in Oberstdorf, which will take place from 21 February to 5 March in the Slovenian Planica. "We have three world-class athletes at home. The team naturally feels this," said team coach Hermann Weinbuch on ZDF.
Seven people with minor injuries after a collision on the A5
Seven people, including two children, were slightly injured in a collision involving four vehicles on the A5 motorway near Hemsbach (Rhein-Neckar-Kreis). According to a police statement, the collision occurred on Saturday when a driver, caught in a slight traffic jam from behind, collided with a car and pushed it into two other vehicles. The full closure of the lanes in the direction of Heidelberg was lifted after about an hour and a half.
Finissage at the Marl Sculpture Museum
The exhibition was initiated by the initiators Sebastian Freytag (left) and Georg Elben (right), who are standing in front of the artist Christian Freudenberger's mural.
On Sunday, 12 February, an unusual exhibition will come to an end at the Marl Sculpture Museum. There will be some extras for the finale.
The closing event for the exhibition "Wandgebunden" will take place on Sunday, 12 February, at 3 pm in the transitional quarters of the Marl Sculpture Museum in Georg-Herwegh-Straße 63-67. In three exhibition rooms, two large-format wall paintings will attract attention.
After the exhibition, the walls will be painted over and the artworks will disappear. However, a catalogue will document the works created specifically for the Marl Museum. It will be presented by the two curators, Georg Elben and Sebastian Freytag, on 12 February.
For the final event, Dr. Friederike Schuler will also give a talk on wall-bound art in the service of the community. Using numerous examples, she will present the special features of wall painting from the Weimar Republic and ask about the connections to this art form in the Federal Republic, with a focus on NRW from the 1950s to the 1970s.
Dr. Friederike Schuler is a freelance art historian and curator who earned her doctorate in 2013 on the wall paintings of the Weimar Republic. Since then, she has been researching building-related art as well as the history of art and institutions in post-war Germany, most recently in collaboration with Sebastian Freytag on art in construction in NRW. After the lecture, the final curator-led tour of the exhibition will take place. The artists will be present on site.
Arrest warrants after building collapses in Turkey
It is about construction defects that have contributed to the collapse of buildings: in the Turkish earthquake region, the judicial authorities have issued arrest warrants against dozens of suspects.
Istanbul. In the south of Turkey, dozens of arrest warrants have been issued following building collapses during the earthquake. In the city of Diyarbakir, arrest warrants have been issued against 33 people, reported the state news agency Anadolu on Saturday, citing prosecutors. The accused are said to be responsible for construction defects that contributed to the collapse of the buildings.
The public prosecutor's office in Adana is also investigating possible construction defects in collapsed buildings, according to Anadolu. As part of these investigations, 62 arrest warrants have been issued so far, it was reported. One of the accused was reportedly arrested at the airport in Istanbul. He allegedly tried to travel to Montenegro with cash and is now in custody, Anadolu reported. Nine other people were arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.
On Monday morning, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.7 shook the Turkish-Syrian border area, followed by another earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 in the afternoon. More than 7,500 buildings collapsed in Turkey alone.
Former East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow has died.
Hans Modrow is dead, the Left Party in the German parliament announced. The 95-year-old died in the night before Saturday. The party's chairman Dietmar Bartsch praised the former SED official and later PDS and Left politician as a "deeply sincere socialist".
"Hans Modrow passed away last night at the age of 95," the Left Party in the Bundestag announced on Saturday. The party is losing "a significant personality," explained the party's chairman Dietmar Bartsch and the former party leader Gregor Gysi.
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the 1st secretary of the SED district leadership in Dresden. As Minister President, he accompanied the end of the GDR. Only four days after the fall of the wall, on November 13, 1989, he became the chairman of the GDR Council of Ministers - for around 150 days. In the Volkskammer elections on March 18, 1990, the SED/PDS lost power and Modrow lost his office a month later. He was succeeded as the last Minister President of the GDR until reunification by the CDU politician Lothar de Maizière.
The chairman of the Left Party, Dietmar Bartsch, described Modrow in a message on the microblogging service Twitter as a "deeply sincere and combative socialist". Bartsch added:
"Right up until his old age, he was an important advisor in our party, and his wisdom will be sorely missed."
"The peaceful course of the reunification of Germany was precisely a special achievement of his. This will remain his political legacy," Bartsch and Gysi wrote in their obituary.
"His later work in the Volkskammer, the Bundestag, the European Parliament and as honorary chairman of the PDS always consisted in representing even those parts of the former population of the GDR who were not wanted and whose interests were regularly violated."
After reunification, Modrow sat in the German Bundestag for the PDS from 1990 to 1994 and represented it in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
As reported by the German Press Agency (dpa), Modrow viewed the new state "with some criticism". German unity was achieved too quickly, the GDR was swallowed up too unconditionally, and it was condemned as an "unlawful state" too unilaterally, Modrow criticized in many interviews, according to dpa.
What happened in the night.
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has condemned Russian rocket attacks. Meanwhile, Kiev must carry out repairs to the power grid.
Kiev - The latest wave of Russian rocket attacks is forcing new repairs to the Ukrainian energy grid. However, Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions. Several thermal and hydroelectric power plants have been damaged, said the head of the energy supplier Ukrenerho, Volodymyr Kudryzkyj, on Friday evening on Ukrainian television. The situation with the power supply in the Charkiw region is particularly bad. Due to the instability in the Ukrainian power grid, a reactor block had to be shut down at the Chmelnyzkyj nuclear power plant, and production was curtailed at the Riwne and Southern Ukraine nuclear power plants.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the Russian attack with about 100 rockets and cruise missiles on Friday as terrorism. In a video message, however, he reported to his countrymen how much support Ukraine received on his trip to London, Paris and Brussels this week.
Selenskyj does not want to abandon the small town of Bachmut
On February 24, war will be declared for a year. US President Joe Biden announced a visit to Poland, a key supporter of Ukraine, shortly before the anniversary. The danger of Russian missile attacks continued into the night before Saturday. In the capital Kiev, an air raid alarm was sounded for the fifth time that day late on Friday evening. "An attack with drones is imminent," the military administration of the Kiev region reported. Combat drones of Iranian design were also spotted and shot down over the areas of Mykolajiw and Odessa in the south.
Deutsche Bahn: The government selects consultants for the network company
Demands from the FDP and the Greens, among others, to split it off, failed due to the coalition partner SPD. In the coalition agreement, a compromise was reached on an infrastructure company that should, however, be geared towards the common good in the future. This means that it does not need to generate and distribute profits.
Backlog of 80 billion euros in renovations
The two consulting firms are to help the government to monitor this process. The backlog of repairs to the rail network is a major reason why the railways are currently running very late. Transport Minister Wissing has made it his mission to eliminate this problem with the complete renovation of entire railway corridors. The investments required for this have been estimated at 50 billion euros, but according to more recent calculations by the railways, they are likely to be as much as 80 billion euros.
Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof 2023 - Gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: "Can someone pinch me, please?"
In this case, the external circumstances apparently did not work in Herrmann-Wick's favor. She said after the race that she had slept poorly, was "totally agitated", and her pulse had not returned to normal even when she entered the arena. "A race like this", and at the home World Championships, "can't be described with words", she said. 11,000 spectators cheered to the thumping schlager music with German flags, and coaches and team members fell into each other's arms.
"Enjoy the biathlon", that was her goal
The pressure had been particularly high for Herrmann-Wick. The 34-year-old had started the World Championships as the biggest, if not the only, German medal hope outside of the relay teams. Herrmann-Wick is the only German to have won two World Cups this winter. She currently occupies fifth place in the overall World Cup. And even though the performance density among women is significantly higher at the top than among men, where Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians currently dominate, one would have expected different names to be on the list for this sprint victory.
Criticism of the government - Bishop in Nicaragua sentenced to 26 years in prison
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-leaning head of state. He accuses Ortega of suppressing religious freedom. Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been severely strained since 2018, when demonstrators demanding Ortega's resignation took refuge in churches. More than 350 people died in the protests in 2018. Thousands of people left the Central American country in the following years, often out of fear of repression or arrest. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of conspiring with the US government to overthrow him.
Bundeswehr: The arms industry is demanding more orders from the special fund
The first arms projects have therefore already been cancelled, and further projects are threatened with the same fate, as reported by the "Welt am Sonntag". It is currently not possible to say which investments will be cancelled in concrete terms. "There is no need to assign specific procurement measures to a possible need for savings at this point in time," says a response from the federal government to a question from the member of parliament Ingo Gädechens (CDU).
The background to the declining investment sum is the rising interest rates. The special fund, which is fully financed by credit and which the Bundestag had decided on in June 2022, must bear the interest burden for the loans itself. If these rise, there is therefore less money available for the specific acquisitions for the Bundeswehr. In addition, the current high inflation reduces the purchasing power of the remaining sum.
Kupferzell: Accident with 3 injured
In the night from Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.), at around 1:40 a.m., a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from Kupferzell, wanted to turn left onto the motorway in the direction of Heilbronn at the Kupferzell motorway entrance. At this time, a 21-year-old VW driver was driving on the B 19 in the direction of Künzelsau, as the police reported. During the BMW driver's turning maneuver, there was a collision between the two vehicles.
Both parties involved in the accident stated that the traffic lights installed at the accident site showed "green" for them. An inspection of the traffic lights revealed no issues. Further investigations are ongoing. The 24-year-old, the 21-year-old, and the passenger in the BMW were each slightly injured in the accident and had to be taken to the hospital. The two cars suffered a total of approximately 20,000 euros in damage.
Schlossplatz Stuttgart remembers the victims of the earthquake disaster
Many people from Stuttgart followed the call of the Ditib mosque community in Feuerbach on Friday evening.
Tens of thousands of people have died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria. There is great sympathy - also in Stuttgart.
The earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria is preoccupying the world. On Friday evening, more than 200 people gathered on the Schlossplatz in Stuttgart to remember the victims and pray for them.
Many members of the congregation followed the call of the Ditib mosque community in Feuerbach, young and old, women and men. They all listened to the imam's prayer in silence and with seriousness. In the prayer, the imam asked Allah for help for the people in the affected areas, so that they could also overcome this disaster. He asked, among other things, for health, protection from plagues, and for respectful treatment of one another. The congregation also requested assistance and strength "to bring our help to the areas affected by the earthquake".
Ditib stands by the people in Turkey and Syria. The speakers expressed their sympathy for the victims and their families, who numbered more than 22,000 at the time of the memorial event. The prayers were also translated into German on the castle square.
Muslims in Germany have shown great solidarity with the victims of the earthquake in the Turkish-Syrian border region. The donation campaign of the German Islamic Association Turkish-Islamic Union (Ditib) has already raised several million euros.
The Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt has collected donations of goods in Glockenstraße over several days, which are to be transported by lorry to the earthquake areas. Even there, the willingness to help was overwhelming.
Hiking with meat filling - Ebersberg
"After eating, you should rest or take a thousand steps"... The older generation knows the proverb, the younger generation simply puts it into practice. In any case, during the pandemic years, the good old digestive walk has experienced an unprecedented renaissance. Because who, thanks to home office, is not sitting in the middle of a desert of stone, but rather just a stone's throw away from fields, woods, and meadows, now uses the lunch break either after the quick snack in front of the screen or instead for a walk in the fresh air. At least that is the impression around the Egglburger See, where between 12 and 14 o'clock not only dog owners are hanging out.
One reason could of course be that people in modern times can associate the health-promoting supply of fresh air with other things as a result of optimal use of time slots. Why not, for example, learn about news from the settlement from the long-lost neighbor during a short walk through nature? Or meet a friend with whom one never manages to go to the cinema, not even to the Alte Kino? In this way, work and private life can also be combined - who says that the appointment with the tax consultant, lawyer or investment advisor cannot take place outdoors, provided that there are no foreign ears nearby, of course.
What you can also do very well is buy things like fresh fruit, which is on a table by the side of the road along with a small cheese selection. Or potatoes and meat. It's only a shame if you haven't already thought about the purchase and made the necessary arrangements. An elderly couple in Hinteregglburg leave the farmer's wooden sales room empty-handed and with regret in their voices: "It's a shame, we forgot to bring money."
One can sympathize with the disappointment, even if one does have a companion with a wallet, but not a means of transport. The sympathetic stranger is informed of this. To which the man replies: "That's not true! You do have a bag with you!" He points to the hood of the jacket, which one quickly put on before leaving the house, even though the sunshine makes an additional head covering unnecessary. "My wife always packs everything in there!"
And so it happens that you set out on the return journey with a meat dish and, on this midday excursion, you have not only gained a lamb fillet, but also a very practical idea. It is quite possible that a second walk will be in order that day - after dinner, this time actually for digestion.
Trapped and severely injured
Around 9 p.m., the 25-year-old was driving his Audi on the Kreisstraße towards Hailfingen when, for reasons that are still unclear, he veered off the road to the right in a left-hand bend, according to the police report. The Audi hit a guide post, collided with a tree on the side and came to a stop a few meters away. The driver was trapped in his car as a result of the collision. The fire department freed him with heavy equipment. The ambulance service took the seriously injured man to a hospital. Since there was a suspicion of driving while incapacitated, a blood sample was taken. According to the police report, the Audi was a total loss, with damage estimated at 1000 euros.
Donald Trump's tax records: a point for the rule of law
The US Department of Justice has decided: The financial authority must hand over the tax returns of the former president to parliament.
Trump 2018, still in office as President of the USA
The Finance Ministry must order the tax authority IRS to release confidential documents to the Finance and Tax Committee, the ministry's decision on Friday stated.
Contrary to political customs in the USA, the real estate entrepreneur Trump had not made his tax returns public either as a candidate or later as president. He fought against their release all the way to the Supreme Court. A prosecutor's office in New York has now received the documents, but no details may be made public from them - unless a trial takes place.
The release to Congress is probably more sensitive for Trump: There, the circle of those authorized to access the information is somewhat larger and, under certain conditions, individual details could be released during the course of the committee's investigation. In addition, confidential information is always leaking out of Congress.
The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, immediately welcomed the decision as a "victory for the rule of law". Access to the Republican's tax records is a matter of national security, she wrote on Twitter. "The American people deserve to know the facts about his conflicts of interest and his undermining of our security as president," Pelosi explained.
Cabaret in the Bastion: Life plays between birth and death
Kirchheim. Pasta or pizza? Samsung or Apple? Which mobile phone contract among the many offers? Stay or quit? Either - or? As slaves to time, people today rush from one appointment to the next, sometimes pushing people and hamburgers in between. Lucy van Kuhl shows in her new program that the "in-between" state has something exciting about it.
In a humorous and thought-provoking way, Lucy van Kuhl tells and sings about situations from life. In her sensitive chansons and snappy cabaret songs, she gets to the heart of the matter - and there is a lot between the lines. The show starts on Saturday, February 18th at 8.30 pm in the Kirchheimer Club Bastion.
British serious offender caught after a long flight in Thailand
London - After five years on the run, a convicted drug dealer from Great Britain has been caught in Thailand. As the British National Crime Agency announced on Saturday, the man was arrested by Thai police on Friday in a car workshop in Bangkok. The 55-year-old was on the "Most Wanted" list of the criminals most wanted by the NCA.
According to government sources, the leader of a criminal group fled in early 2018 before the start of a trial in which he was sentenced to eleven years in prison in absentia for attempting to import amphetamines worth eight million pounds (nine million euros).
Encounters at the church table

Cabaret - Stories from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: The physicist from Lower Franconia, who has been living in Vienna for three years and, according to his own statements, loves the Viennese sense of humor, uses his cabaret programs to champion science. This is reflected in the programmatic title of his current solo show, "Make Science Great Again". Whether this fits in well with the generally prevailing skepticism towards science in Austria is a matter of debate. However, his humor fits in very well with Vienna.
The English title also derives from Eberts' recent life story, as in 2019 he tried to make a name for himself as a stand-up comedian in New York. But now he is back and he tells his German audience not only about his experiences abroad, but also explains what Wissenaft actually is and what it can and cannot do. Of course, Corona is also mentioned, as well as German thoroughness in the bathroom and American engineering skills.
And he breaks it down to the most important question that many people avoid: What is really important? All of this with a huge wink, unpretentious and very ironic. And so, not only are they entertained, but they can also learn something from it.
Please go for typing... it doesn't take long, it doesn't hurt and it can save many people's lives.

1. Generalities
The one-man entertainment device BATTLEZONE is equipped with a Vector or X/Y monitor. This game illustrates the battle from the perspective of a tank driver. The battles take place in a wide valley completely surrounded by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley there are rock pyramids and boulders that offer the player temporary protection, as they cannot be destroyed by enemy fire.
The opponent is represented by slow-moving tracked vehicles and fast super tanks, as well as agile rockets that are increasingly difficult to hit during the extended gameplay. In addition, UFOs appear at periodic intervals. These cannot attack the player's tank, but the player can achieve a high score by being hit by a UFO. The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) different modes of operation. These are the attraction mode, the game introduction mode, the game mode, the initialization input for maximum results, and the self-test mode. The latter mode represents a special sequence for checking the controls and computer functions.
4. Gameplay
The game is triggered when the push-button switch START is activated. The LED switch remains lit and the game sounds can be heard. If the last player tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, the game is over. The game begins with tanks moving slowly, which become visible on the screen. The player can determine the position of the respective enemy tanks or rockets by paying attention to the displayed text in the upper left corner of the cockpit. An example of a message could be: ENEMY FROM THE RIGHT. In addition, a point is visible on the wide-range radar screen, accompanied by a sonar BLIP sound, which represents the enemy position.
The upper, conical area on the radar screen represents the player's field of vision on the screen below. If the opponent is in this area, he can be easily targeted on the screen. Furthermore, the message "OPPONENT IN FIRE AREA" is displayed in the upper left-hand information display at the same time.
For a short time, UFOs appear on the screen, flying over the battlefield. These are harmless missiles that observe the battle and cannot eliminate either the enemy or the player's tank. The flight position of the UFOs cannot be detected by radar. The UFOs are intended to round out the battle and distract the player, as they usually appear at the same time as enemy tanks or missiles. UFOs can be eliminated by both the player's tank and the enemy's tank. A hit by the player earns 5,000 points. If the player hits an enemy, the following points are achieved: 1,000 points for a slow-moving tank, 2,000 points for a missile, and 3,000 points for a supertank. A supertank moves and turns twice as fast as the player's tank or a slow-moving enemy tank. Multiple options give the game designer the opportunity to use 2, 3, 4 or even 5 tanks in the game. Furthermore, after reaching predetermined point values, a bonus tank can be unlocked and the appearance of the missile can be varied for a more difficult game setup. Details and the exact switch positions for the game setup option are shown in the illustration.
5. Initial input at maximum results
If a player exceeds the minimum score in the High Score Table, he or she can enter three (3) personal initials into the table after the game ends. The instructions for this are self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. It should be noted that when a self-test is triggered, the RESET button is pressed on the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PCB or when the mains voltage is interrupted, the High Score Table is deleted. When deleted (RESET), the ten (10) highest point scores with their initials are obtained and written back onto the screen to challenge further players. Any point score over 100,000 is additionally marked with a tank symbol followed by the player's initials. If a player does not enter their initials within 60 seconds, the computer will automatically write dashes in. After this, the device will switch back to the attraction gameplay. CONFIGURATION
1. New parts
The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) new components. If you already have experience with ATARI video devices, you should take note of these important differences. The new parts are: A. The control lever. This is a redesign of the ATARI control lever. It has been reinforced by several additional ribs in the inner and outer housing parts, which made this assembly unit more stable and ensured proper functioning of the switch contacts. Another modification is the rubber centering bumper, which, like a centering spring, always brings the control lever back into the center position. The micro switches are now attached with self-locking nuts for easier replacement. B. Two PC boards. ATARI'S X/Y game circuit was expanded to two interconnected boards. These are the analog vector generator and auxiliary board. With the help of this switching technique, more lines are generated on the screen at a higher speed, resulting in a uniform and smooth image. C. The power supply. Battlezone is equipped with a newly designed power supply. It has a larger, more powerful transformer to cover the increased energy supply provided by the expansion of the circuit. D. The device housing. Due to the new design, it was now possible to install a new cash box with a larger coin acceptance capacity. Furthermore, the device contains a console that is intended as a podium for smaller players to make playing easier. At the same time, this console ensures maximum device stability at the installation location.
These new components, as well as all other main assemblies of this device, are shown in Figure 1. If any of these new parts are mentioned in the manual, you will find this symbol. 2. Device inspection
After removing the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready to play. However, you should still perform a certain amount of checks to complete the quality control. The following checks should be performed to ensure that the device has been delivered to you in good condition: NOTE: Do not connect the device to the 220 V network yet. A. Examine the outside of the housing for any damage. B. Open the maintenance flap of the device and check the components inside the device as follows: (1) Check all cable connectors for a correct and secure connection. If any connectors are open or loose, connect them together.
NOTE: Never force the plug connections. The plugs are provided with a positive guide, so that a correct connection is established. A plug connection rotated by 180 degrees will destroy the PCB.
(2) Check the plug connections to the game PC board for a correct and secure fit. (3) Check the production number of the device on the type plate on the back of the device. Check that the embossed production number matches that of the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PC board, auxiliary PC board, regulator/audio II PC board and the TV monitor. An image of the location of the production number can be found on the back cover of this manual. This number should always be provided when you call your service provider for further service information. (4) Check all other main components such as the power supply, control console and TV monitor for proper installation. (5) Finally, the device must be supplied with mains voltage and switched on. Check that the radar screen is also located in the bright, orange-circled opening in the cover. If the opening is not centered precisely, the cover, which is attached to the housing with adhesive tape, must be removed and repositioned. Before connecting the device to the mains supply, ensure that the voltage selector plug on the power supply unit 1 (see Fig. 3) matches the local mains voltage. Check the color of the cable on the plug and check the connection values as listed below:
ARE YOU HAVING PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SOFTWARE? Here are a number of tips that can help you solve most problems related to current DirectX games. Check your system configuration
Please take the time to check that your system meets the requirements listed on the packaging. The DirectX diagnostic program can give you an overview of your system if you are unsure if your PC meets the requirements. To call up the DirectX diagnostic program, follow these steps: click on the "Start" button and select the "Run" option. Enter "dxdiag" in the text field. The user interface of the DirectX diagnostic program will now be displayed. Here you have access to all relevant system details, including information about the graphics and sound card. You can check, among other things, whether graphics and sound are working correctly by clicking on the corresponding buttons to test DirectDraw, Direct3D, and DirectSound. Note: If you do not have advanced computer knowledge, we would advise against changing any of the options in the DirectX diagnostic program. Before starting the game
It can happen that other programs take up the system resources that the game needs to run smoothly. Not all of these programs are obviously active, and many are automatically started when the system is booted up. Such programs, which are constantly active on your system, are also called “background applications”. In some cases, they can be the cause of your program hanging or crashing. Therefore, we recommend that you end such background applications before starting the game. - If antivirus or crash guard programs are running on your system, you should close or deactivate them before starting the game. To do this, search for the program's icon in the Windows taskbar, right-click the icon and select the appropriate option ("Deactivate", "Close", or similar). - Once you have deactivated the antivirus and crash guard programs, you should also end all general background applications, as these sometimes cause problems when you install or run a PC game. You can read more about this in the section “How to end all unnecessary background applications”. Cleaning up the system
Before installing software, it must be ensured that your hard drive is functioning optimally. Therefore, you should make it a habit to regularly “clean up” your PC. The tools you need for this are included with Windows: use ScanDisk, Defragmentation, and Disk Cleanup to ensure everything runs smoothly. Then the chances are high that current games will run largely without problems on your PC. A “clean” system also has the advantage that it works much more efficiently, and thus other applications you use will also run faster and more stably. Consult the Windows Help files to learn about the ScanDisk and Check Disk, Defragmentation, and Disk Cleanup tools. Using the Windows Help
1. Click on the “Start” button and select the “Help” (or “Help and Support”) option to access the Windows help. 2. Now click on the search field and enter the corresponding keyword, e.g. “ScanDisk” (Win 98/ME), “Error Checking” (Win 2000/XP), “Defragmentation” and “Disk Cleanup”. You will then receive instructions that explain how to use these tools.
The game crashes or hangs?
When playing games that use the latest version of DirectX, you should make sure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card. This can often prevent a game from crashing or hanging. First, you should try downloading the latest drivers from the website of the graphics card manufacturer. Here are the current graphics card manufacturers:

If you want to call, you should sit at your PC and have the following information ready (see section “Checking the system configuration”). Please also prepare note-taking materials. - PC brand and model - Processor type - Operating system including version number (e.g. Windows® 98;Windows® Me) - RAM (working memory) - Information about graphics and sound card and drivers
INTRODUCTION TO DRIVING ABILITY
The desire to develop video games was sparked in me by the advent of 3D real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a multitude of new possibilities and appeared to me as a new means of expression, with which one could push the world to its limits. It represented an opportunity to explore new horizons. I felt like a cinematic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century: on the one hand, I struggled with the still immature technology, but on the other hand, I was aware that there was still everything to be discovered - in particular, a new language that was both narrative and visual. To be honest, the next ten years did not satisfy my hunger. I had the dull feeling that video games only utilized a tiny part of their amazing creative possibilities, because they were too focused on "action" and forgot about a fundamental element of the human experience: emotions. In the meantime, technology continued to make rapid progress. Fahrenheit represents my contribution to making video games a true, emotion-conveying means of expression. Although this could of course have happened in a completely different form, Fahrenheit's greatest merit is the fact that it raises real questions and offers concrete answers. Fahrenheit is proof that it is possible to create an interactive gaming experience that is not only based on fighting against abhorrent monsters in dark corridors and collecting ammunition, but also has much more demanding and in-depth content. It is proof that one can tell a story and offer game content without having to sacrifice the narrative or interactive elements. I hope that both hardcore gamers and casual players will enjoy this new gaming experience. If you are skeptical about video games, I hope that Fahrenheit will help change your attitude towards them. May other developers also feel the desire to take this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspiration, talent, and ambition. Interactivity is still in its infancy and offers the chance to discover everything anew. Over the past two years, Fahrenheit has filled a large part of our lives and has been an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, in which we were constantly forced to question many of the previously unshakable principles. I would be happy if Fahrenheit, like books, films, and songs that have left a lasting impression on you, also leaves its mark on you. David Cage

Gameplay
The game is started for one or (with a minimum credit of 2) for two players by pressing the corresponding start button. The aim is to get as much area as possible without crossing the rotating QIX or hitting the wandering SPARX. The game is set up so that a minimum area must be occupied before the next area (round) can be tackled. The timing SPARX are displayed at the top of the screen by red timing lines. When the red lines meet, additional SPARX are released. When an alarm is triggered, the SPARX become SUPER-SPARX and more aggressive. If, while trying to draw your territory, your marking symbol gets caught in the death spiral, it will be destroyed, as you cannot cross or go back your own way. If you hesitate and do not complete your area, a fuse is lit and your marking symbol is destroyed. Two speed settings are available. At a slower drawing speed, the points are doubled. After opening the control panel, the 4 programming and test switches are accessible.
The QIX game is capable of self-testing, providing data and demonstrating that circuits and controls are working correctly. For more information, see "Service Program". The volume can be adjusted on the volume control (VOLUME) on the Data/Sound PC board.

SERVICE PROGRAM
In general, the 4 switches located in the device, the self-test button, and the LEDs on the video PC board are used for programming and testing.
Programming display. This display is used to select the language (English, French, Spanish, German) with which the address programming and the game work. The "Sub-Test" switch can be used to set the languages. If the desired language appears in green, press the "Test" switch to switch to the next program display. Use display: This display can be used to determine the difficulty factor for the game. It can also be used to set a "maximum number of credits" that may be used before the game begins. The text to be changed is set by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch (appears in green), the desired value is programmed using the "Up" or "Down" switch. By pressing the "Sub-Test" switch multiple times, the factory or basic setting can be reached, if the bottom line (RESET line) lights up in green, press the "Up" switch. The values are reset, the pointer (so called green lines) jumps to the first line, further programming can take place. "Test" always triggers the next program display. "Back" [Reserve High Score Value x 10 000) is used to transfer the high score points to the next program display until "High Score Rate so far". This value determines the required number of points/hits that a player needs for his initials (name) and the hit points to be entered on the screen. The "Maximum number of credits" determines a coin acceptance limit for the device. If the limit is exceeded, the coin acceptance is blocked if a coin lock is present. This can limit the number of games a player can play. This value is from 1 - 99. It should not be set so close to 99 that by inserting a coin the credits cannot be reduced to zero when added to 99. A free play mode can be selected by setting "Maximum credits" to O. Further programming: "Number of games": Number of marking symbols per credit.
"Threshold": the % value that must be reached in order to switch to the next round.
"Time limit": release for additional Sparx
"Difficulty": Difficulty level of the gameplay
"Anziehton": no sound at "0" in standby mode
"1" tone also in stationary mode (animated tone) "table model": "0" stationary device
"1" table device
The credits per coin are set on the "insert slot programming" display. High score program display (highest score achieved so far"). The points and initials of the player, including the next 10 point numbers, appear. The values are used to set the high score, which was selected on the previous display (set to "back"). By pressing the "up" button, the initials QIX Standard are set. By pressing the "test" button, the next program display appears. The "total summary". By pressing the "up" button, it can be set to 0. The following values are recorded: Total credit: The number of paid credits. The total number is not set to 0. If 1,000,000 is reached, the count starts over. The total number can only appear at 0 if the battery or the W1 connector is removed, with the device turned off. Left-handed coins: The number of coins inserted in the left coin slot. Middle coins: (not available) Right-handed coins: The number of coins inserted in the right coin slot. Credits paid: The number of credits given for coins thrown in (coins turned over). Credits granted: The number of credits given by the device. % Free spins: Credits granted (paid + granted credits per 100) Played minutes: The number of minutes played. Minutes won: The number of minutes extended or won. % Free time: Minutes won/minutes played per 100. Average game duration in seconds: Minutes played/credits paid + granted.
High Score (hit rate): the number of times a player has had a high enough hit rate to displace other players from the high score list. The values are reset to 0 by pressing the "Up" button. Pressing the "Test" button displays the next program display.
Coin slot programming/normal coin setting. With the help of this display, the installer can select a standard coin setting or program another setting.
If a default setting is provided, the programming is selected by pressing the "Up" and "Down" buttons, while the top digit lights up green on the screen. The size values change with the change in the digit. When the correct setting is reached by pressing the "Test" button, the setting is adopted. If a setting is desired that does not correspond to the default setting, the values can be set by pressing the "Sub-Test" button. After a single press, the top setting number is set to 0, which means that a custom setting is possible. Since the lower values are unchanged, the programmer can reduce his setting efforts by selecting a setting that is close to his desired values and only changes the values that are not appropriate. As soon as the setting is made, any new setting value can be selected by pressing the "Sub-Test" button. In the event of an unwanted press, the default setting appears. The "Up" and "Down" buttons can be used to increase or decrease the values. The process is ended by pressing the "Test" button. The coin multiplier ("coin unit") indicates how many coin units are given for each coin inserted through an assigned slot. "Coin units" - "credit" shows the number of units required before a credit is issued. "Bonus" coin units show the units required before a bonus credit is issued. "Min.-Münze" is a value that accumulates credits until a specified minimum amount of coins is reached. In the default setting, this value is not used ("0"). CMOS MEMORY FAILURE
If "Memory Failure - Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, in which all programming is stored, has failed. All values stored in the RAM are reset to the factory default settings. This condition probably indicates a failure or malfunction of the battery.
ERROR CHECKING and SETTINGS
Start the testing method. Press the "Sub-Test" switch or the "Self-Test" button (SW 1 near the LED display). All LEDs should light up and the hardware test can begin. The tests and settings can be entered for the respective program display. Pressing the "Test" button will display the next program. If a continuous test of the video board is desired, the "Self-Test" button must be pressed twice so that the video test begins in the auto-test mode. With this program, the device will continuously perform the hardware test until it is turned off. If the display shows "Open Coin Door to Test", the program plug J 19, 1 - 2 must be inserted. With the J 19 plug removed, the memory is protected and the CMOS RAM test video cannot be performed. Hardware tests: These tests are performed as follows: O = off / I = on / X = test results
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each video ROM and compares it with the checksum stored for that ROM. If there is a difference, the device stops and the value of the ROM with the incorrect checksum appears on the LEDs. If the checksum ROM is faulty, U 10 is displayed first. If this test is not successful, the next ROM displayed on the LED display must be replaced. The E-PROM memory in a given game can be introduced as a bank (series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROMs. The E-PROM type for each series is selected by the decoding plug (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732). Communications RAM from the video board
The Communications RAM test determines the reliability of the memory, which is shared by two processors, by storing predetermined series of numbers in the RAM and then checking whether the storage was correct. LED value: 00 0010 If the Gerät with the above display holds, an error has been detected. If the Communications RAMs fail during the video board test, the error may be due to a faulty wiring (RAM) or errors in the data board. To locate the error, remove the data board from P 6 and repeat the test. A failure means: errors in U 3, U 4 or associated power circuits.
Video Board CMOS RAM
After values have been written to another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is tested in the same way as the Communications RAM. If the test is passed, all memory locations are set to their previous value. LED value: 00 0011. If the device is holding the aforementioned display, an error is present. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the associated circuits or decoding.
Check the video board color RAM by storing predetermined number sequences in the color RAM. These number sequences will be checked for correctness when read back. LED value: 00 0100. If this value is displayed, an error is present. Check U 56, U 57, and the multiplexers and decoders associated with them.
Video board (display RAM). The display RAM is checked by writing a pattern on each side. The results of these writes are compared with the original pattern. Any discrepancies cause the program to halt and the LEDs indicate the faulty RAM. If a display RAM fails, identify the problem and replace the RAM. If this error diagnosis does not indicate a RAM failure (00 0101 on LEDs), it indicates that the next test is being started (data hardware). The connection to the data processor must be present and it must be functional.
Unfortunately disappointing
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. This is also the reason for star number 1. The second reason is that the correct jacket arrived without any visible seam defects. BUT I was probably too excited about this jacket, because the disappointment was even greater. I had oriented myself based on other reviews and ordered the jacket in L. Since it was supposed to fit so tightly and I didn't want to fight with an S or M size... In the end, it would have fit in terms of length and at the waist... the rest was too loose. In addition, the lining material was already visible when opening the package and was distributed everywhere. Simply a shame... It will be sent back: /
Fast delivery and good processing
The jacket looks great and we were surprised by the good workmanship. You can wear it on both sides. We ordered it for our daughter and she is thrilled. She usually wears a size 158 and the 36 fits her perfectly in this case and will probably be worn for another year. We can recommend an order.
Robust quality
I chose the rubber pad c because I always work with wood on the car jack and this is not optimal. Unfortunately, I misjudged and the pad does not fit perfectly. But this was my mistake. I then made a slight modification so that it fits. The pad feels very robust and you no longer damage the edges. You can use the groove or the entire surface. It worked without any problems. It does not slip anymore. I would buy it again immediately.
Unfortunately too big for under 1 year olds
The product itself is quite good, but not for children under a year. The surface area for chewing is too large for a small mouth. We bought it when our son was 7 months old and he couldn't use it because of its size. Now, at 12 months old, we have looked for it again and he can use it. He hasn't been able to bite anything with his few existing teeth, and if it was in the fridge, it would calm him down a lot.
Quality is not sufficient / Unfortunately, it is declining
I must admit that I was blinded by the sometimes exaggerated reviews. I would like to preface this by saying that I already have two Lowepro backpacks in use. One is very large (for storing equipment) and the other is quite small for the most important everyday items that you might want to take with you. Since I recently bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the small Lowepro backpack is now too small for me and I need a replacement. I bought this backpack during Prime Day for a really affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy with this purchase, having read many of the reviews beforehand. When the backpack arrived yesterday, however, reality set in: the backpack is not bad for under 30 EUR, but it cannot compete with the well-known products, which are sold at much higher prices... People, that is simply not true! I had really hoped that it was, but that cannot be the case. The padded walls are much thinner and do not offer the same protection as my Lowepro. The dividers inside are of a different caliber, much flimsier. Overall, the feel of this backpack cannot be compared to my Lowepro. The zippers for traveling and the materials of the compartments for small items are not particularly high quality. Therefore, I have decided that the backpack will be returned. If I purchase equipment worth many thousands of EUR, then I must unfortunately also invest in a decent backpack. It seems that quality does indeed have its price. For someone who does not want to spend much money, the backpack is probably a good choice, but not for me. And it is not that the decision was difficult for me. As soon as I opened the backpack, I knew after two minutes that it would be returned. What I did like was the color inside. Here, you will find your things much faster than with a gray interior. For someone who has different requirements for a backpack, the backpack is probably a great thing, but mine is going back.
Unfortunately disappointed by the third part
So far, the E. L. Todd electricity series had been my favorite, but my opinion changed with this book. I found the first two books very strong and recommended, and I was really looking forward to the third part. In this part, the whole story revolves around Volt and Taylor's feelings, and I found it unnecessary to drag it out. Taylor has been swooning over Volt for so long, finally confesses everything to him, and then acts like a child in every argument and runs away?! At the same time, there were inconsistencies, in my opinion, because at the end of the second part, Volt still tried to convince Taylor's ex and didn't believe him when he said that Taylor would stand by him and tried to convince the ex that Taylor couldn't do without him and he had heard it himself. But at the beginning of the third part, it seems that Volt has forgotten everything and is fighting for Taylor. I had hoped that this would be the last part of the series and think that this part is the weakest and also quite unnecessary. I will still read the fourth part and hope that it finally comes out that Taylor's girlfriend Sarah is Volt's ex. This would bring more excitement to the story.
People destroy everything, do not know how to appreciate anything and do not learn to do so! First of all: the film is not that bad, as many people write. Of course, the story is totally contrived and conceived according to the same pattern F. If you have seen the beginning, you know how the end is. And the message is always the same: people destroy everything, do not know how to appreciate anything and do not learn to do so! And that is exactly what the film wants to tell us! How many times have I thought during the film (and even though I know it is just a film and the animals come from the computer): oh my God, the poor animals, it often makes me cry. Therefore, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is really well made. It is just a shame that people do not understand the message behind the film, even though it is a mainstream film. We consistently destroy the animals and the environment and ultimately our planet and ourselves. Out of greed and stupidity and arrogance! No empathy for the environment and living beings: none to be seen. 4 stars, because the film is well made, but unfortunately always according to the same principle, otherwise 5 stars would have been included. Nevertheless, well-made popcorn cinema.
A quiet, sensitive film
Some people are expecting an 8 Mile-style film. This film is not a Hollywood blockbuster and does not want to be one. This film is above all "French" - it is also quiet, sensitive, empathetic, authentic and makes you cry - if you let yourself be drawn in and do not expect anything from it that it does not want to be.
Problematic
Taste like Quench from the 90s, but who cares about orange? 5 days every morning a pack: nothing has changed, but nothing at all. My waistline has grown by 12 cm! Bloating like never before! After that, diarrhea 5-8 times a day. Not very helpful, unfortunately despite immediate discontinuation the diarrhea has been present for 1 week. It should be noted that only 2 stars were given for the smaller package size (unfortunately only noticed too late), but 5 stars for the larger package. That is very strange!
Terrible smell and poor result! I dyed my blonde hair into a chocolate brown with an intense dye in October, and in February/March I used this hair color remover. I used the product twice. The first time I noticed right away that it stinks terribly! However, there was still not a bad result, it came out as a sort of chestnut brown (a bit darker). Since I had not achieved my desired result, I used it one more time, as in the instructions for unsatisfactory results. This time it was a complete waste of time! It made no difference, my hair looked the same as the first time. What was even worse, it still smelled weeks after use, no matter how many times I washed my hair, the smell just wouldn't go away.
Highly recommended.
I have been taking the tablets for a long time now, always one tablet every 5 days. My vitamin balance has been in the basement for a long time due to my job, not enough exercise and a long-term illness. I wanted to help my immune system not only through healthy eating but also by taking vitamin D3 and K2. This works very well. I feel fitter and much better. I sleep better and wake up better. The price is also great because you have to consider how long you can take the tablets. Absolutely recommended.
The function is not entirely flawless!!! After using the battery case for 3 months, I have discovered the following major defects which I find very annoying: 1) The case has problems connecting to the phone over time. This means that charging no longer occurs even though the "Power On/Off" button has been pressed for 3 seconds. When you remove the phone from the case and reinstall it, the problem is solved in 70% of cases, but this creates a new defect. 2) Frequent removal and reinstallation of the phone in the case has caused the cover to wear out so much that it detaches from the case on its own, which is why I have almost lost it several times. These are not many major defects, but I find that a case with a battery should function flawlessly in its function, and therefore I am very disappointed with the product, especially since I have only been using it for 3 months, and for the cost of 30€.
Viei is too expensive, too thin and disappointing
I don't know how these good reviews came about. In the end, it's actually just a glass cleaning cloth that you can get as a gift from any optician in a slightly smaller size. The cleaning effect is as good as a kitchen towel and not better. I expected much more from these cloths. It is also very thin. Unfortunately, I can't exchange it anymore since I've used it. I'm disappointed and can't recommend it from my side. The price for these cloths is far too high. More than 2 euros should not be given.
I doubt the frequency response
I bought this speaker for the shower when my smaller free speaker, which I received as a promotional gift, unfortunately broke. Basically, the Onforu works great, is waterproof (I accidentally dropped it in the shower), gives bass like bass, Bluetooth works great... The suction cup must be moistened, otherwise it will come off... it can play very loudly... yes.. what I see as critical is the frequency response of this small speaker. As I said, bass is played back as bass and not converted into a higher frequency. However, this causes a problem. Some frequencies are played back very loudly while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of the singing are almost painful in the ears, higher and lower frequencies are just good enough to be heard. My old speaker did not play bass well as bass, but the frequencies were represented in the volume quite naturally. With the Onforu, this is unfortunately not really the case, which I find a bit annoying. Therefore, I have to take off a star. I expected more from the frequency response.
very bad
In a few places the color had split and if you just walked over it with your hand, the color would also come off in some places. We wanted to have them picked up for free because we didn't want to keep them anymore, but unfortunately only at our expense. They would only replace the damaged parts, but as if both pieces of furniture were damaged. Poor service from the manufacturer Amazon has taken care of everything for us and refunded us the money. A big thank you to Amazon.
It's better to spend a little more money.
The price is relatively low, which is reflected in the quality. The delivered parts have to be glued together oneself. The product was packaged in a simple envelope made of thin cardboard. There was no additional protection. Since the postman stuffed the product right into my mailbox, a few templates were damaged. I did not complain, as I urgently needed this product. The glue supplied barely holds, but sticks well - like chewing gum that does not harden. Already one day after gluing, almost half of the templates had fallen off the wooden sticks. Since the adhesive does not dry out (at least it was still not dry five days after gluing), one has to be very careful not to glue everything together. The templates are partially incomplete. For one-time use and as a gag for a party, it's okay, but for a wedding I would invest more money and opt for a high-quality product.
I am not unhappy. The cabinet looks good and is easy to assemble, even if the instructions are not very clear. + Magnetic locking system + nice appearance + stable when assembled + shelf can be positioned as desired
- Doors slamming due to magnets (this can perhaps be compensated with rubber bumpers) - some dirty spots
- the supplied dowels are much too small and wobbly (I didn't have any others and there was no trophy in the house, so I glued them in place with craft glue) - the holders for the shelf are a bit wobbly (I wrapped them in paper and leveled them) Conclusion: If it didn't look so good and have such good measurements, I would give it fewer stars, as you have to make everything fit to be truly satisfied. I also find it a bit too expensive for that.
The coffee tastes good...but
...there are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, but I think the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive). In this regard, I would have given 5*. Unfortunately, the coffee does not run through evenly (if at all!). The additional plastic waste (individually packaged, see photo) means a star deduction for me. I hope the manufacturer will change this and soon receive full marks.
It's set for the alarm clock.
The alarm clock arrived quickly and everything is easy to set up. But: the natural sounds sound terrible, and extremely loud at that. I couldn't make them any quieter. It's probably a defect, but apparently that's possible. The quietest radio setting was also too loud for me, so I would immediately fall out of bed. In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can cast shadows on the wall with your hand. I always woke up when I turned my face towards the alarm clock, because I thought it was already tomorrow. But when it actually got to that point and the sunrise simulation began, it was immediately too bright for me. I liked the colors and the color changes, but unfortunately, you can't dim the colored light. I also liked that it had a battery, so that if there is a power outage, the clock and the wake-up time don't have to be re-entered. But I went back on this because of the reasons mentioned.
Lighting is great, processing is inadequate
I replaced four light bulbs in the house with these lamps. Unfortunately, I could only replace four, as the other two were delivered without a socket - instead, a circuit board is laughing at me at this point... There was also nothing in the box. "Buy 6, get 4" is not a good deal. Amazon would certainly have resolved this kindly and quickly, but I only found out after the return deadline. So, I see this as my mistake and I live with it. However, it is not a good indication of the quality of these light bulbs - so far the only reason for two stars being deducted. The light itself is great. The rooms are now very brightly and evenly lit. The light color is more in the direction of cool white. Perfect for hallways, offices, workshops, laundry rooms, etc. For living rooms, I would personally opt for warmer light. Comparable to a good old 100 watt bulb. Other lamps can also do this and maybe I will get intact examples corresponding to the order. If my review is helpful, I would be happy about a positive rating. I try to answer questions quickly.
Tolle
I have received gestures and I would like to share my first impression. Yes, it is positive. I have been thinking for a long time whether to order this set or not. **The material is stable and it feels good in the hand. **The utensils all have a hole at the handle to be able to hang them up ** The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is particularly practical to use on pans with a coating. **They are heat-resistant and can be used up to 440 ℉. **They also do not transfer heat and can therefore be touched directly. **The dishwasher sometimes leaves water stains on the black silicone, but they disappear quickly after wiping. In the end, I must say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend it.
Selling B-grade goods as new.
Amazon Prime shipping is just great. Delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, unpacking the faucet and checking all the parts. We found that the part had already been installed before. We had to note significant scratches and abrasions on all the mounting parts. The screw connections/hoses were all damaged. Nevertheless, we installed the part in the sink (unfortunately). Only now did we see that there were also scratches/streaks on the chrome-plated faucet itself. This part had probably already been delivered and then returned. We are keeping this faucet and installing it in the sink in the basement because it doesn't matter how it looks. Our conclusion: we will never order such goods from Amazon again, but instead we will spend a little more at the hardware store where we get decent goods. We find it simply sad that customers are being cheated in this way!!!
The product itself is top, but the external sensor unfortunately broke after just 6 months.
In principle, I am very satisfied with this product. The installation was very easy, and the radio range is very good, with no problems with the transmission from the inside to the outside. I also find the design of the device attractive. It is very simple and can be mounted on the wall or placed like a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about six months of use, the device that measures the values outside seems to be broken. The thermometer still seems intact, however, and still displays plausible values. The hygrometer, on the other hand, is probably broken, as it always displays completely astronomical values for the outside air humidity. This is very unfortunate, as the device was mounted outside in a protected place, and is also the reason why I am giving this product only two stars.
Strong mower with a weak catch basket
Apart from the fact that the first delivery attempt is still happily making its way through the Republic with Hermes, without finding its way to me or back to Amazon, the service from Amazon with the triggering of a replacement delivery was as always excellent. The lawnmower arrived quickly and made a good impression. The motor is strong and the cut is beautiful. The noise level is not particularly low, but it is ok. The big downside is unfortunately the collection basket. Firstly, it is only made of hard plastic at the top and bottom, and fabric in between. If you just set it down for a short time when it is full, it will of course be compressed and parts of the contents will fall out. Worse, however, is that the actually practical fill level indicator shows red when the basket is only half full. That would not be so bad if the mower did not then lose large parts of the cut material. Emptying the basket on a large lawn area whenever it is only half full is not the solution. Therefore, I have cleaned the device as well as possible and sent it back. Conclusion: Overall, it is a very good lawnmower, but the unfortunate construction of the collection basket makes it unusable for me.
Good device for monitoring.
I have two of these devices. The device can be easily integrated via the app. The supplied detachable sensor cable is very good and can be extended if needed. The device is solidly built. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but to conserve battery power, they are only displayed once to three times a day (adjustable) in the app. For the following reasons, I am giving only 4 stars. - The soft back of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, can only be closed again quite awkwardly. - One of the two devices is in a room with quite thick walls. This device loses connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device does not reconnect on its own, even if you put it near the router. You have to remove the batteries and put them back in after a short pause, then it connects again. This should work without removing the batteries. There is always an alarm when the connection is lost. - The alarm tone could be a bit louder.
3D Printer Prusa i3 DIY
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I have not yet managed to level the hotbed correctly. The right rear locking screw is completely tightened, but the hotbed is still too high in the back and the screw in the front right is practically falling out, even though it is not tightened at all, even though the hotbed is still too low. The rods that hold the carriage are straight, as is the table. Maybe someone knows what can be done about this, because it is impossible to print anything this way. For assembly: The assembly was relatively problem-free, but one could only show how to lay the cables because otherwise one has to lay them again and again, which is very tiring. I have already written to the support department, but after a week of waiting, I still have not received an answer. Returning it is unfortunately no longer possible. I had expected a little more.
Robust and precise, I am positively surprised.
Unfortunately, my old measuring slide has given up the ghost after many years, so a new one had to be purchased. This one looks very robust and is just as precise after several test measurements. Two batteries are included, so you can start using it right away. The packaging of the slide is simple, but it fulfills its purpose perfectly. Otherwise, the slide does not leave anything to be desired and has all the necessary measuring methods. I can only give it a full score and believe it will last at least as long as the old measuring slide. There is a clear recommendation to buy it and a good measuring instrument belongs in every household.
Disgusting, persistent odor
I bought the bracelet and did not wear it for a while because it emitted a disgusting odor. To this day, the odor has not gone away, even though it was "aired out" constantly. After it was no longer possible to return it, I disposed of it. I would not recommend buying it.
Okay for the price
The stars and balls on this necklace are a bit too big for my taste, which makes it look quite bulky. The larger balls are free to move, which I find quite nice. However, the necklace is made with very simple materials, so I have already had to repair the clasp twice. I think it won't last long, but for the low price, you can't really expect anything high-quality.
Very beautiful piece of jewelry
A beautifully crafted bracelet - and the simple clasp actually holds! You just have to pull the end through the mouth, it cannot come undone, amazing! I have rubbed it with some leather care, which makes it even softer and more comfortable. Just one thing: if you have something magnetic on your arm: the clasp is made of steel!
Unfortunately, it's junk! I was already disappointed after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, making me feel like it was used merchandise. The base station was okay. Now to the function: it only connects after some fiddling... if you stick to the instructions, it doesn't work at all, only after I removed a battery from the base station and put it back in did the transmitters finally connect. Unfortunately, my joy about this didn't last long, because after only an hour, the connection was gone again, even though the transmitters were next to the base station. Also, the display of the three transmitters was very different! All in all, it's not worth using for me! I sent it back! I would definitely advise against buying it, it only causes trouble!
Transport damage
Hello, I had this garden pump before, unfortunately the thread of the internal shaft had rusted after 3.5 years. I bought it again only because I urgently needed it due to the current drought and I knew the connections of the suction line and the discharge line would fit. I hope that the shaft on the previous pump had a production defect and that the current pump will last a little longer. Unfortunately, the new pump had transport damage, the plastic housing was torn and the ventilation slots were broken. The box was also damaged from the outside, which is why I would recommend packaging the pump better in the future, rather than just using a thin cardboard box. I kept the pump anyway, because as described above, I urgently needed the pump and the cracks in the plastic housing did not affect the pump's performance.
It could have been better thought out. Since I often have to deal with many different keys, I thought an organizer would be more convenient than carrying around a huge key ring. At first, everything went quite well. However, the finish soon wore off and the screws had to be tightened again and again. It's nice that it works with a penny too, but only with a penny. I couldn't find a suitable Phillips screwdriver that wouldn't immediately ruin the whole screw. Now to the most annoying part of the whole thing: attaching the keys. It's nice that you can adjust the screw to different sizes or lengths through the different parts, but once you've screwed it all together, you need pliers to take it apart again. Attaching the keys themselves is simply a game of patience, balance, and dexterity. Finally, the third time I assembled it, the screw broke in the thread and made the whole thing unusable. Conclusion: if at all, only for the necessary keys once and never again, but at that price, you can also buy a cheaper alternative.
Do not quite match the stated dimensions
The zippers are easy to use, the material feels robust and everything is lightweight. Since I have no comparison (my first organizer set), I will only be able to actually judge the product after the first use. Before that, I can already say that the height is lower than stated. At the moment, I can't really imagine packing everything there for a three-week vacation, for example. If necessary, the really big parts can go directly in the suitcase - as before. It should also be noted that 10 parts were delivered, not 8, as there were two smaller bags/pouches in the round cosmetic bag. The processing is not of high quality, but I wanted to mention that anyway. The fact that the cosmetic bag has a different color and is made of a different material than the other bags does not bother me personally. I see the price-performance ratio as a trial price and that is okay.
So lala
So, I ordered it before Christmas and it worked until after Christmas. Now, when I wanted to use it again, it wouldn't work. Battery? Changed. But it still doesn't work. So, I could have just thrown the money in the trash.
Cleaning is always a good thing! The application is simple, but you should be very careful with the brush to avoid damaging the needle. I could not detect any improvement in sound quality on my very high-quality turntable.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. Two black cables were included. The battery life is very long. The sound is definitely completely adequate. I liked that the headphones do not hurt even after wearing them for a long time and are therefore very comfortable. The ear cups are totally soft and pleasant to wear. The weight is also kept very low. Recommendation to buy in this price range.
A nice dress
A very nice dress that is very versatile and can be worn for a variety of occasions. The price-performance ratio is excellent, especially since I also got it at a discounted price. It fits perfectly in my size, I am glad that I didn't order it smaller (it was recommended). I just wish the neckline wasn't so deep and the sleeves could handle a bit more fabric (if you don't have quite as narrow upper arms as the model in the picture). But overall, it's a nice dress for many occasions.
Keep your hands off it. It can't get any worse. I really and truly did not expect such junk to be sold today. The drive is operated on a High End Asus ROG Strix Scar II Gaming Laptop. It is safe to assume that the USB ports provide sufficient power. Nevertheless, it is not possible to operate this drive without interruption. DVDs usually work, but Blu-rays are recognized at most unreliably. The discs have to be inserted multiple times, after which it makes noises like you haven't heard since the 90s from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives. After a few minutes, you can either restart the computer because it won't work anymore or the disc is finally recognized. But in no case should you press pause or jump to a chapter or change the language during the movie or even just do something. This immediately leads to an unfixable freeze. In addition, of course, no Blu-ray software is included. If you buy PowerDVD or similar at an additional cost, the price of this drive doubles.
It does what it's supposed to do, but it's not pretty. First of all, I would like to point out that the two USB ports are actually a sham, because only the port that faces up is a USB port. The other plug is only there to charge some devices and is therefore relatively useless. I didn't know this when I bought it, which is why I was a little disappointed. I actually needed a second port and if I had just needed a plain extension, I certainly wouldn't have bought this unsightly lump with gold-plated plugs. But apart from the appearance and my misjudgment, the extension fulfills its duty very reliably. And because of the weight of the plug, the inserted USB stick doesn't just hang around in the area, like with a normal extension cord. So it wasn't a real mistake, but my euphoria is kept within reasonable limits :-).
Small but mighty! I bought this product so that I could connect an audio output and a display to my iPad (Pro). With iOS 12, you can now also move data back and forth. This works very well. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Other adapters that I had to send back were unfortunately not able to do this. The HDMI output is practical. I now have a PS4 controller connected via BT to the tablet and the HDMI is connected to the TV. Charging at the same time is no problem. The sound is delivered via HDMI. What else do I need my PlayStation for? :P There was a small adapter included that can be attached to the tablet. This is supposed to provide stability and also has a magnetic holder. With my case, it doesn't fit with the adapter. Well, it still holds securely and has contact, so... All in all, it's a bit expensive, but justified by the full range of functions. It's also very small and made of aluminum, which is stable. Price and performance match.
A lot of performance
Top device. It has been running without problems for months. It is not exactly light or quiet, but it delivers a lot of power. I find the middle temperature setting (Tp setting) a bit too cool and am therefore always on level 2. It has also fallen onto the tiled floor several times and has survived well. And I also like the simple design. Competitor products sometimes look like spaceships.
Very good
The processing of the brush head left a very good impression, even though the price difference compared to the original is very large, but does not make a cheap impression. In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed. Overall, I found these brushes to be very good and can be recommended without reservation.
Great product with weak battery.
We have had the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised. In live mode, the tracking is accurate to within 0.5m. However, when the dog is in the house, it sometimes jumps a few meters, but this is not a problem. I would buy it again anytime. What would be great, however, would be a battery that lasts longer. Currently, it lasts about 1.5 hours. A solution that could last 7-14 days would be great. There is an XL version, but unfortunately, it is too big for our taste. The battery would not have to last that long and we find it impractical to have to change it every day. You should be busy with the dog, not with its collar:-). The app also worked perfectly.
After a few weeks of rubbish
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They fit well and seem comfortable too, but the lifespan is decreasing. Although my son only wears the shoes in PE, the soles are already falling apart after just a few weeks and the shoes cannot be used any longer. With the last pair, it was also the case that they did not last very long in normal use, but I thought it would be enough for PE. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The shoes are expensive rubbish and absolutely not recommended.
Fits perfectly - but original? My last pair of Crocs unfortunately broke after 5 years, so I ordered new ones with pleasure. These ones are unfortunately poorly made at first glance. They are just as comfortable as the ones I had before. At first glance, there seems to be no difference, but upon closer inspection, one can see that the edges are poorly made and the strap at the heel fits quite loosely and is very likely not going to last five years like my previous ones did. I'm curious!
Surprisingly good
Since there are hardly any reviews to read yet, I was initially very skeptical. However, since I am going to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I ordered them on a whim. The delivery included the mattress and a car air pump. Regarding the mattress: I tested it out in my car (Citroen Berlingo) and noticed that there was some mold on one side. I wiped it away and hope that it doesn't come back. In the inflated state, a lying test was conducted immediately. It is comfortable to lie on and fits perfectly for the festival. Of course, this mattress cannot replace one's own bed, but for days at the event, it is pure luxury. The mattress fits perfectly in my car. Beforehand, we removed the seats in the back. It fits perfectly. The air pump: The air pump has different adapters. The mattress requires two different adapters, which can also be found on the pump. The pump is plugged into the cigarette lighter of the car. However, the plug was defective (something to do with the soldering). My boyfriend is handy, so he was able to fix it and it worked perfectly again. The part worked great and pumped up the mattress in no time at all. Overall, I am very impressed with the mattress. I am looking forward to the hardness test at the festival. I hope that it does not lose air and lasts a long time. Also, that the mold does not come back. After the test, I can already recommend it. If I have any other experiences, I will revise the review accordingly (if possible).
Definitely not worth more than 10€... Unfortunately, the calendar only gets two stars from me. :( 1. For the fast shipping. 2. For the idea of the toy. Unfortunately, the calendar is torn through the cheap processing directly on day 1 through several doors. At door 21, there were no more doors left and I had to more or less allow my son to remove the remaining parts as they had already come off. The parts often come out mixed up, which often means that you have to disassemble the car again to put the parts back together. After the car is completely built, parts fall off during play (mostly the windshield. This is also very difficult to put back on again.) In general, I would not buy this calendar again and would not recommend it to anyone else. Maybe the manufacturers will reconsider the way they designed the calendar for the next edition and do it better. :\
a real drone
I am delighted with the drone. My 7-year-old daughter flies it. It flies very well indoors and the 5-minute flight time is usually more than enough. I didn't expect anything different from the price in terms of hair getting caught in it and the drone breaking quickly, but crashes from the ceiling to the floor, whether it's tiles or carpet, are no problem. If you have any questions, the contact is nice.
The game is okay, but it can only be played with a Steam code. I didn't notice when I bought it that it was not a game CD, but only a code that allows you to download the game. That would be okay, but you are forced to install Steam in order to play the game at all, which is an outrage. Since then, the computer has been constantly crashing, which would not be the case with a simple installation of the game.
Unfortunately, it fails due to the battery runtime.
I was really looking forward to the watch. The design and appearance are great, messages etc. are displayed without any problems. The operation works well... and yet I am sending it back. The big problem: the battery and its runtime. Charged in the evening, just rested on the shelf overnight and in the morning 11% less battery when not in use. If many messages come in during the day, the battery is already dead by noon / early afternoon and then you can't even read the time. Therefore, not useful for me. Very unfortunate.
A noble shell with limitations
For the sleazy Samsung Galaxy S10+, you should definitely get a case. Recently, I have liked cases that also allow you to insert a credit card. This is what the case here offers. If you insert cards into all three compartments, it becomes too much, then the lid stands up a bit. One is enough for me. The leather case gives a robust impression and seems to be well made. It looks elegant. The phone is embedded around it, only the ports have cutouts. Otherwise, you can easily operate the power button and volume control on the sides through the case. The disadvantage is that it is not possible to charge the phone on some QI chargers due to the thickness of the case. Even on the leather QI charging station from TORRO, it does not work. Accessories - such as the Galaxy Buds - can only be charged when the case is off. Otherwise, it looks really cool and well made!
High-quality case with bulletproof glass film
The robust case with a real bulletproof glass as protection for the screen in a classic design offers all-round protection for the entire iPhone 11. It fits very well and can also be easily put on. The material is pleasant to hold and does not get dirty. A truly successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio. This case gives the phone some stability. It is not too bulky and fits firmly on the phone. Overall, a good purchase.
