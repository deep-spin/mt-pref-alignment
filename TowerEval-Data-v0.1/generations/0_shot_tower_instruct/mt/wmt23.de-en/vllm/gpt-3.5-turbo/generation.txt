Diego Cocca becomes the new national coach of Mexico.
In the summer of 2026, Mexico, together with the USA and Canada, will host the World Cup with 48 teams for the first time. Cocca succeeds Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not renewed after the early World Cup exit in Qatar. The 50-year-old was not considered a favorite for the position until a few days ago. He had only taken over as coach of the Mexican club Tigres in November. His surprising appointment as national coach caused anger within the club.
Geesthacht: New bed signs should encourage replanting.
Franko Stein (FD Environment, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) are putting up the plant signs in the flower beds of the pedestrian zone.
The "Geesthacht blooms" campaign also includes information about what is currently blooming there - currently in the colors white and pink.
Geesthacht. "Geesthacht is blooming" is the name of an initiative by Nabu in cooperation with the municipal administration. With the participation of many volunteers from associations, schools, kindergartens, companies, and institutions, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been planted since 2015. The goal is to create extensive flowering islands in the Geesthacht city area, where insects can find food at any time. "In favorable weather conditions, bees start flying out in January to search for food," says Friedhelm Ringe from Geesthacht's Nabu. He himself has beehives on his property.
So that the endeavor does not remain just an action by conservationists and the environmental department of the city, but reaches far into private gardens, explanatory signs about the plants are repeatedly placed. There are currently about 50 signs. Passersby should be able to inform themselves about what is currently blooming here. The hope is that hobby gardeners will plant similar species at home.
In the first week of January, the wild hazel season has already started.
Of more recent date are shrubs such as winter sweet honeysuckle and winter snowball in the flower beds of the pedestrian zone. They have been planted in the pots on Bergedorer Straße for a year now, currently showing their first delicate white and pink blossoms without leaves, and have recently been provided with additional signs. "The winter sweet honeysuckle is a very bushy shrub and can grow to be between two meters high and three meters wide," is among the further information about the suitable location to be read there.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that not only the bedding plants are now showing flowers. In the first week of January, the wild hazel already started blooming. It blooms particularly abundantly on Richtweg near the incline, on Gutenbergstraße, Wilhelm-Holert-Straße, Fahrendofer Weg, and many hedges.
Ernestine is 102 years old: "Dancing keeps me young"
Munich - Dance god Fred Astaire would surely be proud of her if he looked down from heaven to Munich's Ostbahnhof!
Every Monday, three ladies meet at the "Mandolin Motion Show Academy" at exactly 3 pm for a lively tap dance - together, they are an incredible 277 years old, pardon, young!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, she recently celebrated her 102nd birthday.
For the native Munich resident (January 15, 1921) from Schwanthaler Höh, Monday is THE highlight of the week. "Dancing and tap dancing is my life, I can't imagine it without it."
With Ernestine, Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) also swing their dancing legs.
The 97-year-old was born in Jena (Thuringia) in 1926. She was a soubrette, today one would say musical performer, and worked with the legendary Marika Rökk. "I have spent my life with dancing, acting, and singing."
At 79 years old, Elfriede Widmann is somewhat like the chick in the group of tap dancers. She says, "We simply have fun here with our dance teacher Sissy Engl."
Wikipedia: Tap dance was developed in the United States in the 19th century and is now known worldwide. With two metal plates attached to the front and back of the shoes, which are more durable than the initially used wooden soles, rhythmic sounds are produced while dancing, which match the visual impression and the music. The dancer thus also becomes a percussion musician. The English term for this is onomatopoeic "Tap dance" and the French term is "Claquettes". The Spanish Flamenco may have influenced tap dance. In this style, the tips of the shoes are nailed to produce a well audible sound while dancing.
The 77-year-old Sissi Engl is the heart and soul of the dance studio at Ostbahnhof. She is an actress, dancer, and choreographer. "We are a big family, where young and old, and people of all ages are welcome."
And what is the recipe for such a long life? "Movement keeps me young," says the 102-year-old to BILD. Her advice to everyone: "Exercise, healthy eating, and no alcohol."
Analog in Dialogue - The Limits of the Digital
With advancing digitalization, the desire for analog is growing again for some.
The rapid pace at which our everyday life became digital left us little time to establish rules for dealing with it and to adapt our communication and work methods accordingly, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden. In 1985, if you wanted to make a phone call in Bautzen, there were three options. Either you belonged to the lucky six percent who had a private connection. Or you belonged to those who had someone from this exclusive group in the neighborhood and could make a call to their relatives there in exchange for a bottle of Radeberger beer. Or you went to a telephone booth. Unforgettable was the smell of the plastic receiver and the clicking of the coins in the vending machine. My biggest dream was to be able to see the other person's face while making a call - video telephony, I thought, what a great thing that would be!
What's next in Moldova? 14 days for a new government
In Moldova (also: Moldavia), President Maia Sandu has entrusted former Interior Minister Dorin Recean with the formation of the government.
The 48-year-old economist now has 14 days to do so. So far, Recean has been one of the advisors to the president.
After only one and a half years in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita unexpectedly resigned. The pro-European government leader was under immense pressure, as she herself stated as an explanation for her resignation - apparently, she was being targeted by pro-Russian forces.
The president thanked Gavrilita for her "enormous sacrifices".
Moldova is a neighboring country of Ukraine and is suffering from the economic consequences of the war. Inflation is over 40 percent and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the parliament in Chisinau, the pro-European party PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity), founded by President Sandu, has a comfortable majority as it occupies 63 out of 101 seats. Therefore, the confirmation of the new prime minister and his cabinet should not be a problem.
However, the pro-European politicians in Moldova have lost popularity in recent months, while the pro-Russian ones, with support from the Kremlin, have become more popular.
These were the costumes of the celebrities.
In 2023, there will be proper celebrations again in Veitshöchheim. The fifth season is in full swing and the celebrities didn't hesitate for long.
State father Markus Söder did not go as Moses, as his costume suggests. He sees himself more as the tribal elder of Bavaria. At his side is his wife Karin Baumüller-Söder.
Bavaria's Minister for the Environment and Consumer Protection, Thorsten Glauber, has chosen the children's hero Chase from Paw Patrol for his costume.
From the depths of the sea, Justice Minister Georg Eisenreich and his wife Anja came to Franconia.
Completely out of this world: Minister for Science and Art, Markus Blume, is heading to space.
The President of the State Parliament, Ilse Aigner, chose none other than "Mama Bavaria" as her role model for her costume.
In peace and love mode: Bavaria's Minister of Health Klaus Holetschek with his wife Birgit.
Bob the Builder alias Minister of Construction Christian Bernreiter with his wife Ann-Kathrin Jandt-Bernreiter as Wendy.
Bavaria's golden boy: Finance Minister Albert Füracker with his wife Evelyne. She wore silver.
He even plays the sheriff during carnival: Bavaria's Minister of the Interior Joachim Herrmann. By his side, his wife Gerswid.
On the journey: Minister of Economic Affairs Hubert Aiwanger pays homage to craftsmanship with his costume. His partner Tanja Schweiger, district administrator of the Regensburg district, does the same.
The political opposition naturally could not be missing.
Everything for Bavaria: Green Party parliamentary leader Katharina Schulze as Bavaria and her co-leader Ludwig Hartmann as the Bavarian lion.
Hiking is the pleasure of the SPD parliamentary group leader: Florian von Brunn with SPD state chairwoman Ronja Endres.
FDP parliamentary group leader Martin Hagen went for a royal look. He and his wife Anisha came dressed as Harry and Meghan.
Otherwise, he certainly speaks more. In Veitshöchheim, the faction leader in the European Parliament, Manfred Weber, was on the road as a mime. By his side, Mrs. Andrea.
If politics doesn't work out, he can at least do magic. Nuremberg's mayor Marcus König as Harry Potter and his wife Anke as Hermione.
Speeding like a bee on the go: Bavaria's Digital Minister Judith Gerlach.
Back to the 1920s: the legal director of BR, Eva Majuntke, BR director Katja Wildermuth, and BR cultural program director Björn Wilhelm.
A small dig against the climate activists played by Sebastian Fleischer, the detective from the Franconian Tatort, portrayed by Alexander Leopold Schadt.
The first mayor of Veitshöchheim, of course, could not be missing. Jürgen Götz and his wife Julia.
Oberhof: Kühn finishes eighth in the World Championship sprint.
Bö continued his impressive streak despite difficult conditions and won the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic champion has now collected 14 world championship titles and is closing in on his compatriot Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, who is on-site as a TV expert, is still the undisputed record champion with 20 world championship gold medals. Even partial heavy fog did not prevent Bö, the perennial winner, from collecting his second gold at the Rennsteig. On Wednesday, he had already achieved a successful title defense with Norway's mixed relay team.
Hardly anyone doubts that there will be a follow-up in hunting race number three. In the pursuit, Bö is once again the clear favorite. His running form is outstanding, allowing him to compensate for shooting errors surprisingly easily up to a certain extent.
Meanwhile, things were not going well for Doll. After the veteran had squandered all chances of a medal in the mixed relay with a penalty lap at the start, resulting in a sixth-place finish, three days later things did not improve. Three penalty laps in the prone shooting and two more in the standing position were a big disappointment for the oldest member of the German team, who had celebrated the biggest success of his career in this discipline in 2017.
In Hochfilzen, six years ago, he won unexpectedly with a narrow lead of 0.7 seconds ahead of Bö. It was one of only three career successes for Doll, who has so far stood on the podium once this winter. The eighth-place finisher at the Beijing Olympics silently left after his weak performance and initially gave no interviews. Roman Rees finished in 19th place, while the second World Championship debutant, David Zobel, finished in 35th place.
Biden receives Lula: "We must stand up for democracy"
During a meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the main focus is on the value of democracy. Both are looking back at their predecessors.
US President Joe Biden has emphasized the preservation of democratic values during a visit with his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
"The strong democracy of our two nations has been put to the test," Biden said on Friday at the White House in Washington. "We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that are at the core of our strength." Lula responded, referring to his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro: "Brazil has been isolated for four years."
The left-wing politician Lula had prevailed in a runoff against Bolsonaro at the end of October. Lula took office on January 1st. The change of power was accompanied by severe riots. Bolsonaro's supporters stormed the Congress, the Supreme Court, and the government headquarters in the capital Brasília in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil is reminiscent in a gloomy way of the storming of the US Capitol over two years ago, when supporters of then-President Donald Trump forcibly entered the parliament in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro during the meeting with Biden. His predecessor did not care much about international relations. "His world began and ended with fake news, morning, afternoon, and evening," said Lula. "Sounds familiar to me," Biden replied - an obvious allusion to his predecessor Trump.
Short note about the press - der Freitag
Does anyone still remember the RAF wanted posters? They showed the members of the Red Army Faction who were marked for denunciation and shooting.
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which existed even before Corona, public sentiment was stirred up against the most dangerous opponents of the Federal Republic of Germany; let's say the bourgeois democracy, let's say the late capitalist society. (Here, nothing about the truly dangerous ones in pinstripe suits and ties.)
Now the Stuttgarter Zeitung, which is usually more interested in Raudis on the S-Bahn or masturbators in the park, is releasing a new edition featuring Putin's "war criminal" friends. Because they are so beautiful, there is a photo gallery. Of course, the StZ is poorly informed, because in this world, which includes Asia, Africa, and Latin America, there may be more "friends of Russia" than the StZ has space for pictures.
But that's not the point, rather: In positions 1 to 5 (!) is Mrs. Wagenknecht, followed by Mrs. Schwarzer.
Well, I don't know anyone in my surroundings anymore who reads this newspaper. If they do, it would be high time now. We have reached the well-known level where there is nothing below it anymore.
And now, dialectically speaking, Mrs. Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician among all those who are not completely brainwashed, i.e. peace-loving, pacifist, and anti-militarist people. (And now, no further differentiation is necessary.)
Harald Glööckler files for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth
Designer Harald Glööckler (57) and his husband Dieter Schroth (74) have separated. Glööckler's lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser confirmed this to the "Bild" newspaper and RTL in the same wording. It says there: "I can confirm that my client has filed a request for the dissolution of his civil partnership with his family lawyer at the competent court. I will not comment on the details."
Glööckler and his life partner Schroth were together for 35 years, rumors of separation have been circulating for about a year. After his participation in the jungle camp, the fashion designer is said to have already moved from their shared house in the Palatinate to Berlin, according to various media reports. He also spoke about marital problems in the RTL show.
SS Massacre in Oradour-sur-Glane: Last Survivor Dead
In the destroyed village northwest of Limoges, whose ruins were preserved, a memorial center was established in 1999. France's President Emmanuel Macron awarded Hébras with the National Order of Merit a year ago. Macron said that Hébras had fought for freedom and defended the values of France. He also contributed to German-French peace. The survivor had, among other things, advocated for German-French youth encounters.
A curve position for 14 houses: In Homeien, everyone knows everyone.
LZ series North Lippe hamlets: In Homeien, it is not uncommon for three or four generations to live under one roof. Here, residents find pure idyll. In the summer, up to 300 motorcycles per day zoom along the winding route between Niedermeien and Hillentrup - and some even return right away.
Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing considers further interest rate hikes in the fight against high inflation rates to be "absolutely" necessary. "The inflationary risks are still significant. The costs of energy can easily rise again, and the opening of China can temporarily boost prices," Sewing told "Welt am Sonntag" (World on Sunday).
The European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates in the euro area for the fifth consecutive time at the beginning of February and announced the possibility of another increase of 0.5 percentage points for the meeting on March 16. The key interest rate in the euro area is now at 3.0 percent. The deposit rate that commercial banks receive when they park money with the ECB is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates increase the cost of loans. This can slow down demand and counteract high inflation rates. Higher loan interest rates can also lead to postponed investments and therefore weaker economic growth.
Even for highly indebted eurozone countries such as Italy, rising interest rates are a burden. "The consequences of persistently high inflation are much more serious than higher financing costs for some countries," Sewing said. "Of course, we have to keep an eye on that, but a high level of debt must not prevent the ECB from acting consistently."
The ECB aims for price stability in the euro area in the medium term, with an inflation rate of two percent. This target has been far off for months. In January, although the price increase weakened again, consumer prices in the currency area of the now 20 countries were still 8.5 percent higher than in the same month of the previous year.
Higher inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of consumers, as they can afford less for one euro. Sharply increased energy prices, which are a significant driver of inflation, are also a burden for companies.
"If inflation remains high, private consumption will 'sooner or later collapse,' warned Sewing, who is also the President of the Association of German Banks (BdB). 'I currently see this as the biggest threat to the German economy. But I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario.'"
Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung hopes for a broad debate on the "Germany-Speed" in infrastructure projects declared by Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD). "There will have to be a political and social dialogue about it. And it may also be a bit controversial," he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart. He hopes that in the end, a set of rules will emerge that does not necessarily have to be as fast as the LNG terminals that were put into operation around the turn of the year, but also not as slow as before.
In mid-December, after ten months of planning and construction, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened. The goal was to partially close the gap in gas supply due to the lack of Russian gas deliveries. Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) spoke of a new "German speed" on this occasion. In addition, the federal government recently initiated an acceleration of approval procedures for wind turbines and power lines.
"First of all, it is very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it matters. However, this should not automatically mean that we will always act categorically from now on and, for example, put a wind turbine in the neighbor's garden against their will," said Hartung. Therefore, there must still be a negotiation process about what society considers right and wrong.
In the past, they tried it with the classic set of rules and failed. "We should reconsider whether the previous approach was correct. Maybe we also exaggerated with the set of rules and made it too complicated for ourselves."
In view of the many pending tasks, such as the expansion of power lines, Hartung said he does not envy the federal government and the companies involved. "As a consumer of these energies, I absolutely need the expansion and it should be as green as possible."
Union warns against dismantling of Bayer Group
The chemistry trade union IG BCE warns of a breakup of the Bayer corporation following an announced change in leadership. "From the employees' perspective, Bayer is perfectly positioned for the challenges of the future with its three pillars," said Francesco Grioli, board member of the union and member of the Bayer supervisory board, to the "Rheinische Post" (Saturday edition).
The source text translates to:
Background is the announced change in leadership at the pharmaceutical and agrochemical company on Thursday. The controversial CEO Werner Baumann will step down this summer. Taking over in early June will be Bill Anderson, the former pharmaceutical chief of Swiss rival Roche.
Baumann has long been under criticism. The 2018 acquisition of US seed manufacturer Monsanto for $63 billion continues to haunt the manager. With the purchase, the Leverkusen-based company brought expensive legal disputes over alleged cancer risks of the herbicide glyphosate upon itself. Bayer's stock has been in decline for years. In 2019, shareholders even refused to grant the CEO discharge at the annual general meeting.
It has been known for some time that Baumann does not intend to extend his contract, which was originally supposed to run until 2024. Long-term oriented strategic investors had exerted pressure. Recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors such as Bluebell Capital have also become involved. According to a media report, Bluebell is pushing for a breakup of the company.
The very small fund with an unknown stake in Bayer is known for its aggressive approach. "A spin-off of the Consumer Health division would be a possible way to increase the company's value," said Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, to the "Rheinische Post". However, he does not consider a spin-off of the much larger Crop Science division to be feasible.
Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate against pension reform.
Paris
On Saturday, the French are once again planning to take to the streets to protest against the proposed pension reform.
The unions are opposing the government's project with a concentrated protest on the streets. Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate again on Saturday against the pension reform.
In France, hundreds of thousands of people are once again expected to demonstrate nationwide on Saturday against President Emmanuel Macron's planned pension reform. For the fourth time, the trade unions are mobilizing against the plans of the centrist government to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. Twice already, over a million people took to the streets and there were nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 participants were counted in the protests. A turbulent debate on the controversial reform has been ongoing in parliament for a week.
Already now, many people in France work beyond the age of 62 if they have not contributed enough for a pension without deductions by reaching the retirement age. Opponents of the reform argue that in many physically demanding professions, people would hardly be able to work longer. Additionally, workers want to be able to enjoy their well-deserved retirement and not completely wear out their health in their job.
Macron: Looming deficit in pension fund
Macron justifies the reform with an impending deficit in the pension fund. Because the population is getting older, employees would have to contribute to an increasing number of retirees with their contributions. In order to maintain the level of pensions, the population would have to work a little more. Critics doubt the government's calculations and demand that the state find other sources of funding to keep the pension system in balance.
But the government wants to make changes not only to the retirement age. The previously decided increase in the required contribution period for a full pension is to be accelerated. In addition, individual pension systems with privileges for certain professional groups are to be abolished. The minimum pension is to increase to around 1200 euros.
The pension reform is considered one of President Macron's most important projects. During the Corona pandemic, a first attempt to implement the reform was abandoned, and even then there were massive protests and strikes. Several presidents before Macron have tried, with varying degrees of success, to reform the French pension system - widespread protest and strikes were guaranteed for all of them.
Since Macron's party no longer has an absolute majority in parliament, it hopes to push through the reform with the help of the conservative Républicains, who have announced their support. However, some of the deputies - even from Macron's own party - still have reservations. And at the moment, Macron's concern about paralyzing strikes is even greater than the fear of a close vote. Before the demonstrations on Saturday, the President said that he could rely on the organizers' sense of responsibility to ensure that they proceeded calmly and did not lead to a blockade of the country.
Quiet weather expected - lots of sun in high altitudes
A powerful high-pressure system is located over Central Europe and determines the weather in Germany. Does this mean that there will be a lot of sunshine everywhere?
Offenbach
In Germany, calm high-pressure weather is expected at least until midweek. "When looking at the weather maps, a powerful high-pressure area directly over Central Europe immediately catches the eye," explains meteorologist Markus Übel from the German Weather Service on Saturday in Offenbach. "Although this high will shift slightly to the east over the course of next week, it will continue to determine the weather in Germany."
However, calm high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Übel. "Such a high-pressure system can even be quite mean and bring people in the lowlands days of dreary high fog gray, while there is pure sunshine in the highlands of the low mountain ranges."
So the Sunday starts foggy and cloudy in most regions. According to the DWD, it may still rain a little from the Erzgebirge and the Thuringian Forest to Lower Bavaria. Especially at the edge of the Alps, but also in the southwest and partly in the west, the cloud cover will break up during the day and the sun will increasingly come out. In the rest of the country, it remains mostly cloudy or covered with high fog. Temperatures reach 4 to 9 degrees, around 10 degrees near the Rhine.
"On Monday, the gradually strengthening sun will nibble away at the high fog and dissolve it more and more throughout the day," says the meteorologist. Sunshine is expected all day in the Alpine region, in the high elevations of the low mountain ranges, and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, while elsewhere it will have to fight its way through the high fog layer. The maximum temperatures range from 5 to 9 degrees Celsius, around 11 degrees Celsius in the Lower Rhine region, while in the persistent grayness in the southeast, only around 3 degrees Celsius are expected. In addition, there will be a weak wind blowing from different directions.
On Tuesday, there may again be only slow dissipation of fog or low-lying clouds in some areas. Otherwise, the weather will be clear after the fog clears. According to the forecasts, the sun will shine all day in high-altitude areas, in large parts of NRW, and along the Alpine foothills. Depending on the sunshine, temperatures will climb to 5 to 11 degrees.
Dominatorin struggles: Goggia once again misses out on a World Championship medal.
The beaten top favorite Sofia Goggia showed herself to be deeply disappointed after her elimination in the downhill race of the Alpine Ski World Championships.
Méribel
"I am sad because I did not deliver the performance that I am capable of," said the Italian woman on ZDF after she had caused a goal and was eliminated. At least the 30-year-old was able to prevent a potentially serious fall.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill skier in the World Cup for years. She has won four out of the six season races in this discipline so far. After winning gold in Pyeongchang in 2018, she won silver at the 2022 Olympic Winter Games in Beijing. However, Goggia, who is known for her risky driving style, still has to wait for a medal in her specialty discipline at the World Championships. She was absent from her home game in Cortina d'Ampezzo two years ago due to injury.
"I actually thought I was in a good mood. It was about hundredths of a second," said Goggia after the surprising victory of the Swiss Jasmine Flury in Méribel, France. "I am disappointed. I gave it my all. But that's life." Sometimes you believe things are guaranteed, she said about the expected and ultimately missed medal by all experts: "But they're not."

Zelensky and ministers against Russia's participation in the Olympics
Kiev. Sport politicians from 35 nations have increased pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) by demanding the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris.
It was announced on a joint telephone conference that an agreement was reached to draft a statement in order to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sports competitions, the Lithuanian Ministry of Sports announced on its website.
"We demand the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues," said Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė.
The video consultation took place on the initiative of Great Britain. British Sports Minister Lucy Frazer wrote on Twitter that it had been a very productive meeting. "And I made Britain's position very clear: as long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus should not be represented at the Olympic Games. We will now issue a joint statement on this matter."
Previously, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky protested against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions during an international video conference of sports ministers and other high-ranking representatives. "While Russia kills and terrorizes, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions," said Zelensky. He published his speech on his Telegram channel. Due to the Russian war of aggression, a neutral flag is ultimately soaked in blood and not wearable.
Ukraine threatens with boycott
Ukraine also sees Belarus as a party to the war because the country provides military bases to Russian troops for attacks. Selenskyj called on officials to advocate for the protection of Olympic principles and prevent the admission of Russian athletes to the competitions. The president also reiterated his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which has unfortunately lost its "honesty".
The reason for the conference was the announcement by the IOC to allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international competitions under certain conditions. Ukraine also threatens to boycott if the IOC allows the athletes.
Even the Federal Ministry of the Interior takes a position.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior, responsible for sports, stated afterwards that it had also reaffirmed its rejection of allowing Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete in Paris during the consultations. "From our perspective, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian sports to return to the competitions. Ukrainian athletes must continue to receive the unconditional solidarity and support of the international sports community. The IOC's efforts to reintegrate Russian and Belarusian athletes are the wrong approach," a spokesperson for the Ministry of the Interior said in response to a dpa inquiry.
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) had already emphasized at the end of January: "Sport should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against the Ukrainian civilian population. Major sporting events do not take place in a vacuum." Russia, on the other hand, emphasizes that sport and politics must be separated.
Currently, Russia and Belarus are excluded from many international sports competitions. However, the IOC aims for the return of athletes from both countries to the international sports stage under a neutral flag, provided that they clearly commit to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach recently stated that an exclusion "due to a passport or place of birth" would violate the prohibition of discrimination.
To criticize where it happens
"Hey, nice ass!" Whistling at the woman in a skimpy sexy costume and making suggestive remarks: All of this falls under the term "catcalling". Behind this term lies nothing less than a form of verbal sexual harassment in public spaces.
Half of the vehicles lost? : USA see Moscow's tank inventory greatly reduced
Half of the vehicles lost? USA sees Moscow's tank inventory greatly reduced.
The Pentagon assumes that Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the beginning of the war. It is said to be "half of the main inventory".
According to the US Department of Defense, the Russian army has already lost half of its combat tanks in its war of aggression against Ukraine. "Presumably, half of the main stock of tanks" of the Russian army has been "destroyed or seized by Ukraine," said Celeste Wallander, Under Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs in the US Department of Defense.
Wallander did not provide any further information on the number of tanks confiscated and destroyed according to US estimates during an online event organized by the think tank Center for a New American Security.
The Ukraine is set to receive several combat tanks from several Western allies in the coming weeks. Britain has promised to deliver Challenger 2 combat tanks to Kiev in March. Germany, in a coalition with other countries, plans to deliver a battalion of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine by April. The United States has also pledged a battalion of 31 Abrams tanks, although their delivery is expected to take significantly longer.
Russia wants to step up its game.
In response to Western military aid, former Kremlin leader Dmitry Medvedev promised the construction and modernization of thousands of tanks. "As we know, our enemy abroad has begged for airplanes, missiles, tanks," said Medvedev, who is now the Deputy Chief of the Russian Security Council, during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. "It is clear that in this case, it is natural for us to increase the production of various types of weapons and military technology, including modern tanks."
Since last summer, a law has been in effect in Russia that allows for a stronger alignment of the economy with the needs of the army. This means that individual industries can be obligated to supply the armed forces.
Controversy surrounding appointments in the army
Because the position that will be filled by former director of the Museum of Military History (HGM) Christian Ortner in the future was not advertised. The staff representative of the academy, Herwig Jedlaucnik, suspects corruption and abuse of office. Defense Minister Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends the procedure.
A tender is not necessary because the appointment is being made to a previously vacant position, according to the minister. She does not want to comment on the "speculations of a representative of the Freedom Party". Ortner was replaced at the helm of the HGM last year after 17 years. In addition to criticism of the museum's handling of Austria's military past, he was confronted with serious allegations of bullying. From Tanner's perspective, these allegations have been cleared up.
Jedlaucnik also doubts Ortners' suitability in terms of content. He is an expert on the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current issues of security policy.
The SPÖ demands clarification from Tanner about the "unusual ordering process". According to SPÖ defense spokesman Robert Laimer, there is a "suspicion of nepotism" associated with the decision. The Neos are calling on Tanner to withdraw the appointment. The ÖVP is still "neck-deep in the swamp of corruption," said Douglas Hoyos, spokesman for defense. He announced a parliamentary inquiry on the subject.
Carnival: First fools are brought to their knees by costs.
Thuringia's carnival stronghold Wasungen wants to stick to the traditional carnival parade, unlike the state capital. However, the higher costs, including security, are also difficult to manage in Wasungen, says carnival president Marcel Kißling. The funds alone account for approximately half of the estimated total costs for the parade.
In Brandenburg, there are no canceled carnival parades. The "Zug der fröhlichen Leute" in Cottbus, probably once again the largest in East Germany, will take place for the first time after the pandemic. There have also been no canceled parades during the Swabian-Alemannic carnival.
Schleswig-Holstein's carnival stronghold Marne is sticking to the traditional parade despite the increased costs. "We will carry out our event," says the president of the carnival society, Heiko Claußen. But here too, financial worries are pressing: if more sponsors are not found or the existing ones do not contribute more, reserves would have to be tapped into - "that cannot be done every year". The current deficit is about 200,000 euros.
And the inflation: There is a price increase of up to 60 percent for confectionery, says Elvira Reuther from the Nuremberg Carnival Parade Association. Fortunately, too much was ordered in 2020, which is why there is still enough stock this time. However, it is already certain that it will be more expensive for the parade. Twice as much staff will be needed for security as in 2020.
Those who stand on the sidelines of the Rose Monday parade in the Rhineland may receive fewer sweets than before. Because candy has become more expensive, some participants in the parade do not have as much with them. Candy aside, the number of visitors is expected to be high: "I believe that if it doesn't rain buckets on that day, we can definitely expect an increased number of people," says Cologne parade leader Holger Kirsch. "This is due to the fact that there hasn't been a regular Rose Monday parade for two years. The parade cannot be replaced by anything."
The Cologne Festival Committee does not comment on costs in detail. However, the parade is generally "deficitary", that is no secret.
The Ukraine Diary: Dreams and Homemade Vodka
The Ukrainians are rightly known for their ability to drink. There is domestic beer like Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lviv. Every now and then, I discover German beer here. Not Kulmbacher, but other major breweries like Krombacher or Warsteiner. I can't taste a big difference in the taste. The same goes for vodka, which is widely consumed. They distill it themselves, especially in the villages. They call it Samargon. No one knows exactly how much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics. In Russia, the Minister of Health claimed a few years ago that consumption had dropped by a staggering 80 percent in five years. Well, you can see here how little you can trust the Russians. It is said that tourists should be careful with it. But that only applies if they go for mass consumption. There will probably be adulteration there as well.
FC Hansa Rostock rewards itself for high effort: "Match luck on our side"
Food and drink
Those who want to celebrate the weekend with cocktails or have a beer after work will find great places for that in Rostock and Warnemünde. The restaurant scene offers many locations for after-work meetings or pre-gaming for club parties. Where is the best place? A look at the Google reviews will show.
Biathlon World Championships: Federal President predicts victory for the favorites and praises Oberhof.
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are welcomed at the arena by chimney sweep master Tobias Böttger and the Oberhof mascot "Flocke".
Oberhof. The German biathletes had nothing to do with the medal distribution at the Oberhof World Championship sprint. However, there were two bright spots in the fog.
No matter how hard the Federal President tried, it was not possible to see from the VIP stand on Saturday whether the targets on the shooting range were actually falling. "I had to get the results on my phone," Frank-Walter Steinmeier said with a smile, pointing out the fog that repeatedly moved into the stadium and greatly impaired the view for the spectators on the Rennsteig.
Steinmeier still enjoyed the visit to the 10 km sprint race at the Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof, and received numerous tips from Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "Since the Olympic Games in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race, biathlon has fascinated me," he revealed and also praised Oberhof for its modernized sports facilities: "The completely renovated arena is fantastic and offers ideal conditions. The athletes also say so - with thanks to those who have been involved since the awarding of the World Championships." In terms of sustainability, the location is now "one step ahead" of many others and therefore "secure for the next years and even decades."
Once again, the Norwegian Johannes Thingnes Bö left the competition behind in a sporty manner. Despite one penalty lap due to a shooting error, he secured his sixth victory in the sixth sprint of the winter in 23:21.7 minutes - and thus his second world championship title in Oberhof. Behind him, his brother Tarjei, who shot flawlessly, finished 14.8 seconds behind, followed by Sturla Holm Lägreid with one penalty lap and a time of 39.9 seconds, and Johannes Dale with one penalty lap and a time of 43.6 seconds, completing the Norwegian quadruple victory.
The local ski hunters were unable to compete for medals a day after Denise Herrmann-Wick's triumph. Johannes Kühn, with a shooting error and a time lag of 1:04.8 minutes, finished in eighth place as the best German. World Championship debutant Justus Strelow shot flawlessly and finished twelfth (1:14.6). Two bright spots behind the gray veil. On the other hand, Benedikt Doll disappointed once again. After his failed mixed event on Wednesday, the Black Forest native missed five targets this time and disappeared as the 55th, deeply disappointed and without comment, into the cabin.
Bö started the race with number 1 in front of 14,300 spectators and despite the complicated visibility conditions, he solidified this status. However, he was lucky with his last two standing shots; they both landed on the edge of the targets but still fell. The 29-year-old then enjoyed the award ceremony together with his five years older brother: "It is the best feeling to stand here with him," said the world champion. "We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes."
There is hardly any doubt that the Norwegians will also dominate the pursuit on Sunday. In contrast, the German hopes in the women's category rest on Herrmann-Wick. "When you start with number one, the goal is not to finish tenth. It's all about full throttle and attack to defend the number one position," said sports director Felix Bitterling, holding his "locomotive" accountable. The organizers expect a nearly sold-out arena for the double event (1:25 pm and 3:30 pm/ZDF and Eurosport live).
Brych dislikes "bee swarm" on the field
Felix Brych - Referee Felix Brych decides on a referee ball.
Aggressively approaching players or complaining coaches? Germany's referees want to "consistently penalize" unsportsmanlike behavior. Referee chief Fröhlich points out a role model function.
The German top referee Felix Brych has identified negative tendencies in the interaction on the field. "I do think that there are new behaviors from players who swarm around the referee after decisions and try to push him into the review area," said the 47-year-old to the German Press Agency. "We discussed this during the winter break. We have decided that we do not want to accept such unsportsmanlike conduct. We will pay closer attention to it again - and we will also sanction it."
Recently, two coaches were also given red cards. Mainz coach Bo Svensson received a red card during the cup defeat against FC Bayern. Freiburg's coach Christian Streich received a yellow-red card during the league defeat in Dortmund. "Coach behavior also falls into the category of unsportsmanlike conduct. We have noticed that unsportsmanlike conduct has also increased in this area, that the behavior towards referees has become a bit more demanding or aggressive. We also want to consistently penalize such unsportsmanlike conduct," said Brych.
DFB referee chief Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed out a generally good cooperation between coaches and referees. "Overall, the relationship is fitting. There are reactions, followed by consistent counter-reactions. The person affected must then live with it. That shouldn't be anything earth-shattering," Fröhlich told the German Press Agency.
"Conflicts can certainly arise from emotions during the course of the game. But when emotions spill over into personal insults, one must also accept that the corresponding measures will be taken by the referee," said Fröhlich. In the recent cases, the parties involved have resolved the issues afterwards. "It would be important, however, if a process of rethinking as a whole were to be initiated, so that such behavior is simply not acceptable," Fröhlich said on the sidelines of an event organized by the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed out possible effects on another level. "Of course, incidents in professional football always have an impact. There is a role model effect, which results in imitation. In the recent cases in the Bundesliga, the referees have consistently reacted to negative behavior," said Fröhlich. "Regardless of the consistent interpretation of the rules in the game, a clarifying conversation, with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those involved, is always helpful."
Combined skier Oftebro wins in Schonach
The victory was secured by the Norwegian Jens Luraas Oftebro after a jump from the normal hill and the ten-kilometer cross-country skiing race, ahead of the Austrian overall leader Johannes Lamparter. Third place went to Kristjan Ilves from Estonia.
The German combined skiers are not competing in the Black Forest with their best lineup. Olympic champion Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel, and Johannes Rydzek are not present. They are preparing for the World Championships with training in Oberstdorf, which will take place from February 21st to March 5th in Planica, Slovenia. "We have three world-class athletes at home. The team naturally feels that," said national coach Hermann Weinbuch on ZDF.
Seven slightly injured after rear-end collision on A5
Seven people were slightly injured in an accident involving four vehicles on the A5 motorway near Hemsbach (Rhein-Neckar-Kreis), including two children. According to a police statement, the rear-end collision occurred on Saturday when a driver hit a car from behind during a slight traffic jam, pushing it into two other cars. The full closure of the lanes towards Heidelberg was lifted after about an hour and a half.
Finissage at the Marler Sculpture Museum
The exhibition was initiated by: the initiators Sebastian Freytag (left) and Georg Elben (right) stand with artist Christian Freudenberger in front of his mural.
On Sunday, February 12th, an unusual exhibition will come to an end at the Marler Skulpturenmuseum. There will be some extras for the finale.
The finissage for the exhibition "Wallbound" will take place on Sunday, February 12th, at 3 pm in the temporary location of the Marler Sculpture Museum at Georg-Herwegh-Straße 63-67. In three exhibition rooms, two large-scale wall paintings each attract attention.
After the exhibition, the walls will be painted over, the artworks will disappear. However, a catalog documents the works specifically created for the Marler Museum. It will be presented on February 12th by the two curators, Georg Elben and Sebastian Freytag.
At the finissage, Dr. Friederike Schuler will also give a lecture on wall-bound art in the service of the community. Using numerous examples, she will present the peculiarities of mural painting from the Weimar Republic and explore the connections to this art genre in the Federal Republic of Germany, with a focus on North Rhine-Westphalia from the 1950s to the 1970s.
Dr. Friederike Schuler is a freelance art historian and curator who obtained her doctorate in 2013 on the subject of mural painting during the Weimar Republic. Since then, she has been researching architectural art as well as the art and institutional history of post-war Germany, most recently together with Sebastian Freytag on art in public buildings in North Rhine-Westphalia. After the lecture, the final curator-guided tour of the exhibition will take place. The artists will be present.
Arrest warrants issued after building collapses in Turkey
It is about construction defects that have contributed to the collapse of buildings: In the Turkish earthquake region, the judicial authorities have issued arrest warrants against dozens of suspects.
Istanbul. In the south of Turkey, dozens of arrest warrants have been issued for possible construction defects following building collapses during the earthquake. In the city of Diyarbakir, arrest warrants have been issued against 33 people, reported the state news agency Anadolu on Saturday, citing prosecutors. The accused are said to be responsible for construction defects that contributed to the collapse of the buildings.
According to Anadolu, the public prosecutor's office in Adana is also investigating possible construction defects in collapsed buildings. As part of these investigations, 62 arrest warrants have been issued so far, it was said. According to the information, one of the suspects was apprehended at Istanbul airport. He is said to have attempted to travel to Montenegro with cash and is now in pretrial detention, Anadolu reported. Nine other individuals were reportedly arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.
Early Monday morning, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.7 shook the Turkish-Syrian border area, followed by another earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 at noon. More than 7,500 buildings collapsed, solely in Turkey.
Former Prime Minister of the GDR Hans Modrow has died.
Hans Modrow is dead, as announced by the Left Party faction in the Bundestag. The 95-year-old passed away during the night on Saturday. Faction leader Dietmar Bartsch praised the former SED official and later PDS and Left Party politician as a "deeply sincere socialist."
Last night, "Hans Modrow passed away at the age of 95," the Left Party faction in the Bundestag announced on Saturday. The party is losing "an important figure," stated the faction leader Dietmar Bartsch and former faction leader Gregor Gysi.
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the 1st Secretary of the District Leadership of the SED in Dresden. As Prime Minister, he accompanied the end of the GDR. Just four days after the fall of the Berlin Wall, on November 13, 1989, he became Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR - for about 150 days. In the People's Chamber elections on March 18, 1990, the SED/PDS lost power and Modrow lost his position one month later. He was followed by CDU politician Lothar de Maizière as the last Prime Minister of the GDR until reunification.
The faction leader of the Left Party, Dietmar Bartsch, described Modrow in a message on the short message service Twitter as a "deeply sincere and combative socialist". Bartsch added:
"Until old age, he was an important advisor in our party, whose wisdom will be missed."
"The entire peaceful process of the reunification of Germany was indeed a special achievement of his. That will remain his political legacy," wrote Bartsch and Gysi in their obituary. It further states:
"His later work in the People's Chamber, the Bundestag, the European Parliament, and as honorary chairman of the PDS always consisted of representing that part of the former GDR population who were not wanted and whose interests were regularly violated."
After reunification, Modrow served in the German Bundestag from 1990 to 1994 for the PDS and represented them in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
According to a report by the German Press Agency (dpa), Modrow saw the new state "quite critically". The German reunification had happened too quickly, the GDR had collapsed too unconditionally, and it had been condemned too one-sidedly as an "unjust state", Modrow criticized in many interviews, according to dpa.
What happened during the night
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky condemns Russian missile attacks. Meanwhile, Kiev has to carry out emergency repairs to the power grid.
Kiev - The recent wave of Russian missile attacks is once again forcing emergency repairs to be made to the Ukrainian energy grid. However, Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions. Several thermal and hydroelectric power plants have been damaged, said the head of the energy provider Ukrenergo, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, on Friday evening on Ukrainian television. The power supply in the Kharkiv region looks particularly bad. Due to the instability in the Ukrainian power grid, a reactor block had to be shut down at the Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plant, and production was reduced at the Rivne and South Ukraine nuclear power plants.
President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the Russian attack with approximately 100 rockets and cruise missiles on Friday as terrorism. In a video message, however, he informed his fellow countrymen about the amount of support Ukraine had received during his trip to London, Paris, and Brussels this week.
Selenskyj will not abandon the small town of Bachmut.
On February 24th, there will have been a war for one year. US President Joe Biden announced a visit to important Ukraine supporter Poland shortly before the anniversary. The danger of Russian missile attacks continued into Saturday night. In the capital city of Kiev, air raid sirens were sounded for the fifth time on Friday evening. "There is a threat of a drone attack," the military administration of the Kiev region announced. Iranian-style combat drones were also sighted and shot down over the areas of Mykolajiw and Odessa in the south.
German Railways: Federal Government selects consultants for network company
Demands, including those from the FDP and the Greens during the election campaign, to separate them, failed due to the coalition partner SPD. In the coalition agreement, they agreed on the compromise of an infrastructure company, which, however, should be oriented towards the common good in the future. This means that it does not need to generate profits and pay them out.
Backlog of renovations amounting to 80 billion euros.
The two consulting firms are supposed to help the federal government accompany this process. The backlog of repairs in the rail network is a significant reason why the train is currently running very unpunctually. Minister of Transport Wissing has made it his task to eliminate this problem by completely renovating entire railway corridors. The investments necessary for this have so far been estimated at 50 billion euros. According to newer calculations by the railway, however, they are more likely to be up to 80 billion euros.
Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof 2023 - Gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: "Can someone please pinch me?"
The external circumstances did not seem to speak in favor of Herrmann-Wick. She had slept poorly, she said after the race, she had been "totally excited", her heart rate had not come down even during warm-up. "Such a race", and that at the home World Championships, "cannot be described in words", she said. 11,000 spectators cheered to booming Schlager music with German flags, coaches and team members embraced each other.
"Enjoying biathlon," that was what she had planned.
For Herrmann-Wick, the pressure had been particularly high. The 34-year-old had started the World Championships as the biggest, if not the only, German medal hope outside of the relays. Herrmann-Wick has won two World Cups this winter, the only German to do so. She is currently in fifth place in the overall World Cup standings. And even though the level of competition among women at the top is significantly higher than among men, where only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians currently dominate, one would have expected others to win this sprint.
Criticism of the government - Bishop in Nicaragua sentenced to 26 years in prison
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-leaning head of state. He accuses Ortega of suppressing religious freedom. The relationship between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church has been highly strained since 2018. At that time, protesters who demanded Ortega's resignation had sought refuge in churches. More than 350 people were killed during the protests in 2018. In the following years, thousands of people left the Central American country, often out of fear of repression or arrest. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of conspiring with the US government to overthrow him.
German: The defense industry demands more orders from special assets from the Bundeswehr.
First armament projects have already been cancelled, as the "Welt am Sonntag" reports. Further projects are also at risk of being cancelled. However, it is currently not possible to say which specific investments would be eliminated. "There is no need to assign specific procurement measures to potential savings requirements at this time," the German government stated in response to a query from Bundestag member Ingo Gädechens (CDU).
The background for the decreasing investment amount is the rising interest rates. The fully credit-financed special fund, which the Bundestag decided on in June 2022, must bear the interest costs for the loans itself. If these rise, less money is available for the specific acquisitions for the Bundeswehr. In addition, the purchasing power of the remaining amount is decreasing due to the currently high inflation.
Kupferzell: Accident with 3 injured
On the night from Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.), around 01.40 am, a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from the direction of Kupferzell, wanted to turn left onto the highway at the Kupferzell entrance towards Heilbronn. At this time, a 21-year-old VW driver was traveling on B 19 towards Künzelsau, as reported by the police. During the turning maneuver of the BMW driver, there was a collision between the two vehicles.
Both parties involved in the accident stated that the traffic lights installed at the accident site showed "green" for them. An inspection of the traffic lights revealed no issues. Further investigations will follow. In the accident, the 24-year-old, the 21-year-old, and the passenger in the BMW were all slightly injured. They had to be taken to a hospital. The two cars suffered a total property damage of approximately 20,000 euros.
Castle Square Stuttgart commemorates the victims of the earthquake catastrophe.
Many Stuttgart residents followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib Mosque community on Friday evening.
Tens of thousands of people have died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria. The sympathy is great - also in Stuttgart.
Earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria concerns the world. On Friday evening, more than 200 people gathered at Stuttgart's Schlossplatz to remember the victims and pray for them.
Many community members followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib Mosque community, young and old, women and men. They all listened attentively and silently to the Imam's prayer. In the prayer, the Imam asked Allah for help for the people in the affected areas, so that they could also overcome this catastrophe. He asked, among other things, for health, protection from plagues, and respectful interaction with one another. The community also requested support and strength to "bring our help to the areas affected by the earthquake".
Ditib stands by the people in Turkey and Syria. The speakers expressed their sympathy for the victims and the relatives of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the memorial event. The prayers were also translated into German on the Schlossplatz.
The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border region is great. Several million euros have already been collected in the donation campaign of the German Islamic Association Turkish-Islamic Union (Ditib).
The Alevite community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt has collected material donations on Glockenstraße for several days, which are to be transported to the earthquake-stricken areas by truck. The willingness to help there was also overwhelming.
Hiking with a meat dish - Ebersberg
"After eating, you should rest or take a thousand steps"... The older generation knows the proverb, while the younger generation simply puts it into practice. Either way, during the years of the pandemic, the good old digestion walk has experienced an unexpected renaissance. Because thanks to working from home, instead of sitting in the middle of a concrete jungle, many people are just a stone's throw away from fields, forests, and meadows. Now they use their lunch break either after a quick snack in front of the screen or as a substitute for a walk in the fresh air. At least that's the impression one could get around the Egglburger Lake, where between 12 and 2 pm, not only dog owners gather.
One reason could of course also be that in the course of optimal time slot utilization, modern humans can combine health-promoting fresh air supply with other things. Because why not learn news from the settlement on the occasion of a short walk through nature with the long-unseen neighbor? Or meet the friend with whom you never make it to the cinema in the evening, not even to the old cinema? This way, work and private life could also be combined - who says that the appointment with the tax consultant, lawyer, or investment advisor cannot take place outdoors? As long as there are no eavesdroppers nearby, of course.
What one can also do excellently is the acquisition of natural products. Fresh fruit, for example, which is placed along with little baskets on a table by the roadside. Or potatoes and meat. It's just unfortunate if one hasn't thought about the purchase in advance and made the necessary preparations. Thus, an older couple in Hinteregglburg leaves the wooden sales room of the farmer with empty hands and regret in their voices. "Too bad, we unfortunately forgot the money."
The disappointment can be understood, as one does have a companion with a wallet, but not a transport container. This is also made known to the friendly chance acquaintance. To which the man replies, "That's not true! You do have a bag with you!" He points to the hood of the jacket that one quickly put on before leaving the house, even though the sunshine makes an additional head covering unnecessary. "My wife always puts everything in there!"
And so it happens that one embarks on the return journey with a meat filling and during this short midday excursion, one not only becomes richer by a lamb's back, but also by a particularly practical idea. It is quite possible that on this day a second walk will be necessary - after dinner. This time, indeed, for digestion.
Trapped and seriously injured
Around 9 pm, the 25-year-old drove his Audi on the county road towards Hailfingen and, for reasons yet unknown, veered off the road to the right in a left curve, according to the police report. The Audi damaged a roadside post, collided sideways with a tree, and came to a stop a few meters away. The driver was trapped in his car due to the collision. The fire department freed him using heavy equipment. The emergency services transported the seriously injured person to a hospital. As there was suspicion of impaired driving, a blood sample was ordered. According to the police report, the Audi suffered a total loss amounting to 1000 euros.
Donald Trump's tax records: Point for the rule of law
The US Department of Justice has decided: The tax authorities must hand over the tax returns of the former president to the parliament.
Trump 2018, still in office as President of the United States
The Ministry of Finance must instruct the tax authority IRS to release the confidential documents to the Finance and Tax Committee, according to the decision of the ministry on Friday.
Contrary to political customs in the USA, real estate entrepreneur Trump did not publicly disclose his tax returns as a candidate or later as president. He fought all the way to the Supreme Court to prevent their release. A prosecutor's office in New York has since obtained the documents, but no details were allowed to be made public unless there is a trial.
The release to Congress is probably more delicate for Trump: there, the circle of authorized persons is slightly larger and under certain conditions, individual details could be published during the committee's investigation. In addition, confidential information also repeatedly leaks from the parliament.
The Chairwoman of the House of Representatives, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, immediately welcomed the decision as a "victory for the rule of law". Access to the Republican's tax records is a matter of national security, she wrote on Twitter. "The American people deserve to know the facts about his conflicts of interest and his undermining of our security as President," Pelosi explained.
Cabaret in the bastion: Life plays between birth and death
Kirchheim. Pasta or pizza? Samsung or Apple? Which mobile phone contract among the many offers? Stay or break up? Either - or? As slaves of time, people today rush from appointment to appointment and sometimes simply squeeze in people and hamburgers. Lucy van Kuhl shows in her new program that the "in-between" state has something exciting about it.
In a humorous and thoughtful way, Lucy van Kuhl tells and sings about situations from life. In her sensitive chansons and sharp and pointed cabaret songs, she gets straight to the point - and there is also something between the lines. It all starts on Saturday, February 18th, at 8:30 pm at the Kirchheimer Club Bastion.
British serial criminal captured in Thailand after long escape
London - After five years on the run, a convicted drug offender from Great Britain has been captured in Thailand. As the British National Crime Agency (NCA) announced on Saturday, the man was arrested on Friday by Thai police officers in a car workshop in Bangkok. The 55-year-old was on the "Most Wanted" list of the NCA's most sought-after criminals.
According to authorities, the leader of a criminal group had fled before the start of a court trial in early 2018, in which he had been sentenced to eleven years in prison in absentia for attempted importation of amphetamines worth eight million pounds (nine million euros).

Cabaret - Stories from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: The trained physicist from Unterfranken, who has been living in Vienna for three years and according to his own statement loves Viennese humor, advocates for science in his cabaret programs. The programmatic title of his current solo "Make Science Great Again" fits well with this. Whether this fits well with the generally prevailing skepticism towards science in Austria is debatable. However, his humor fits very well in Vienna.
By the way, the English title is also derived from Ebert's recent life story, as he tried to establish himself as a stand-up comedian in New York for a year in 2019. But now he's back and not only tells his German-speaking audience about his experiences overseas, but also explains what science actually is and what it can do - and what it can't do. Of course, Corona is also mentioned, but also German thoroughness in the bathroom and American engineering.
And he breaks it down to the most important question that many put off: What is really important? All of this with a huge wink, calmly and very ironically. And so, not only are we well entertained, but we can also learn something along the way.

1. General
The one-man entertainment device BATTLEZONE is equipped with a vector or X/Y monitor. This game illustrates the combat situation from the perspective of a tank driver. The battles take place in a wide valley, completely surrounded by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley floor, there are rock pyramids and boulders that provide the player with temporary protection, as they cannot be destroyed by enemy shots.
The opponent is represented by slow-moving tracked vehicles and fast super tanks, as well as agile missiles that become increasingly difficult to hit during the extended gameplay. Additionally, UFOs appear at periodic intervals. These cannot attack the player's tank, but the player can achieve a high score by hitting a UFO. The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) different operating modes. These are the attraction mode, the game introduction mode, the game mode, the initial input for high scores, and the self-test mode. The latter mode is a special sequence for checking the controls and computer function.
4. Game process
The game sequence is triggered when the START button is pressed. The LED switch remains illuminated and the game sounds become audible. When the last player tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game is finished. The game starts with slowly moving tanks that become visible on the screen. The player can determine the position of the respective enemy tanks or rockets by paying attention to the displayed text in the upper left corner of the cockpit's hint display angle. A hint could be, for example: ENEMY FROM THE RIGHT. Additionally, on the long-range radar screen, accompanied by a sonar BLIP sound, a dot becomes visible representing the enemy position.
The upper, cone-shaped area on the radar screen represents the player's field of view on the underlying screen. If the opponent is in this area, they can be targeted well on the screen. Furthermore, ENEMY IN FIRING RANGE is simultaneously displayed in the upper left notification display.
Temporary UFOs become visible on the screen, flying over the battlefield. These are harmless flying objects that observe the combat situation and cannot eliminate either the opponent or the player's tank. The flight position of the UFOs cannot be detected by radar. The UFOs are intended to complement the combat situation and distract the player, as they usually appear simultaneously with enemy tanks or rockets. UFOs can be eliminated by both the player's tank and the opponent's tank. A shot by the player earns them 5,000 points. If an opponent is hit, the following points are achieved: 1,000 points for a slow-moving tank, 2,000 points for a rocket, and 3,000 points for a super tank. A super tank moves and turns twice as fast as the player's tank or an opponent's slow-moving tank. Several options give the operator the opportunity to use 2, 3, 4, or even 5 tanks for gameplay. Furthermore, after reaching predetermined scores, a bonus tank can be unlocked and the appearance of the rocket can be varied for a more challenging gameplay. Details and the exact switch positions of the gameplay selector for this setting can be found in the illustration.
5. Initial input for highest results
If a player exceeds the minimum score in the table of high scores, he or she can enter three (3) personal initials into the table after the game ends. The instructions for this are self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. It should be noted that triggering a self-test, pressing the RESET button on the Battlezone Analog Vector-Generator PCB, or interrupting the power supply will delete the table of high scores. When deleted (RESET), the ten (10) highest scores with their initials are saved and written back on the screen to challenge other players. Any score over 100,000 is additionally marked with a tank symbol, followed by the player's initials. If a player does not enter their initials within 60 seconds, the computer will automatically enter dashes. After that, the device switches back to the attraction game sequence. ASSEMBLY ARRANGEMENT.
1. New parts
The device BATTLEZONE has five (5) new components. If you already have experience with ATARI video devices, you should take note of these important differences. The new parts are: A. The control lever. This is a reconstruction of the ATARI gear lever. It has been reinforced with several additional ribs on the inner and outer housing parts, making this unit more stable and ensuring proper functioning of the switch contacts. Another modification is the rubber centering bellows, which, like a centering spring, always brings the control lever back to the center position. The micro switches are now attached with self-locking nuts for easier replacement. B. Two PC boards. ATARI's X/Y game circuit has been expanded onto two (2) interconnected boards. These are the Analog Vector Generator and the auxiliary board. With the help of this circuitry, more lines are generated on the screen at a higher speed, resulting in a smooth and steady image. C. The power supply. Battlezone is equipped with a newly designed power supply. It has a larger, more powerful transformer to cover the increased power supply required by the expanded circuitry. D. The device housing. Due to the new design, it was now possible to install a new cash box with a larger coin capacity. Furthermore, the device contains a console intended as a platform for smaller players to facilitate gameplay. At the same time, this console ensures maximum stability of the device at the installation site.
These new components, as well as all other main assemblies of this device, are shown in Figure 1. If one of these new parts is mentioned in the manual, you will find this symbol. 2. Device inspection.
After removing the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready to play. Nevertheless, you should perform a certain inspection to complete the quality control. In order to have the certainty that the device was delivered to you in proper condition, the following checks should be carried out: NOTE: Do not connect the device to the 220 V power supply yet. A. Inspect the exterior of the housing for any damages. B. Open the maintenance flap of the device and check the components inside the device as follows: (1) Check all cable harness connectors for correct and secure connection. Connect any open or loose connectors together.
Note: Never force plug connections. The plugs are equipped with a guide so that a correct connection is made. A plug connection twisted by 180 degrees destroys the PCB.
(2) Check the plug connections to the game PC board for correct and secure fit. (3) Pay attention to the device's production number on the nameplate on the back of the device. Check if the stamped production number matches those of the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PC board, auxiliary PC board, controller/audio II PC board, and the TV monitor. An illustration of the location of the production number can be found on the back cover of this manual. This number should always be provided when calling your dealer for further service information. (4) Check all other main components such as the power supply, control console, and TV monitor for proper installation. (5) Finally, the device must be supplied with mains voltage and turned on. With a look through the player's viewing glass, check if the radar screen is also located in the bright, orange-circled opening of the enclosure. If the opening is not centered exactly, the enclosure, which is attached to the housing with adhesive tape, must be loosened and realigned. Before connecting the device to the mains power supply, make sure that the voltage selector plug on the power supply 1 (see Fig. 3) matches the local mains voltage. Check the cable color on the plug and verify the connection values as listed below:
DO YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SOFTWARE? Below you will find a series of tips that can help you solve most issues related to current DirectX games. Checking the system configuration.

INTRODUCTORY WORDS ABOUT FAHRENHEIT
The desire to develop video games was ignited in me by the emergence of 3D real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a lot of new possibilities and appeared to me as a new means of expression through which one could push the boundaries of the world. It represented a way for me to explore new horizons. I felt like a cinematic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century: on the one hand, I struggled with the still immature technology, but on the other hand, I was aware that there was still everything to discover - especially a new language that had to be both narrative and visual. To be completely honest, the next ten years couldn't satisfy my hunger. I had the dull feeling that video games only exploited a tiny part of their amazing creative possibilities because they were too focused on "action" and forgot a fundamental element of the human experience: emotions. Meanwhile, technology continued to make rapid progress. Fahrenheit represents my contribution to making video games a true means of conveying emotions. Although this could have happened in a completely different form, Fahrenheit's greatest merit is the fact that real questions are raised here and concrete answers are offered. Fahrenheit is proof that it is indeed possible to create an interactive gaming experience that is not only based on fighting hideous monsters in dark corridors and shooting crates to get ammunition, but also has much more demanding and profound content. It is proof that you can tell a story and offer gameplay without having to sacrifice the narrative or interactive elements. I hope that both hardcore gamers and casual players will enjoy this new gaming experience. If you are rather skeptical about video games, I hope that Fahrenheit will contribute to changing your attitude towards them. May other developers also feel the desire to embark on this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspirations, talent, and ambition. Interactivity is still in its infancy and offers the chance to discover everything. In the past two years, Fahrenheit has filled a large part of our lives and has been an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, in which we were constantly forced to question many of the principles that were previously considered unshakable. I would consider myself fortunate if Fahrenheit - like books, movies, and songs that have left a lasting impression on you - also doesn't pass you by completely unnoticed. David Cage

Gameplay
By pressing the corresponding start button, the game is started for one or (with a minimum credit of 2) for 2 players. The goal is to try to occupy as much area as possible without crossing the path of the rotating QIX and without hitting the wandering SPARX. The game is set up so that a minimum required area must be occupied before the next area (round) can be tackled. The timed SPARX are displayed at the top of the screen with red timing lines. When the red lines intersect, additional SPARX are released. When an alarm sounds, the SPARX become SUPER-SPARX and more aggressive. If, while trying to draw your area, your marker enters the death spiral, it will be destroyed because you cannot cross your own path or go back. If you hesitate and do not complete your area, a fuse will be lit and your marker will be destroyed. Two speed settings are available. With slower drawing speed, the points are doubled. After opening the control panel, the 4 programming and testing switches are accessible.
The QIX game is able to test itself, it provides data and demonstrates that circuits and controls are functioning properly. For more information, see "Service Program". The volume can be adjusted using the volume control (VOLUME) on the Data/Sound PC board.

SERVICE PROGRAM
General. For programming and testing, the 4 switches located in the device, the self-test button, and the LEDs on the video PC board are used.
Programming display. With this display, the language (English, French, Spanish, German) for address programming and game operation is selected. The languages can be set using the "Sub-Test" switch. When the desired language - green - appears, press the "Test" switch to switch to the next program display. Deployment programming. With this display, the difficulty factor for the game can be determined. Additionally, a "maximum number of credits" that can be set before the game starts can be adjusted. The desired value for the text to be changed is set by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch (appears green), and the desired value for this line is programmed using the "Up" or "Down" switch. By pressing the "Sub-Test" switch multiple times, the factory or default setting can be reached when the bottom line (RESET line) lights up green, press the "Up" switch. The values are reset, and the pointer (the lines that appear green) jumps to the first line, further programming can be done. "Test" always triggers the next program display. "Back" [Reserve High Score Value x 10,000] is used to transfer the high score points to the next program display until "High hit rate so far". This value determines the required score/hit count for a player to have their own initials (names) and hit points entered on the screen. The "maximum number of credits" determines a coin acceptance limit for the device. If the limit is exceeded and a coin lock is present, the coin acceptance is locked. This allows a limited number of games to be set for a player. This value ranges from 1 to 99. It should not be set too close to 99 so that credits cannot be reduced to zero by inserting a coin if it exceeds 99. A free play mode can be selected by setting "maximum number of credits" to 0. Additional programming: "Number of games": Number of marking characters per credit.
"Threshold": the level of the percentage that must be reached in order to switch to the next round.
"Time limit": Approval for additional sparks
"Difficulty": Difficulty level of the gameplay.
"Anziehton": no sound at idle when set to "0"
at "1" sound even in standby mode (animated sound) "table model": at "0" free-standing device
at "1" tabletop device
The credits per coin are set on the "coin slot programming" display. High score program display (highest score so far). The player's score points and initials, including the next 10 highest scores, are displayed. The values are used to set the high score, which is selected on the previous display (set to "back"). By pressing the "Up" switch, the initials QIX Standard are set. Pressing the "Test" switch displays the next program display. The "overall evaluation". By pressing the "Up" switch, it can be set to 0. The following values are recorded: Total credits: The number of paid credits. The total number is not set to 0. When 1,000,000 is reached, the count starts over. The total number can only appear as 0 if the battery or connector W1 is removed with the device turned off. Left side coins: Number of coins inserted in the left coin slot. Middle coins: (not available) Right side coins: Number of coins inserted in the right coin slot. Paid credits: Number of credits given for inserted (converted) coins. Granted credits: Number of credits given by the device. % Free games: Granted credits (Paid + granted credits per 100). Played minutes: Number of minutes played. Won minutes: Number of minutes in extended or won game. % Leisure time: Won minutes/played minutes per 100. Average game duration in seconds: Played minutes/paid + granted credits.
High Score (Hit Rate): Number of times a player had a high enough hit rate to surpass other players on the high score list. Pressing the "Up" button resets the values to 0. Pressing the "Test" button displays the next program display.
Coin slot programming/normal money setting. With the help of this display, the operator can choose a standard coin setting or program a different setting.
If a default setting is provided, pressing the "Up" and "Down" buttons selects the programming while the top digit lights up green on the screen. The size values change with the change of the digit. When the correct setting is reached by pressing the "Test" button, the setting is adopted. If a setting is desired that does not correspond to the default setting, the values can be set by pressing the "Sub-Test" button. After pressing once, the upper setting number is set to 0, which means that custom setting is possible. Since the lower values remain unchanged, the programmer can reduce their setting efforts by choosing a setting that is close to their desired values and only changing the values that are not suitable. Once the setting is made, any newly adjustable size can be selected by pressing the "Sub-Test" button. If pressed unintentionally, the default setting appears. The "Up" and "Down" buttons can be used to increase or decrease the values. The process is completed by pressing the "Test" button. The coin multiplier ("coin unit") indicates how many coin units are given for each coin inserted through an associated slot. Coin units - "credit" shows the number of units required before a credit is issued. "Bonus" coin units show the required units before a bonus credit is issued. "Min. coin" is a value that accumulates credits until a specified minimum amount of coins is reached. This value is not used in the default setting "0". CMOS MEMORY (memory) FAILURE.
When "Memory Failure - Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, where all programming is stored, has failed. All values stored in the RAM will be reset to factory default settings. This condition likely indicates battery failure or error.
TROUBLESHOOTING and SETTINGS
Start of the testing method. Press the "Sub-Test" switch or the "Self-Test" button (SW 1 near the LED display). All LEDs should light up and the hardware test can begin. The tests and settings can be entered for each program display, and pressing the "Test" switch will display the next program. If a continuous test of the video board is desired, the Self-Test button must be pressed twice to start the video test in auto-test mode. In this program, the device will continuously perform the hardware test until it is turned off. If the display shows "Open Coin Door to Test," the program plug J 19, 1 - 2 must be inserted. With the J 19 plug removed, the memory will be protected and the CMOS RAM test video cannot be performed. Hardware tests: These tests are performed as follows: O = off / I = on / X = test results.
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each video ROM and compares it with the checksum stored for this ROM. If a difference is found, the device stops and the value of the ROM with the incorrect checksum appears on the LEDs. If the checksum ROM is faulty, U 10 is displayed first. If this test fails, the next ROM displayed on the LED display must be replaced. The E-PROM memory in a given game can be introduced as a series of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROMs. The E-PROM type for each series is selected by the decoding connector (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732). Communications RAM from the video board.
The Communications RAM test determines the functional reliability of the memory shared by two processors by storing predetermined series of numbers in the RAM and then checking if the storage was correct. LED value: 00 0010 If the device holds with the above-mentioned display, an error has been detected. If the Communications RAM fails during the Video Board test, the error may have been caused by a defective wiring (RAM) or errors in the Data Board. To locate the error, remove the Data Board from P 6 and repeat the test. A failure means: error in U 3, U 4 or associated circuits.
Video board CMOS RAM
After values have been written into another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is checked in the same way as the Communications RAM. If the test is passed, all memory locations are set to their previous value. LED value: 00 0011 If the device stops at the above-mentioned display, an error is present. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the associated circuits or decoding.
Check the video board color RAM by storing predetermined number sequences in the color RAM. These number sequences are checked for accuracy when read back. LED value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, an error is present. Check U 56, U 57, associated multiplexers, and decoders.
Video board (display RAM). The display RAM is tested by writing a pattern on each page. The results of these writings are compared with the original pattern. Any discrepancy causes the program to stop and the LEDs indicate the faulty RAM. If a display RAM fails, identify the problem and replace the RAM. If this error diagnosis does not indicate a RAM failure (00 0101 on LEDs), it is indicated that the next test is starting (Data Hardware). The connection to the Data Processor must be present and it must be functional.
Unfortunately disappointed
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. That is also the reason for star number 1. The second reason is that the correct jacket arrived without any visible seam flaws. BUT I was probably too excited about this jacket, because the disappointment was even greater. I had based my decision on the other reviews and ordered the jacket in size L. Since it is supposed to fit so tightly and I didn't want to struggle with an S or M size due to my bust size... In the end, it would have fit in terms of length and at the hips... but I could swim in the rest. Additionally, the lining material came out of the package when I opened it and spread everywhere. Just a shame... It will be returned :/
Fast delivery and good craftsmanship
The jacket makes a great impression. We were surprised by the good craftsmanship. It can be worn well on both sides. We ordered it for our daughter and she is totally thrilled. She usually wears size 158 and the size 36 fits her quite well in this case and will surely be worn for the next year as well. We can recommend placing an order.
Robust quality
I chose the rubber pad C because I always work with wood on the jack and it is not optimal. Unfortunately, I measured wrong and the pad doesn't fit perfectly. But that's my mistake. I then made a slight adjustment to make it fit. The pad seems very robust and no longer damages the edges. You can use the groove or the entire surface. It worked without any problems. It doesn't slip anymore. I would buy it again immediately.
Unfortunately too big for under 1 year.
The product itself is okay, but not for children under one year. The surface to chew on is too big for their small mouth. We got it when our son was 7 months old and he couldn't use it because of its size. Now, at 12 months, we took it out again and he can use it. He hasn't been able to bite anything with his few existing teeth yet. And when it was in the fridge, it calmed him down.
Quality not sufficient / Unfortunately, it is going back
I have probably been blinded here by the partly exuberant reviews. I would like to preface this by saying that I already have 2 backpacks from Lowepro in use. One very large one (for storing equipment) and a rather small one for the most important everyday things that you just take with you. Because I just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the small Lowepro has now become too small and I need a replacement. On Prime Day, I purchased this backpack for a really affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy with this purchase, as I had read many of the reviews beforehand. When the backpack arrived yesterday, the disillusionment followed: The backpack is not bad for under 30 EUR, you can't say that. But that it can keep up with the well-known products that are sold at much higher prices, as written in many reviews... guys, that's simply not true! I really hoped it would be, but there's really no question about it. The padded walls are much thinner and do not offer the same level of protection as my Lowepro. Oh, and the dividers inside are of a different caliber, much flimsier. Overall, the feel of this backpack cannot be compared to my Lowepro. Even the zippers and the materials of the compartments for small items are not particularly high quality. Therefore, I have decided to return the backpack. If I invest in equipment worth thousands of euros, unfortunately, I also have to spend money on a decent backpack. Quality apparently has its price here. For someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money, the backpack is certainly a good choice, but not for me. And it's not like the decision was difficult for me. When I unpacked the backpack, I knew after 2 minutes that it would be returned. What I liked is the color inside. Here, you will definitely find your things much faster than with a gray interior. For someone who has different expectations for a backpack, the backpack is certainly a great thing, but mine is going back.
Unfortunately disappointed by the third part
So far, I had liked the Electric series by E. L. Todd the best, but my opinion was revised with this book. I found the first two books very strong and also recommendable, and I was really looking forward to the third part. In this part, it's all about the feelings of Volt and Taylor, and I found it unnecessarily dragged out. Taylor has been infatuated with Volt for so long, finally admits everything to himself, and then acts like a little child and withdraws during every argument?! At the same time, there were also inconsistencies, in my opinion, because at the end of the second part, Volt tried to convince Taylor's ex and didn't believe him when he said Taylor had feelings for him, and tried to convince the ex that Taylor couldn't live without him and that he had heard it himself. But at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and fights for Taylor. I had hoped that this would be the last part of the series and I think that this part is the weakest and also quite unnecessary. Nevertheless, I will still read the fourth part and hope that it finally comes out that Taylor's girlfriend Sarah is Volt's ex. That would bring more tension back into the story.
Human destroys everything, does not appreciate anything and does not learn! First of all: The movie is not as bad as many people write. Of course, the story is completely constructed and always conceived according to the same formula. If you have seen the beginning, you know how it ends. And the message is always the same: Human destroys everything, does not appreciate anything, and does not learn! And that is exactly what the movie wants to tell us! How often have I thought while watching the movie (even though I know it's just a movie and the animals are computer-generated): Oh my God, the poor animals, it often brings tears to my eyes. Therefore, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is really well made. It's just a shame that humans simply don't get the message behind the movie, even though it's a mainstream film. We consistently destroy the animals and the environment, and ultimately our planet and ourselves. Out of greed and profit, and out of stupidity and arrogance! Empathy for the environment and living beings: nonexistent. 4 stars because the movie is well made, but unfortunately always follows the same principle, otherwise it could have been 5 stars. Still, well-made popcorn cinema.
a quiet, sensitive film
Some expect a film like 8 Mile here. This film is not a Hollywood blockbuster and does not want to be one either. This film is above all "French" - it is also calm, sensitive, empathetic, authentic, and makes one cry - if one engages with it and does not expect anything from it that it does not want to be.
Problematic
Taste like Quench from the 90s, supposedly orange, but that doesn't matter. 5 days, every morning a packet: nothing has changed, absolutely nothing. My waistline has grown by 12 cm! More bloating than ever before! After that, diarrhea 5-8 times a day. Not very helpful, unfortunately, even though I stopped immediately, the diarrhea has been going on for 1 week. It should be noted that the smaller packaging size only received 2 stars (unfortunately seen too late), while the larger one received a full 5 stars? That is very, very strange!
Terrible smell and poor results! I dyed my blonde hair a chocolate brown with an intensive tint in October, and in February/March, I used this hair color remover. I applied the product twice. The first time, I immediately noticed that it smelled terrible! However, the result was not too bad, it turned out to be a chestnut brown (slightly darker). Since I didn't achieve my desired result, I used it again as instructed, even though I was not satisfied with the outcome. This time, it was just a waste of time! It made no difference, my hair looked the same as after the first attempt. The worst part was that it continued to smell for weeks after the application. No matter how many times I washed my hair, the smell just wouldn't go away.
Highly recommended
I have been taking the tablets for a longer period of time now, one tablet every 5 days. My vitamin levels have been low for a while due to my work, lack of exercise, and another longer additional illness. I wanted to boost my immune system not only through healthy nutrition but also by taking vitamin D3 and K2. This works very well. I feel more energetic and much more comfortable. I sleep better and get out of bed easier. The price is also great considering how long you can take the tablets. Absolutely recommended.
Function not entirely flawless !!! After 3 months of using the battery case, I have discovered the following major defects which I find very annoying: 1) The case has problems connecting to the phone over time. This means that it no longer charges even though the "Power On/Off" button has been pressed for 3 seconds. Removing the phone from the case and reinstalling it solves the problem in 70% of cases, but this creates a new issue. 2) Due to frequent removal and reinstallation of the phone in the case, the cover has become so worn out that it detaches from the case on its own, which has almost caused me to lose it several times. These may not be many major defects, but I believe that a battery case should function flawlessly in its purpose, and therefore I am very disappointed with the product, especially considering that I have only been using it for 3 months and it cost me 30€.
Too expensive, too thin, and disappointing.
I don't know how all these good reviews come about. Ultimately, it is actually a glasses cleaning cloth that you can get as a gift in a slightly smaller size at any optician. The cleaning effect is as good as a kitchen towel and no better. I expected much more from these cloths, they are also really thin. Since I have used it, I can no longer exchange it. I am disappointed and cannot recommend it from my side. The price for these cloths is excessive, you should not pay more than 2 euros.
I doubt the frequency response.
I bought this speaker for the shower when my smaller free speaker, which I received as a promotional gift, unfortunately broke. In general, the Onforu works great, it is waterproof (I have already dropped it in the shower), it reproduces bass like bass, Bluetooth works great... Of course, you have to wet the suction cup, otherwise it will come off... it can play sound very loudly... yes... what I see as critical is the frequency response of this small speaker. As I said, bass is reproduced as bass and not converted into a higher frequency. However, this causes a problem. Some frequencies are played very loudly, while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of the vocals almost hurt the ears, higher and lower frequencies are just audible enough. Although my old speaker did not reproduce bass well as bass, the frequencies were represented quite naturally in terms of volume. Unfortunately, this is not really the case with the Onforu, which I find somewhat annoying. Therefore, I have to deduct one star for that. I expected more from the frequency response.
very bad
At a few places, the paint had chipped off and when you just touched it with your hand, the paint would come off in some places as well. We wanted to have it picked up for free because we didn't want it anymore, but unfortunately, only at our expense. They would only replace the damaged parts, but how, if both dressers were damaged. Poor service from the manufacturer. Amazon took care of everything for us and refunded our money. A praise to Amazon.
Better to spend a little more money
The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in the quality. Individual parts are delivered that you have to glue together yourself. The product was packaged in a simple envelope made of thin cardboard. There was no additional protection. Since the mailman stuffed the product into my mailbox, a few templates were damaged. I didn't complain about it because I urgently needed this product. The included adhesive hardly holds, but it sticks properly - like chewing gum that doesn't harden. Already one day after gluing, almost half of the templates had fallen off the wooden stick. Since the adhesive material does not dry out (at least it was still not dry 5 days after gluing), you have to be very careful not to glue everything together. The templates are partially incomplete. For one-time use and as a gag for a party, it's okay, but for a wedding, I would invest a bit more money and go for a high-quality product.
I am not dissatisfied. The wardrobe looks good and is easy to assemble, even though the instructions are not very clear. + Magnetic closures + nice appearance + stable when assembled + shelf can be positioned as desired.
- Doors slam due to magnets (can perhaps be compensated with rubber stoppers) - some unclean spots.
- The supplied dowels are much too small and wobbly (I didn't have any others and there was no hardware store nearby, so I glued them in place with craft glue) - The brackets for the shelf wobble a bit (I wrapped them with some paper to stabilize them) Conclusion: If it didn't look so good and have such good dimensions, I would give it fewer stars because you have to make everything fit to be truly satisfied. Also, I think it's a bit too expensive for that.
The coffee tastes good to me....but
...there are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion, the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive). Therefore, I would have given 5 stars. Unfortunately, the coffee does not flow evenly (if at all!). Additionally, the additional plastic waste (individually packaged, see photo) means a deduction of one star for me. I hope the manufacturer changes this and soon receives a full score.
Gets on my nerves
The alarm clock arrived quickly and everything is easy to set up. However, the natural sounds sound terrible and extremely loud. I couldn't even lower the volume. It's probably a defect, supposedly it's possible. Even the quietest radio setting was too loud for me, I immediately fall out of bed. In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can create shadows on the wall with your hand. I always woke up when I turned my face towards the alarm clock because I thought it was already morning. However, when the sunrise simulation started, it was immediately too bright for me. I liked the colors and the color change, but unfortunately, you can't dim the colored light. I also liked that it has a battery so that the clock and alarm time don't have to be re-entered in case of a power outage. However, I returned it for the reasons mentioned.
Lighting great, processing insufficient.
I have replaced four light bulbs in the house with these lamps. Unfortunately, I could only replace four because the other two were delivered without sockets - instead, there is a circuit board in their place... There was also nothing in the box. "6 paid - 4 received" is not a good deal. Amazon would probably have handled it generously and quickly, but I only noticed it after the return period. So, I see it as my mistake and I live with it. Nevertheless, it is not a good indication of the quality of these light bulbs - the only reason for deducting two stars. The light itself is great. The rooms are now very bright and evenly illuminated. The light color is more towards cool white. Perfect for hallway, study, workshop, laundry room, etc. For living rooms, I would personally go for warmer light. Comparable to a good old 100-watt bulb. Other lamps can do that too, and maybe I will also receive intact ones according to the order. If my review is helpful, I would appreciate a positive rating. I will try to answer questions quickly.
Great
I received gestures and I would like to share my first impression. Yes, positive. I have been thinking for a long time whether I should order this set or not. ** The material is sturdy and it feels good in the hand. ** The utensils all have a hole in the handle to hang them up. ** The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is particularly practical to use on coated pans. ** They are heat-resistant and can be used up to 440 ℉. ** They also do not transfer heat and can be touched directly. ** However, the dishwasher sometimes leaves water stains on the black silicone. But they disappear shortly after wiping. Finally, I have to say that I am very surprised and can only recommend them.
Selling B-grade goods as new.
Amazon Prime shipping is simply excellent. Delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, we unpacked the faucet and checked all the parts. We noticed that the part had already been installed before. We had to find significant scratches and abrasions on all the assembly parts. The screw connections/hose connections were all damaged. Nevertheless, we installed the part in the sink (unfortunately). Only now did we see that there are also scratch marks/streaks on the chrome-plated faucet itself. This part was probably already delivered and returned. We will keep this faucet and install it in the sink in the basement because it doesn't matter how it looks there. Our conclusion: We will never order such goods through Amazon again, but rather spend a little more at the hardware store where we can get proper goods. I simply find it sad that customers are being deceived like this!
Product itself is great, unfortunately the external sensor broke after only 6 months.
In principle, I am very satisfied with this product. The installation was very easy, and the range is also very good, with no problems with transmission from inside to outside. I also find the design of the device appealing. It is very simple and can be either wall-mounted or set up like a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use, the device that measures the values outside seems to be broken. The thermometer still seems to be intact, as plausible values are still displayed. However, the hygrometer seems to be broken, as it constantly displays completely astronomical values for the outdoor humidity. This is very unfortunate, as the device was installed outside in a protected location, and it is the reason why I am giving this product only two stars.
Powerful mower with weak grass catcher
Apart from the fact that the first delivery attempt is still happily driving around the country with Hermes today, without finding its way to me or back to Amazon, the service from Amazon in triggering a replacement delivery was excellent as always. The lawnmower arrived quickly and made a high-quality impression. The engine is powerful and it produces a nice cutting pattern. The noise level is not particularly impressively low, but okay. The big drawback is unfortunately the grass catcher. Firstly, it is only made of hard plastic at the top and bottom, and in between it is made of fabric. If you set it down when it is full for just a moment, it naturally gets compressed and parts of the contents fall out. But worse is that the actually practical fill level indicator shows red when the grass catcher is only half full. That wouldn't be so bad if the lawnmower didn't start losing large parts of the cuttings from that point on. Emptying the catcher when it is only half full is not a solution for a large lawn area. Therefore, I cleaned the device as well as possible and returned it. Conclusion: Basically a very good lawnmower, but it becomes unusable for me due to the unfortunate design of the grass catcher.
Good device for monitoring
I have two of these devices. The device can be easily integrated via the app. The included plug-in sensor cable is very good and can also be extended if necessary. The device is solidly built. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but to save battery power, they are only displayed once to three times a day (adjustable) in the app. For the following reasons, I only give it 4 stars. - The soft back of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, is difficult to close again. - One of the two devices is in a room with quite thick walls. This device loses connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device does not reconnect by itself, even if you place it near the router. You have to remove the batteries and then reinsert them after a short pause, then it reconnects. It should actually work without removing the batteries. There is always an alarm when the connection is lost. - The alarm sound could be a bit louder.
3D Printer Prusa i3 DIY
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I still haven't been able to properly level the hotbed. The right rear locking screw is completely tightened, but the hotbed is still too high there, and the front right screw is practically falling out because it is not tightened at all, even though the hotbed is still too low. The rods that hold the carriage are straight, as is the table. Maybe someone knows what can be done about this, because it is impossible to print anything like this. Regarding the assembly: The assembly was relatively problem-free, except for the fact that they could have shown how to route the cables, as they have to be rerouted several times, which is very tiring. I have also contacted support, but after a week of waiting, I still haven't received a response. Unfortunately, I can no longer return it. I expected something more.
robust and precise, I am positively surprised.
My old caliper unfortunately gave up the ghost after many years, so I had to get a new one. This one makes a very robust impression and is just as precise after several test measurements. Two batteries are included, so you can start right away. The packaging of the caliper is simple, but fulfills its purpose completely. Otherwise, the caliper leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measuring methods. I can only give it full marks and believe it will last at least as long as the old caliper. I highly recommend it and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household.
Disgusting, persistent odor
I bought the bracelet and haven't worn it for the time being because it emits a disgusting smell. Until today, this smell hasn't gone away, even though it has been constantly "aired out". Since returning it is no longer possible, I have disposed of it. I advise against buying it.
For the price, okay
The stars and balls on this necklace are personally a bit too big for me, so it looks quite bulky. The larger balls are freely movable, which I find quite nice. However, the overall processing of the necklace is very simple, so I have already torn the clasp twice. So far, I have been able to repair it again, but I think it won't last long. But for the cheap price, you can't expect anything really high-quality.
Very beautiful piece of jewelry
A beautifully crafted bracelet - and the simple clasp actually holds! You just have to pull the end through the loop, it can't come undone, amazing! I rubbed it with some leather care, which makes it even softer and more supple. Just a note: if you have something magnetic on your arm, the clasp is made of steel!
Unfortunately junk! I was disappointed already after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that it was used goods. The base station was fine. Now to the function: It only connects after some tinkering... if you follow the instructions, it doesn't work at all, only after I removed a battery from the base station and reinserted it, the transmitters finally connected. Unfortunately, my joy didn't last long because after an hour the connection was lost again, even though the transmitters were next to the base station. Also, the display of the three transmitters was very different! All in all, not usable for me like this! The thing was returned! I would definitely advise against buying it, it only brings trouble!
Transport damage
Hello, I had this garden pump once before, unfortunately after 3.5 years the thread of the internal shaft had rusted off. I bought it again for only one reason, I urgently needed it because of the current drought and I knew the connections of the suction line and the discharge would fit. I hope that the shaft on the previous pump had a production error and that the current pump will last a bit longer. Unfortunately, the new pump had transport damage, the plastic housing was cracked and the ventilation slots were broken. The cardboard box was also damaged on the outside, so I would recommend packing the pump a bit better in the future, instead of just using a thin-walled cardboard box. Nevertheless, I kept the pump because, as described above, I urgently needed it and the cracks in the plastic housing did not affect the pump's performance.
Could have been thought through better. Since I often deal with many different keys, I thought that an organizer would be more convenient than carrying around a huge keychain all the time. At first, everything went well. However, the paint quickly started to come off and the screws had to be tightened constantly. It's nice that you can do it with a penny coin, but only with a penny coin. I couldn't find a suitable slot screwdriver that wouldn't immediately ruin the whole screw. Now, to get to the most annoying part of the whole thing: attaching the keys. It's nice that you can adjust the screw to different sizes or lengths with the different parts, but once you have it all screwed together, you need pliers to take it apart again. Attaching the keys itself is simply a test of patience, balance, and dexterity. In the end, the screw broke off in the thread when I was assembling it for the third time, rendering the whole thing useless. Conclusion: If anything, only for once with all the necessary keys and then never again, but at this price, you can also buy a cheaper alternative.
Do not quite correspond to the specified dimensions
Smooth-running zippers, the material appears robust and all of it in featherweight. Since I have no comparison (my first organizer set), I will only be able to assess the product after the first use. I can already say in advance that the height is lower than stated. At the moment, I still can't really imagine packing everything there, for example, for a three-week vacation. If necessary, the really large items can go directly into the suitcase - as before. It should also be noted that 10 pieces were delivered instead of 8, as there were two smaller bags/pouches included in the round cosmetic bag. Not well-made, I still wanted to mention that. Personally, I am not bothered by the fact that the cosmetic bag has a different shade and is made of different material than the other bags. I see the price-performance ratio as a trial price and that's okay.
So-so
So, I ordered it before Christmas and it worked until after Christmas as well. Now, when I wanted to use it again, it didn't work anymore. Battery? Replaced. But it still doesn't work. So, I might as well have thrown the money directly into the trash can.
Taking care is always good! The application is simple, but one should be very careful when approaching with the brush in order not to damage the needle. I couldn't hear an improvement in sound on my very high-quality turntable.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. Two black cables were included. The battery life lasts a very long time. Definitely sufficient sound quality. I liked that the headphones do not cause any pain even after wearing them for a long time, making them very comfortable. The ear cups are very soft and pleasant to wear. The weight is also kept very low. Recommended purchase in this price range.
stylish dress
Very beautiful dress that is suitable for a variety of occasions. The price-performance ratio is fully in line here, especially since I also purchased it in a flash sale. It fits perfectly in my size, I am glad that I did not order it smaller (as recommended). I just wished that the neckline was not so deep, and the sleeves could use a bit more fabric (if you don't have as slim upper arms as the model in the picture). But all in all, a chic dress for many occasions.
Hands off. It couldn't be worse. I really and seriously didn't expect such garbage to be sold nowadays. The drive is operated on a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop. It can be assumed that the USB ports provide sufficient power. Nevertheless, trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible. DVDs usually work, but Blu-rays are recognized very unreliably at best. The discs have to be inserted multiple times, after which it makes rattling noises like those heard from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives since the 90s. After minutes, you can either restart the computer because nothing works anymore or the disc is finally recognized. But then you must not press pause or skip to a chapter or change the language during the movie or anything at all. This immediately leads to an irreparable freeze. In addition, of course, no Blu-ray software is included. If you buy PowerDVD or something similar for an additional fee, the price of this drive doubles.
Does what it's supposed to, but it's not pretty. First of all, I would like to emphasize that the two USB ports are actually a deception, because only the port that is facing upwards is a USB port. The other plug is only for charging some devices and therefore relatively useless. I didn't know this when I bought it, so I was a little disappointed. I actually needed a second port, and if I had only needed a simple extension, I certainly wouldn't have bought this awkward lump with golden plugs. But apart from the appearance and my misjudgment, the extension cord performs its service very reliably. And due to the weight of the plug, the inserted USB stick doesn't just dangle around like with a regular extension cord. So not a real mistake, but my enthusiasm is limited.
Small but powerful! I bought this product so that I can have an audio output and connect a display to my iPad (Pro). With iOS 12, you can now also transfer data back and forth. This works very well. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Unfortunately, other adapters that I had to return could not do this. The HDMI output is practical. I now have a PS4 controller connected to the tablet via Bluetooth and the HDMI connected to the TV. Charging at the same time is not a problem. Sound is delivered through HDMI. What else do I need my PlayStation for? :P There was a small adapter included that can be attached to the tablet. This is supposed to provide stability and also has a magnetic holder. It doesn't fit with my case, but it still holds securely and makes contact, so... All in all, it's a bit expensive, but justified by the full range of functions. It's also very small and made of a stable piece of aluminum. The price-performance ratio is good.
Lots of performance
Top device. Has been running without any problems for months. It's not exactly lightweight or quiet, but it delivers a good performance. I find the middle temperature setting (Tp setting) to be a bit too cool and therefore I always use level 2. It has also fallen on the tiled floor several times and has survived it well. And I also like the simple design. Competing products often look like spaceships.
Very good
The processing of the brush head has left a very good impression, although the price difference compared to the original is very large, it does not make a cheap impression. In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed. Overall, I found these brushes to be very good and can be recommended without reservation.
Great product with weak battery
We have had the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised. In live mode, the tracking is accurate to about 0.5 meters. In offline mode, when the dog is inside the house, it sometimes jumps a few meters, but this is not bothersome. I would buy it again at any time. However, it would be great if the battery lasted longer. Currently, it lasts about 1.5 days. It would be ideal to have a solution that lasts 7-14 days. There is an XL version available, but unfortunately, it is too big for our taste. We wouldn't need the battery to last that long, and changing it daily is also impractical. One should focus on spending time with the dog, not with its collar :-) . The app also works perfectly.
After a few weeks of garbage
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They fit well and also seem comfortable. However, the lifespan is decreasing more and more. Although my son only wears the shoes for physical education class, the sole is already breaking after a few weeks and the shoes cannot be used anymore. With the last pair, it was also the case that they did not last very long in normal use, but I thought it would be enough for class. Unfortunately, that was not the case. The shoes are expensive garbage and absolutely not recommended.
Fits perfectly - but original? Unfortunately, my last pair of Crocs broke after 5 years, so I happily ordered new ones. These ones, however, seem poorly made at first glance. They are just as comfortable as the ones I had before. At first glance, there doesn't seem to be any noticeable difference, but upon closer inspection, you can see that the edges are poorly finished and the strap at the heel sits quite loosely and most likely won't last five years like my previous ones. I am curious!
Surprisingly good
Since there are hardly any reviews to read here, I was initially very skeptical. However, since I am going to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I decided to order it on a whim. The delivery included the mattress and a car air pump. Regarding the mattress: I laid it out in the car (Citroen Berlingo) for a test. I noticed that there was some mold on one side. I wiped it off and hope that it doesn't reappear. In the inflated state, a lying test was immediately conducted. It is comfortable to lie on and perfect for the festival. Of course, this mattress cannot replace your own bed, but for days at the event, it is pure luxury. The mattress fits perfectly in my car. We had previously removed the rear seats, so it fits perfectly. The air pump: The air pump has various adapters. The mattress requires two different adapters, which can also be found on the pump. The pump is plugged into the car's cigarette lighter. However, the plug was defective (something at the solder joint). Since my friend is skilled in craftsmanship, he was able to repair it and once reassembled, the good part worked excellently and inflated the mattress in no time. Overall, I am very impressed with the mattress. I am curious about the durability test at the festival. I hope that it doesn't lose air and lasts a long time. Likewise, I hope that the mold does not reappear. After the test, I can definitely recommend it. If I have any other experiences, I will revise the review accordingly (if possible).
Definitely not worth more than 10€... Unfortunately, I can only give the calendar two stars. :( 1. For the fast shipping. 2. For the idea of the toy. Unfortunately, the calendar was torn open on several doors right on day 1 due to the shoddy craftsmanship. There were no doors left on door 21, and I had to allow my son to take out the remaining parts because they were practically falling out on their own. The pieces often come out mixed up, which means that you have to take the car apart again to attach the parts. After the car is fully assembled, parts fall off while playing. (Especially the windshield. It is also very difficult to reattach.) I would not buy this calendar again and would not recommend it to anyone else. Perhaps the manufacturers will reconsider the way they designed the calendar for the next edition and do it better. :\
a real drone
I am thrilled with the drone. My 7-year-old daughter flies it. It flies very well indoors and the 5-minute flight time is usually sufficient. I didn't expect anything different at this price, that hair gets stuck in it and the drone breaks very quickly, but falls from the ceiling to the floor, whether it's tiles or carpet, are not a problem. Friendly contact for any questions.
Game okay but only playable with Steam. When I bought it, I didn't realize that it's not a game CD but only a code with which you can download the game. That would be fine so far, but you are forced to install Steam in order to be able to play it at all, which is outrageous. Since then, my computer constantly crashes, which wouldn't happen with just a pure installation of the game.
Unfortunately, it fails due to the battery's runtime.
I was really looking forward to the watch. The design and appearance were great, and messages etc. were displayed without any problems. The operation worked well... and yet I am sending it back. The big drawback: the battery and its runtime. Charged in the evening, just lying on the shelf overnight, and in the morning, there was 11% less battery when not in use. If there were many messages during the day, the battery would already be empty by noon/early afternoon, and then you couldn't even read the time anymore. Therefore, not usable for me. Very unfortunate.
Noble case with limitations
For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+, it is definitely advisable to get a case. I have recently liked cases that also have slots for credit cards. This case offers that feature. If you insert cards into all 3 slots, it becomes too much and the cover stands slightly high. One is enough for me. The leather case gives a sturdy impression and seems to be well-made. It looks elegant. Unlike many other cases, the phone is embedded all around, with only openings for the ports. Otherwise, the power button and volume controls on the sides can be easily operated through the case. The disadvantage is that on some QI chargers, it is not possible to charge the phone due to the thickness of the case. Even on the TORRO leather QI charging station, it doesn't work. Accessories, such as the Galaxy Buds, can only be charged when the case is off. Otherwise, it is really stylish and well-made!
high-quality case with tempered glass film
Robust case with a proper tempered glass for screen protection in a classic design offers all-around protection for the entire iPhone 11. Fits very well and can also be easily put on. The material feels pleasant in the hand and does not get dirty. A truly successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio. This case provides some grip to the phone. It is not too bulky and fits securely on the phone. Overall, a good purchase.
