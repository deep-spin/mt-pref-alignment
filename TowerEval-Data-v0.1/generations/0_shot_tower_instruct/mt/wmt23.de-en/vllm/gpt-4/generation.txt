Diego Cocca will be the new national coach of Mexico.
In the summer of 2026, Mexico, together with the USA and Canada, will host the World Cup with 48 teams for the first time. Cocca succeeds Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not extended after the early World Cup exit in Qatar. The 50-year-old was not among the favorites for the position until a few days ago. He only took over as coach of the Mexican club Tigres in November. His surprising appointment as national coach caused upset within the club.
Geesthacht: New bed signs are intended to encourage replanting
Franko Stein (FD Environment, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) set up the plant signs in the flower beds of the pedestrian zone.
The campaign "Geesthacht in Bloom" also includes information about what is currently blooming there - currently in the colors white and pink.
Geesthacht. "Geesthacht in Bloom" is a campaign by Nabu in cooperation with the city administration. With the participation of many volunteers from clubs, schools, daycare centers, companies, and institutions, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been planted since 2015. The goal: to create widespread blooming islands throughout the Geesthacht city area, where insects can find food at any time. "If the weather is favorable, the bees start flying out in January to look for food," says Friedhelm Ringe from Geesthacht Nabu. He himself has beehives on his property.
In order for the project to not only remain an action of conservationists and the city's environmental service, but to also reach into private gardens, explanatory signs about the plants are repeatedly put up. About 50 signs have been put up so far. Passersby should be able to inform themselves in this way about what is blooming so beautifully here. The hope is that hobby gardeners will deliberately plant the same at home.
The wild hazel season had already started in the first week of January.
Shrubs such as winter fragrant hedge cherry and winter snowball, which are of recent date, are found in the flower beds of the pedestrian zone. They have now been in the soil of the tubs on Bergedorfer Street for a year, currently showing the first delicate blossoms in white and pink without leaves, and have recently been provided with additional signs. "The winter fragrant hedge cherry is a very bushy shrub and can grow between two meters high and three meters wide," can be read there, among other information about the suitable location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that not only the garden plants are now showing flowers. The wild hazel season had already started in the first week of January. It blooms particularly abundantly on Richtweg near the slope, in Gutenbergstraße, Wilhelm-Holert-Straße, Fahrendofer Weg and many hedgerows.
Ernestine is 102 years old: "Stepping keeps me young"
Munich - Dance god Fred Astaire would surely be proud of them if he were looking down from heaven to Munich East Station!
Every Monday, at exactly 3 p.m., three ladies meet at the "Mandolin Motion Show Academy" for a lively tap dance session - together, they are an incredible 277 years old, or rather young!
The oldest among them is Ernestine Stauchner, who recently celebrated her 102nd birthday.
For the native Munich woman (born January 15, 1921) from Schwanthaler Höh, Monday is THE highlight of the week. "Dancing and tap dancing is my life, I can't imagine without it."
Along with Ernestine, Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) also hit the dance floor.
The 97-year-old was born in 1926 in Jena (Thuringia). She was a soubrette, today one would call her a musical actress, and she worked with the legendary Marika Rökk. "I spent my life dancing, acting, and singing."
At 79 years old, Elfriede Widmann is somewhat of the baby in the group of tap dancers. She says: "We simply have fun here with our dance teacher Sissy Engl".
Wikipedia: Tap dance was developed in the 19th century in the USA and is now known all over the world. With two metal plates, which are more durable than the initially used wooden soles, attached to the front and back of the shoes, rhythmic sounds are produced while dancing, which match the visual impression and the music. The dancer thus also becomes a percussion musician. The English term for this is onomatopoeically Tap dance and the French is Claquettes. The Spanish Flamenco could have influenced tap dance. The tips of the shoes are nailed to produce a clearly audible sound while dancing.
The 77-year-old Sissi Engl is the heart and soul of the dance studio at Ostbahnhof. She is an actress, dancer, and choreographer. "We are a big family, everyone is welcome here, young and old, big and small."
And what is the recipe for such a long life? "Movement keeps me young," the 102-year-old tells BILD. Her advice to everyone: "Exercise, healthy eating, and no alcohol."
Analog in Dialogue - The Limits of the Digital
With advancing digitization, some people are once again developing a desire for analog.
The rapid pace at which our everyday life became digital left us with hardly any time to establish rules for dealing with it and to adapt our communication and work methods accordingly, believes DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden. If you wanted to make a phone call in Bautzen in 1985, there were three options. Either you were among the lucky six percent who had a private connection. Or you were among those who knew someone from this exclusive group in the neighborhood and could make a call to relatives there for a bottle of Radeberger. Or you sought out a phone booth. The unforgettable smell of the plastic receiver and the clicking of small coins in the machine. My biggest dream was to be able to see the face of the person I was calling - video telephony, I thought, what a great thing that would be!
What's next in Moldova? 14 days for a new government
In Moldova (also: Moldavia), President Maia Sandu has tasked former Interior Minister Dorin Recean with forming the government.
The 48-year-old economic expert now has 14 days for this. So far, Recean has been one of the president's advisors.
After only one and a half years in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita surprisingly resigned. The pro-European head of government was under massive pressure, as she herself explained as the reason for her resignation - apparently, she was antagonized by pro-Russian forces.
The President thanked Gavrilita for her "enormous sacrifice".
Moldova is a neighboring country of Ukraine and is suffering from the economic consequences of the war. Inflation is over 40 percent and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the Parliament in Chisinau, the pro-European party PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity) founded by President Sandu holds a comfortable majority, as it occupies 63 out of 101 seats. Therefore, the confirmation of the new Prime Minister and his cabinet should not pose a problem.
However, pro-European politicians in Moldova have lost popularity in recent months, while pro-Russian ones - with support from the Kremlin - have become more popular.
These were the costumes of the celebrities
In 2023, there will be a grand celebration again in Veitshöchheim. The 5th season is in full swing and the celebrities didn't need much convincing to attend.
State father Markus Söder did not go as Moses, as his costume might suggest. He rather sees himself as the tribal elder of the Bavarians. By his side is his wife Karin Baumüller-Söder.
Bavaria's Minister for the Environment and Consumer Protection, Thorsten Glauber, has chosen the children's hero Chase from Paw Patrol for his costume.
Justice Minister Georg Eisenreich and his wife Anja came to Franconia from the depths of the sea.
Completely out of this world: Minister for Science and Art, Markus Blume, is drawn to space.
Parliamentary President Ilse Aigner chose none other than "Mama Bavaria" as the model for her costume.
In peace-and-love mode: Bavaria's Health Minister Klaus Holetschek along with his wife Birgit.
Bob the Builder, also known as Building Minister Christian Bernreiter, with his wife Ann-Kathrin Jandt-Bernreiter as Wendy.
Bavaria's Golden Boy: Finance Minister Albert Füracker with his wife Evelyne. She wore silver.
He even plays the sheriff during Carnival: Bavaria's Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann. By his side, his wife Gerswid.
On the Road: Minister of Economic Affairs, Hubert Aiwanger, pays tribute to the crafts with his costume. His partner, Tanja Schweiger, district administrator of the Regensburg district, follows suit.
Of course, the political opposition could not be missing either.
Everything for Bavaria: Green Party parliamentary group leader Katharina Schulze as Bavaria and her co-leader Ludwig Hartmann as the Bavarian Lion.
Hiking is the joy of the SPD parliamentary group leader: Florian von Brunn with SPD state chairman Ronja Endres.
It got royal with FDP parliamentary group leader Martin Hagen. He and his wife Anisha came as Harry and Meghan.
Otherwise, he certainly speaks more. In Veitshöchheim, the leader of the parliamentary group in the EU Parliament, Manfred Weber, was out and about as a mime. By his side was Mrs. Andrea.
If politics doesn't work out, he can always resort to magic. Nuremberg's Mayor Marcus König as Harry Potter and his wife Anke as Hermione.
Swift as a bee on the move: Bavaria's Digital Minister Judith Gerlach.
Back to the 1920s: the legal director of BR, Eva Majuntke, BR director Katja Wildermuth, and BR culture program director Björn Wilhelm.
A small jab at the climate activists from Franconian crime scene investigator Sebastian Fleischer, played by Alexander Leopold Schadt.
The First Mayor of Veitshöchheim, of course, could not be absent. Jürgen Götz and his wife Julia.
Oberhof: Kühn finishes eighth in the World Championship Sprint
Bö continued his impressive streak despite difficult conditions, winning the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic champion has now collected 14 World Championship titles and is closing in on his compatriot Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, who is on site as a TV expert, is still the undisputed record champion with 20 World Championship gold medals. Even occasional heavy fog did not prevent perennial winner Bö from collecting his second gold at Rennsteig. On Wednesday, he had already successfully defended his title with Norway's mixed relay team.
Hardly anyone doubts that he will come third in the hunting race. In the pursuit, Bö is once again the clear favorite. His running form is outstanding, so he can compensate for shooting errors to a certain extent with frightening ease.
Meanwhile, things were not going well for Doll. After the veteran had squandered all chances of a medal in the mixed relay due to a penalty lap and only managed to secure sixth place, things did not improve three days later. Three penalty laps in the prone shooting and two more while standing were a huge disappointment for the oldest member of the German team, who had celebrated the greatest success of his career in this discipline in 2017.
In Hochfilzen, he surprisingly won six years ago with a slim lead of 0.7 seconds ahead of Bö. It was one of only three career victories for Doll, who has so far stood on the podium once this winter. The eighth-place finisher from the Beijing Olympics left wordlessly after his weak performance and initially gave no interviews. Roman Rees made it to 19th place, while the second World Championship debutant, David Zobel, finished in 35th place.
Biden welcomes Lula: "Must stand up for democracy"
A meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is primarily about the value of democracy. Both are reflecting on their predecessors.
US President Joe Biden emphasized the preservation of democratic values during a visit from his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
"The strong democracy of our two nations was put to the test," Biden said on Friday at the White House in Washington. "We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that form the core of our strength." Lula responded, referring to his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro: "Brazil has been isolated for four years."
The left-wing politician Lula had prevailed against Bolsonaro in a runoff election at the end of October. Lula took office on January 1st. The transfer of power was accompanied by severe riots. Bolsonaro's supporters stormed the Congress, the Supreme Court, and the government headquarters in the capital Brasília in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil eerily echoes the storming of the US Capitol just over two years ago, when supporters of then-President Donald Trump violently broke into the Parliament in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro during the meeting with Biden. His predecessor did not place much value on international relations. "His world began and ended with fake news, morning, noon, and night," said Lula. "Sounds familiar," Biden retorted - an obvious reference to his predecessor Trump.
Brief note on the press - Friday
Does anyone still remember the RAF wanted posters? They displayed the members of the Red Army Faction who were marked for denunciation and elimination.
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which existed even before Corona, public sentiment was stirred up against the most dangerous opponents of the Federal Republic of Germany; let's say of bourgeois democracy, let's say of late capitalist society. (Nothing here about the truly dangerous ones in pinstripe suits and ties.)
Now, the Stuttgarter Zeitung, which usually chases after rowdies on the S-Bahn or masturbators in the park, is releasing a new edition featuring the friends of "war criminal" Putin. Because they are so beautiful, there is a photo gallery. Of course, the StZ is poorly informed, because in this world, which includes Asia, Africa, and Latin America, there may be more "friends of Russia" than the StZ has space for pictures.
But that's not the point, instead: Ms. Wagenknecht ranks from 1st to 5th place (!), followed by Ms. Schwarzer.
Well, I don't know anyone in my surroundings who still reads this paper. If there is, it would be high time now. We have reached the well-known level where there is nothing left below it.
And by now, in a good dialectical sense, Ms. Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician among all those who are not yet completely stupefied, i.e. peace-loving, pacifist, and anti-militarist people. (And no further differentiation is necessary here.)
Harald Glööckler files for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth
Designer Harald Glööckler (57) and his husband Dieter Schroth (74) have separated. This was confirmed by Glööckler's lawyer, Christian-Oliver Moser, to the "Bild" newspaper and RTL in the same wording. There he said: "I can confirm that my client has filed a request through his family lawyer at the responsible court to dissolve his civil partnership. I will not comment on the details."
Glööckler and his life partner Schroth had been together for 35 years, with rumors of a separation circulating for about a year. After his participation in the jungle camp, the fashion designer is said to have already moved from their shared house in the Palatinate to Berlin, according to various media reports. He also spoke about marital problems on the RTL show.
SS Massacre in Oradour-sur-Glane: Last Survivor Dead
In the destroyed village northwest of Limoges, whose ruins were preserved, a memorial center was established in 1999. France's President Emmanuel Macron awarded Hébras with the national Order of Merit a year ago. Hébras had fought for freedom and defended the values of France, said Macron. Moreover, he had contributed to the German-French peace. The survivor had also advocated for German-French youth encounters.
A curve location for 14 houses: In Homeien, everyone knows everyone.
LZ Series Northern Lippe Hamlets: In Homeien, it is not uncommon for three or four generations to live under one roof. Here, residents find pure idyll. In the summer, up to 300 motorcycles per day may roar along the winding route between Niedermeien and Hillentrup - and some even turn right back around.
Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing considers further interest rate hikes absolutely necessary in the fight against high inflation rates. "The inflationary risks remain high. Energy costs can easily rise again, and the opening of China can temporarily boost prices," Sewing told "Welt am Sonntag".
In early February, the European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates in the Eurozone for the fifth consecutive time and indicated a further increase of another 0.5 percentage points for the meeting on March 16. The prime rate in the Eurozone is now at 3.0 percent. The deposit rate, which commercial banks receive when they park money at the ECB, is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates make loans more expensive. This can curb demand and thus counteract high inflation rates. At the same time, higher loan interest rates can lead to investments being postponed, thereby weakening economic growth.
Rising interest rates are also a burden for highly indebted Eurozone countries like Italy. "The consequences of persistently high inflation are significantly more severe than higher financing costs for some countries," said Sewing. "Of course, we must keep this in mind, but a high level of debt should not prevent the ECB from acting decisively."
The ECB aims for price stability in the euro area in the medium term with an inflation rate of two percent. This target has been far off for months. In January, the price increase weakened again, yet consumer prices in the currency area of the now 20 countries were 8.5 percent above the level of the same month last year.
Higher inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of consumers, as they can afford less for one euro. Sharply increased energy prices, which significantly drive inflation, are also a burden for companies.
"If inflation remains high, private consumption will 'sooner or later collapse'," warned Sewing, who is also the president of the Federal Association of German Banks (BdB). "I currently see this as the greatest danger to the German economy. But I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario."
Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung hopes for a broad debate on the "Germany-Tempo" for infrastructure projects announced by Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD). "There will have to be a political and societal dialogue about this. And it may also be a bit more controversial," he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart. He hopes that in the end a set of rules will emerge, with which it does not necessarily have to go as fast as with the LNG terminals put into operation around the turn of the year - but also not as slow as before.
In mid-December, after ten months of planning and construction, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened. The goal was to close the gap in gas supply due to the lack of Russian gas deliveries. Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) spoke of a new "Germany pace" on this occasion. In addition, the federal government recently initiated a speed-up of approval processes for wind turbines and power lines.
"First of all, it is very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it matters. However, this should not automatically mean that we always act so categorically and, for example, put a wind turbine in the neighbor's garden against their will," said Hartung. Therefore, there must always be a negotiation process about what we as a society consider right and wrong.
In the past, we tried with the classic set of rules and did not succeed. "We should reconsider whether our previous approach was really correct. Maybe we overdid it with the rules and made it too complicated for ourselves."
Given the many outstanding tasks, such as expanding the power lines, Hartung said he does not envy the federal government and the companies involved. "As a consumer of these energies, I absolutely need the expansion and it should be as green as possible."
Union warns against dismantling of Bayer Group
The Chemical Workers' Union IG BCE has issued a warning against the breakup of the Bayer corporation following an announced change in leadership. "From the employees' perspective, Bayer is perfectly positioned for the challenges of the future with its three pillars," said Francesco Grioli, board member of the union and Bayer supervisory board member, to the "Rheinische Post" (Saturday edition).
The reference is to the pharmaceutical business with prescription drugs, the Consumer Health sector with over-the-counter drugs, and the agricultural business. "The transformation of the industry can only be managed with a corporate policy based on risk diversification and sustainability - not on hedge fund activism."
The background is the announced change of CEO at the pharmaceutical and agrochemical conglomerate on Thursday. The controversial CEO Werner Baumann will vacate his position this summer. The former pharmaceutical head of the Swiss rival Roche, Bill Anderson, is expected to take over in early June.
Baumann has been under criticism for a long time. The 2018 acquisition of the US seed manufacturer Monsanto for 63 billion dollars still haunts the manager. With the purchase, the Leverkusen-based company brought expensive legal disputes about alleged cancer risks of the weed killer glyphosate upon themselves. The Bayer stock has been in decline for years. In 2019, the shareholders even refused to exonerate the CEO at the annual general meeting.
It had been known for some time that Baumann was not seeking to extend his contract, which was originally supposed to run until 2024. Long-term strategic investors had been applying pressure. Recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors such as Bluebell Capital also got involved. According to a media report, Bluebell is pushing for a split of the corporation.
The very small fund with an unknown stake in Bayer is known for its aggressive approach. A spin-off of the "Consumer Health division could be a possible way to increase the company's value," said Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, to the "Rheinische Post". However, he does not consider a spin-off of the much larger Crop Science agricultural division to be feasible.
Hundreds of thousands want to protest against pension reform
Paris
On Saturday, the French also want to take to the streets again to protest against the planned pension reform.
The unions are opposing a government initiative with concentrated protests on the streets. Hundreds of thousands plan to demonstrate again against the pension reform on Saturday.
Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to take to the streets across France again on Saturday to protest against President Emmanuel Macron's planned pension reform. For the fourth time, unions are mobilizing against the government's plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 years. Twice already, over a million people have taken to the streets and there have been nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 participants were counted at protests. A turbulent debate on the controversial reform has been ongoing in parliament for a week.
Already, many people in France are working longer than until the age of 62, if they have not paid into their pension long enough to receive a full retirement without deductions. Opponents of the reform believe that people in many strenuous jobs could hardly work any longer. Moreover, employees want to be able to enjoy their well-deserved retirement and not completely wear out their health at work.
Macron: Looming Deficit in Pension Fund
Macron justifies the reform with a looming deficit in the pension fund. As the population is getting older, employees would have to cover an increasing number of retirees with their contributions. In order to keep the pension amount stable, the population would have to work a bit more. Critics question the government's calculations and demand that the state must find other sources of money to keep the pension system balanced.
However, the government does not only want to adjust the retirement age. The previously decided increase in the necessary contribution period for a full pension is to be accelerated. In addition, individual pension systems with privileges for certain professional groups are to be abolished. The minimum pension is expected to rise to around 1200 Euros.
The pension reform is considered one of President Macron's most important initiatives. During the coronavirus pandemic, an initial attempt to implement the reform was abandoned, even then there were massive protests and strikes. Several presidents before Macron have tried with varying success to reform the French pension system - widespread protests and strikes were a certainty for all.
Since Macron's camp no longer has an absolute majority in parliament, it hopes to push through the reform with the help of the conservative Républicains, who have announced their support. However, some of the deputies - even from Macron's own faction - still have reservations. And currently, Macron's fear of paralyzing strikes may be greater than the fear of a close vote. Before the renewed demonstrations on Saturday, the president said that he could count on the sense of responsibility of the organizers to ensure that they proceeded calmly and did not lead to a blockade of the country.
Calm weather expected - lots of sun in high altitudes
A powerful high-pressure area is located over Central Europe and determines the weather in Germany. Does this mean that we can expect a lot of sunshine everywhere?
Offenbach
Calm high-pressure weather is expected in Germany at least until midweek. "When looking at the weather maps, a powerful high-pressure area directly over Central Europe immediately catches the eye," explains meteorologist Markus Übel from the German Weather Service on Saturday in Offenbach. "Although this high shifts a little to the east over the course of the next week, it continues to determine the weather in Germany."
However, calm high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Übel. "Such a high can even be quite mean and bestow people in the lowlands with days of dreary high fog grey, while there is pure sunshine in the high altitudes of the low mountain ranges".
The Sunday starts off foggy and overcast in most regions. According to the German Meteorological Service (DWD), there may still be some rain from the Ore Mountains and the Thuringian Forest to Lower Bavaria. Especially on the edge of the Alps, but also in the southwest and partly in the west, the cloud cover will clear up during the day and the sun will appear more and more often. In the rest of the country, it remains heavily cloudy or covered with high fog. Temperatures will reach 4 to 9 degrees, around 10 degrees near the Rhine.
"On Monday, the gradually strengthening sun will again nibble at the high fog and can dissolve it more and more throughout the day," says the meteorologist. Full-day sunshine is expected at the edge of the Alps, in the high altitudes of the central mountains, and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, elsewhere it has to fight its way through the high fog layer. The maximum temperatures are between 5 and 9 degrees, around 11 degrees are expected at the Lower Rhine, while in the persistent gray in the southeast, only around 3 degrees are expected. There will also be a light wind blowing from different directions.
On Tuesday, in some low-lying areas, there may again only be slow dissipation of fog or high fog. Otherwise, the weather will be clear after the fog has lifted. According to forecasts, the sun will shine all day in high-altitude areas, in large parts of NRW, and on the edge of the Alps. Depending on the sunshine, temperatures will climb to between 5 and 11 degrees.
Dominator struggles: Yet again, no World Championship medal for Goggia
The defeated top favorite, Sofia Goggia, showed great disappointment after her elimination in the downhill event of the Alpine Ski World Championships.
Méribel
"I am sad because I did not perform as well as I know I can," said the Italian woman on ZDF, after she had threaded through a gate and was eliminated. At least the 30-year-old was able to prevent a potentially serious fall.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill skier in the World Cup for years. She has won four of the six season races in this discipline so far. After winning gold in 2018 in Pyeongchang, she took silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. However, Goggia, known for her risky driving style, still has to wait for a World Championship medal in her signature discipline. She was absent due to injury at her home game in Cortina d'Ampezzo two years ago.
"I actually thought I was in good shape. It was a matter of hundredths of a second," Goggia said after the surprising victory of Swiss Jasmine Flury in French Méribel. "I'm disappointed. I gave it my all. But that's life." Sometimes you think things are guaranteed, she said about the medal that all experts expected and ultimately missed: "But they are not."
Girl missing in Berlin: Who has seen Viktoriya?
Viktoriya Stankovych has been missing since February 10th.
Viktoriya Stankovych was last seen on Friday at the Waidmannslust S-Bahn station. The police are asking for any information regarding her whereabouts.
Berlin. With the publication of a photo, the Berlin Police are asking the public for assistance in the search for a missing child. The 12-year-old Viktoriya Stankovych is believed to have left the grounds of her school with other children towards the Waidmannslust S-Bahn station on February 10, 2023, around 12.30 pm. She was last seen there at the S-Bahn station. The child has been in Berlin as a refugee since April 2022 and has very limited German language skills and local knowledge.

Zelensky and Minister against Russia's Olympic participation
Kiev. With the demand for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, sports politicians from 35 nations have increased pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
It was agreed in a joint teleconference to draft a statement to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sports competitions, the Lithuanian Ministry of Sports announced on its website.
"We demand the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues," said Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė.
The video consultation took place at the initiative of the United Kingdom. "It was a very productive meeting," wrote British Sports Minister Lucy Frazer on Twitter. "And I made the UK's position very clear: As long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus should not be represented at the Olympic Games. We will now issue a joint statement on this matter."
Previously, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had protested against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions during an international video conference of sports ministers and other high-ranking representatives. "While Russia is killing and terrorizing, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions," said Zelensky. He published his speech on his Telegram channel. Due to the Russian war of aggression, ultimately even a neutral flag is soaked in blood and unbearable.
Ukraine threatens with boycott
Ukraine also views Belarus as a party to the war because the country is providing military bases for Russian troops to launch attacks. Zelensky called on officials to stand up for the protection of Olympic principles and to prevent the admission of Russian athletes to the competitions. The president also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which he said has unfortunately lost its integrity.
The reason for the conference was the announcement by the IOC to potentially allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international competitions under certain conditions. Ukraine is also threatening to boycott if the IOC allows the athletes to compete.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a position
The Federal Ministry of the Interior, responsible for sports, subsequently stated that it had reaffirmed during the discussions its rejection of Russian and Belarusian athletes participating in Paris. "In our view, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian sports back into the competitions. Unrestricted solidarity and support from the international sports community must continue to be extended to Ukrainian athletes. The IOC's efforts to reinstate Russian and Belarusian athletes is the wrong approach," a spokesperson for the Ministry of the Interior told dpa upon request.
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) had already emphasized at the end of January: "Sport should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against the Ukrainian civilian population. Major sporting events do not take place in a vacuum." Russia, on the other hand, insists that sport and politics must be separated.
Currently, Russia and Belarus are excluded from many international sports competitions. However, the IOC is aiming for a return of athletes from both countries to the international sports stage under a neutral flag, provided they clearly commit to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach recently stated that exclusion "because of a passport or place of birth" violates the prohibition of discrimination.

"Hey, nice butt!", whistling after the jester in the skimpy sexy costume and shouting suggestive comments: All of this falls under the term "catcalling". Behind this term is nothing less than a form of verbal sexual harassment in public spaces.
Half of the vehicles lost? : USA sees Moscow's tank inventory greatly reduced
Half of the vehicles lost? USA sees Moscow's tank inventory greatly reduced
The Pentagon assumes that Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the start of the war. They are referring to "half of the main stock".
The Russian army has already lost half of its battle tanks in its war of aggression against Ukraine, according to estimates by the US Department of Defense. "Probably half of the main stock of tanks" of the Russian army has been "destroyed or seized by Ukraine," said Celeste Wallander, Under Secretary for International Security Affairs at the US Department of Defense.
Wallander did not provide any further details on the number of tanks seized and destroyed according to US estimates during an online event of the think tank Center for a New American Security.
Ukraine is expected to receive battle tanks from several Western allies in the coming weeks. The UK has promised to deliver Challenger-2 battle tanks to Kiev in March. Germany, in a coalition with other countries, plans to deliver a battalion of Leopard-2 tanks to Ukraine by April. The US has also pledged a battalion of 31 Abrams-type battle tanks. However, their delivery is expected to take significantly longer.
Russia Wants to Step Up
In response to Western military aid, former Kremlin chief Dmitry Medvedev promised the construction and modernization of thousands of tanks. "As we know, our enemy abroad has begged for planes, missiles, tanks," said Medvedev, who is now the deputy head of the Russian Security Council, during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. "It is clear that in this case, it is natural for us to increase the production of various types of weapons and military equipment - including modern tanks."
Since last summer, a law has been in effect in Russia that allows for a stronger focus of the economy on the needs of the army. This means that individual sectors can be obligated to supply the armed forces.
Controversy over army position appointments
Because the position that Christian Ortner, the former director of the Museum of Military History (HGM), will hold in the future, was not advertised. The personnel representative of the academy, Herwig Jedlaucnik, suspects job corruption and abuse of office. Defense Minister Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends the procedure.
A tender was not necessary because the appointment was for a previously unoccupied position, said the minister. She did not want to comment on the "speculations of a liberal staff representative". Ortner was replaced last year after 17 years at the helm of the HGM. In addition to criticism of the museum's handling of Austria's military past, he was faced with serious allegations of bullying. From Tanner's perspective, these have been resolved.
Jedlaucnik also doubts Ortner's suitability in terms of content. He is an expert on the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current issues of security policy.
The SPÖ demands clarification from Tanner about the "unusual ordering process". The decision has the "appearance of cronyism", says SPÖ defense spokesman Robert Laimer. The Neos call on Tanner to revoke the appointment. The ÖVP is "still neck-deep in the swamp of corruption", said Douglas Hoyos, spokesman for national defense. He announced a parliamentary inquiry on the subject.
Carnival: First fools buckle under the costs
Unlike the state capital, Thuringia's carnival stronghold Wasungen wants to stick to the traditional carnival parade. However, the higher costs, including for security, are also difficult to manage in Wasungen, says Carnival President Marcel Kißling. The funds for this alone make up about half of the estimated total costs for the parade.
In Brandenburg, no carnival parades are being cancelled. The "Parade of Happy People" in Cottbus, likely once again the largest in East Germany, is taking place for the first time since the pandemic. No parades were cancelled for the Swabian-Alemannic Fastnacht either.
Despite rising costs, Schleswig-Holstein's carnival stronghold Marne is sticking to its traditional parade. "We are going through with our event," says the president of the Carnival Society, Heiko Claußen. But financial worries are also pressing here: if more sponsors are not found, or if the existing ones do not contribute more, reserves would have to be tapped into - "this can't happen every year". The current deficit: about 200,000 euros.
And inflation: In the case of confectionery, there is a price increase of up to 60 percent, says Elvira Reuther from the Nuremberg Carnival Parade Association. Fortunately, in 2020 too much was ordered, which is why there is still enough stock this time. However, it is already certain that the parade will be more expensive. Twice as much staff will be needed for security as in 2020.
Those standing on the sidelines of the Rose Monday parade in the Rhineland might receive fewer sweets than in the past. Because candies have become more expensive, some parade participants don't have as many to give out. Regardless of the candy situation, the crowd is expected to be large: "I believe that if it doesn't rain buckets on that day, we can certainly expect a larger crowd," says Cologne parade leader Holger Kirsch. "This is due to the fact that there hasn't been a regular Rose Monday parade for two years. The parade, of course, is irreplaceable."
The festival committee in Cologne does not comment on costs in detail. However, the parade is generally "deficit-ridden", which is no secret.
The Ukraine Diary: Dreams and Homemade Vodka
Ukrainians are not known for their drinking prowess for nothing. There is local beer like Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lviv. Every now and then, I discover German beer here. Not Kulmbacher, but other large breweries like Krombacher or Warsteiner. I can't really taste a big difference. The same applies to vodka, which is widely consumed. They distill it themselves, especially in the villages. They call it Samargon. No one knows exactly how much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics. A few years ago, the Russian health minister claimed that consumption had dropped by a staggering 80 percent in five years. Well, it just goes to show how little you can trust the Russians. It is said that tourists should be careful with it. But that only applies if it goes on sale in large quantities. There is likely to be some adulteration then.
FC Hansa Rostock rewards itself for great effort: "Match luck on our side"
Eating and Drinking
Those who want to celebrate the weekend with cocktails or enjoy a beer after work will find great places in Rostock and Warnemünde. The restaurant scene offers many locations for after-work meetings or pre-drinks for club parties. Where is the best place? A look at the Google reviews will show it.
Biathlon World Championships: Federal President witnesses favorite's victory and praises Oberhof
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are welcomed at the arena by master chimney sweep Tobias Böttger and the Oberhof mascot "Flocke".
Oberhof. The German biathletes had nothing to do with the medal distribution at the Oberhof World Championship sprint. However, there were two glimmers of hope in the fog.
No matter how hard the Federal President tried, from the grandstand on Saturday it was impossible to see whether the targets at the shooting range were actually falling. "I had to get the results on my phone," admitted Frank-Walter Steinmeier with a smile, referring to the fog banks that kept rolling into the stadium, greatly impairing the view at the Rennsteig for the spectators.
Steinmeier nevertheless enjoyed the visit to the 10-km sprint race at the Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof, receiving numerous tips from Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "Since the Olympic Games in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race, I have been fascinated by biathlon," he revealed and also praised Oberhof for its modernized sports facilities: "The completely renovated arena is fantastic and offers ideal conditions. The athletes say the same - with thanks to those who have been involved here since the World Championships were awarded." He also said that in terms of sustainability, the location is now "one step ahead" of many others and thus "secure for the next years and even decades."
Once again, the Norwegian Johannes Thingnes Bö outpaced the competition in sports. Despite a penalty lap after a shooting error, he secured his sixth win in the sixth sprint of the winter in 23:21.7 minutes - and thus his second World Championship title in Oberhof. Behind him, his error-free shooting brother Tarjei (14.8 seconds behind) and Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 penalty lap/39.9 seconds) as well as Johannes Dale (1/43.6) completed the Norwegian quadruple victory.
The local ski hunters could not intervene in the fight for the medals a day after Denise Herrmann-Wick's triumph. Johannes Kühn finished in eighth place as the best German after a shooting error and with a deficit of 1:04.8 minutes. World Championship debutant Justus Strelow shot flawlessly and finished twelfth (1:14.6). Two bright spots behind the gray veil. In contrast, Benedikt Doll disappointed again. After his botched mixed performance on Wednesday, the Black Forest native left five discs standing this time and disappeared deeply disappointed and without comment into the locker room.
Bö had entered the race as number 1 in front of 14,300 spectators and maintained this status despite the complicated visibility conditions. However, he had the luck of the skilled with his last two standing shots; they each landed on the edge of the targets and still fell. The 29-year-old then enjoyed the award ceremony together with his brother, who is five years older: "It's the best feeling to stand here with him," said the world champion: "We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes."
There is hardly any doubt that the Norwegians will also dominate the pursuit on Sunday. On the other hand, German hopes rest on Herrmann-Wick for the women. "When you start with number one, the goal is not to come in tenth. It's all about full throttle and attack to defend the number one spot," said Sports Director Felix Bitterling, putting his "locomotive" to the task. The organizers expect a nearly sold-out arena for the double event (1:25 pm and 3:30 pm/ZDF and Eurosport live).
Brych dislikes "swarm of bees" on the field
Felix Brych - Referee Felix Brych calls for a drop ball.
Aggressive players or complaining coaches? Germany's referees want to "consistently penalize" unsportsmanlike behavior. Referee chief Fröhlich points out a role model function.
The top German referee, Felix Brych, has identified negative trends in interactions on the field. "I do think that there are new behaviors from players who surround the referee like a swarm of bees after decisions, trying to push him into the review area," the 47-year-old told the German Press Agency. "We discussed this during the winter break. We decided that we do not want to accept such unsportsmanlike behavior. We will pay more attention to this - and we will also sanction it."
Recently, two coaches were also given dismissals. Mainz's coach Bo Svensson received a red card during the cup defeat against FC Bayern. Freiburg's coach Christian Streich received a yellow-red card during the league defeat in Dortmund. "The behavior of the coaches also falls into the category of unsportsmanlike conduct. We have noticed that unsportsmanlike conduct has also increased in this area, that the behavior towards us referees has become a bit more demanding or aggressive. We want to consistently penalize such unsportsmanlike conduct," said Brych.
DFB Referee Chief Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed out a generally good relationship between coaches and referees. "Overall, the relationship is good. There are reactions, followed by consistent counter-reactions. The person concerned has to live with that. It shouldn't be anything earth-shattering," Fröhlich told the German Press Agency.
"Emotions can certainly lead to conflicts during the course of a game. But when these emotions spill over into personal insults, one must also accept that the appropriate measures will be taken by the referee," said Fröhlich. In recent cases, the parties involved have resolved things afterwards. "What would be important is if a process of rethinking could be initiated overall, that such behavior is simply not acceptable," Fröhlich said on the sidelines of an event by the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed out possible impacts at other levels. "Of course, incidents from professional football always have an effect. There is a role model effect, which results in imitation. In the recent cases in the Bundesliga, the referees have consistently reacted to negative behaviors," said Fröhlich. "Regardless of the consistent interpretation of the rules in the game, a clarifying conversation, with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those affected, is always helpful."
Combination skier Oftebro wins in Schonach
The victory was secured by the Norwegian Jens Luraas Oftebro after a jump from the normal hill and the ten-kilometer cross-country ski race, ahead of the overall Austrian leader Johannes Lamparter. Kristjan Ilves from Estonia came in third.
The German combined skiers will not be competing in the Black Forest with their best lineup. Beijing Olympic champions Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel, and Johannes Rydzek will not be participating. They are preparing with training in Oberstdorf for the World Championships, which will take place from February 21 to March 5 in Planica, Slovenia. "We have three world-class athletes at home. The team naturally feels this," said national coach Hermann Weinbuch on ZDF.
Seven minor injuries after rear-end collision on A5
Seven people were slightly injured in an accident involving four vehicles on the Autobahn 5 near Hemsbach (Rhein-Neckar district), including two children. According to a police statement, the rear-end collision occurred on Saturday when a driver hit a car from behind during a minor traffic jam and pushed it into two other cars. The full closure of the lanes towards Heidelberg was lifted after about an hour and a half.
Closing event at the Marler Sculpture Museum
The initiators of the exhibition, Sebastian Freytag (left) and Georg Elben (right), stand with artist Christian Freudenberger in front of his mural.
On Sunday, February 12, an unusual exhibition at the Marler Sculpture Museum comes to an end. There will be some extras for the finale.
The closing event for the exhibition "Wall-bound" will take place on Sunday, February 12, at 3 p.m. in the temporary quarters of the Marler Sculpture Museum located at Georg-Herwegh-Straße 63-67. In three exhibition rooms, two large-format wall paintings each draw attention.
After the exhibition, the walls will be painted over and the artworks will disappear. However, a catalog documents the works specifically created for the Marler Museum. It will be presented by the two curators, Georg Elben and Sebastian Freytag, on February 12th.
At the finissage, Dr. Friederike Schuler will also give a lecture on wall-bound art in the service of the community. Using numerous visual examples, she will present the unique features of wall painting from the Weimar Republic and explore the connections to this art form in the Federal Republic, focusing on North Rhine-Westphalia in the 1950s to 1970s.
Dr. Friederike Schuler is a freelance art historian and curator who completed her doctorate on the mural painting of the Weimar Republic in 2013. Since then, she has been researching building-related art as well as the history of art and institutions in post-war Germany, most recently in collaboration with Sebastian Freytag on art in construction in NRW. After the lecture, the final curator's tour of the exhibition will take place. The artists will be present.
Arrest warrants issued after building collapses in Turkey
It's about construction defects that have facilitated the collapse of buildings: In the Turkish earthquake region, the judicial authorities have issued arrest warrants against dozens of suspects.
Istanbul. In the south of Turkey, dozens of arrest warrants have been issued due to possible construction defects following building collapses during the earthquake. In the city of Diyarbakir, arrest warrants have been issued against 33 people, reported the state news agency Anadolu on Saturday, citing prosecutors. The accused are believed to be responsible for construction defects that may have contributed to the collapse of the buildings.
The prosecutor's office in Adana is also investigating possible construction defects in collapsed buildings, according to Anadolu. As part of these investigations, 62 arrest warrants have been issued so far, it was reported. One of the accused was reportedly apprehended at the airport in Istanbul. He is said to have tried to travel to Montenegro with cash and is now in pre-trial detention, Anadolu reported. Nine other people were reportedly arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.
Early Monday morning, a 7.7 magnitude earthquake shook the Turkish-Syrian border region, followed by another 7.6 magnitude earthquake at noon. More than 7,500 buildings collapsed in Turkey alone as a result.
Former East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow has died.
Hans Modrow has died, as announced by the Left Party faction in the Bundestag. The 95-year-old passed away on Saturday night. Faction leader Dietmar Bartsch honored the former SED functionary and later PDS and Left Party politician as a "deeply sincere socialist".
"Last night, 'Hans Modrow passed away at the age of 95,' announced the Left Party faction in the Bundestag on Saturday. The party thus loses 'a significant personality,' stated the faction leader Dietmar Bartsch and the former faction leader Gregor Gysi.
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the 1st Secretary of the District Leadership of the SED in Dresden. As Prime Minister, he oversaw the end of the GDR. Just four days after the fall of the Berlin Wall, on November 13, 1989, he was appointed Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR - for about 150 days. In the People's Chamber elections on March 18, 1990, the SED/PDS lost power and Modrow lost his office a month later. He was succeeded as the last Prime Minister of the GDR until reunification by CDU politician Lothar de Maizière.
The parliamentary group leader of The Left, Dietmar Bartsch, described Modrow in a message on the microblogging service Twitter as a "deeply sincere and combative socialist". Bartsch added:
"Until old age, he was an important advisor in our party, whose wisdom will be missed."
"The entire peaceful process of the establishment of German unity was particularly due to him. This will remain his political legacy," Bartsch and Gysi wrote in their obituary. It continues:
"His later work in the People's Chamber, the Bundestag, the European Parliament, and as Honorary Chairman of the PDS, always consisted of representing that part of the former GDR population that was not wanted and whose interests were regularly violated."
After the reunification, Modrow served in the German Bundestag for the PDS from 1990 to 1994 and represented them in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
According to a report by the German Press Agency (dpa), Modrow viewed the new state "quite critically". The German unification happened too quickly, the GDR fell too unconditionally, and it was too one-sidedly condemned as a "rogue state", Modrow criticized in many interviews, according to dpa.
What happened in the night
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky condemns Russian missile attacks. Meanwhile, Kiev must carry out emergency repairs on the power grid.
Kyiv - The latest wave of Russian missile attacks is once again forcing emergency repairs on the Ukrainian power grid. However, Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions. Several thermal and hydroelectric power plants have been damaged, said the head of the energy supplier Ukrenerho, Volodymyr Kudryzkyj, on Ukrainian television on Friday evening. The power supply in the Kharkiv region is particularly bad. Due to the instability in the Ukrainian power grid, a reactor block had to be shut down at the Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plant, and production was reduced at the Rivne and South Ukraine nuclear power plants.
President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the Russian attack involving about 100 missiles and cruise missiles on Friday as terrorism. However, in a video message, he told his compatriots about the amount of support Ukraine received during his trip to London, Paris, and Brussels this week.
Zelensky does not want to abandon the small town of Bakhmut.
On February 24, war will have been raging for a year. US President Joe Biden announced a visit to key Ukraine supporter Poland shortly before the anniversary. However, the threat from Russian missile attacks continued into Saturday night. In the capital, Kyiv, an air raid alarm was triggered for the fifth time that day late on Friday evening. "There is a threat of a drone attack," the military administration of the Kyiv region announced. Combat drones of Iranian design were also spotted and shot down over the Mykolaiv and Odessa regions in the south.
German Railways: Federal Government selects consultant for network company
Demands from, among others, the FDP and the Greens during the election campaign to spin this off failed due to the coalition partner SPD. In the coalition agreement, a compromise was reached on the establishment of an infrastructure company, which, however, should be oriented towards the common good in the future. This means that it does not need to generate and distribute profits.
Backlog of renovations worth 80 billion Euros
The two consulting firms are supposed to help the federal government in overseeing this process. The backlog of renovations in the rail network is a major reason why the trains are currently running very late. Transport Minister Wissing has made it his mission to eliminate this problem by completely renovating entire railway corridors. The investments necessary for this have so far been estimated at 50 billion euros. However, according to more recent calculations by the railway, they are likely to be up to 80 billion euros.
Biathlon World Championship in Oberhof 2023 - Gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: "Can someone please pinch me?"
The external circumstances apparently did not favor Herrmann-Wick at all. She had slept poorly, she said after the race, had been "totally excited", her pulse had not come down even during the warm-up. "Such a race", and that at the home World Championship, "you can't describe it with words," she said. 11,000 spectators cheered to the booming pop music with German flags, coaches and team embraced each other.
"Enjoying Biathlon", that's what she had set out to do.
The pressure had been particularly high for Herrmann-Wick. The 34-year-old had started the World Championship as the biggest, if not the only, German medal hope outside of the relay teams. This winter, Herrmann-Wick has been the only German to win two World Cups. She currently ranks fifth in the overall World Cup. And even though the performance density among women at the top is significantly higher than among men, where currently only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians dominate, other competitors were expected to win this sprint.
Criticism of the Government - Bishop in Nicaragua sentenced to 26 years in prison
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-leaning head of state. He accuses Ortega of suppressing religious freedom. Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been highly strained since 2018. At that time, protesters demanding Ortega's resignation found refuge in churches. More than 350 people were killed in the protests in 2018. Thousands of people have left the Central American country in the following years, often out of fear of repression or arrests. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of conspiring with the US government to overthrow him.
German Armed Forces: Defense industry demands more orders from special funds
The first defense projects have therefore already been cancelled, and the same fate threatens further plans, as reported by "Welt am Sonntag". However, it cannot yet be said which specific investments would be cut. "There is no need to assign specific procurement measures to a potential need for savings at this point in time," says a response from the federal government to a query from Bundestag member Ingo Gädechens (CDU).
The background of the decreasing investment sum is the rising interest rates. The special fund, which was fully financed by credit and decided by the Bundestag in June 2022, has to bear the interest burden for the loans itself. If these increase, there is therefore less money available for the specific purchases for the Bundeswehr. In addition, the currently high inflation is causing the purchasing power of the remaining sum to decrease.
Kupferzell: Accident with 3 Injured
On the night of Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.), around 01:40 am, a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from Kupferzell, wanted to turn left at the Kupferzell motorway entrance towards Heilbronn. At this time, a 21-year-old VW driver was traveling on the B 19 towards Künzelsau, as the police reported. During the BMW driver's turning maneuver, there was a collision between the two vehicles.
Both parties involved in the accident claimed that the traffic light system installed at the accident site was showing "green" for them. An inspection of the traffic light system revealed no faults. Further investigations will follow. The 24-year-old, the 21-year-old, and the passenger in the BMW were all slightly injured in the accident. They had to be taken to a hospital. The total damage to both cars is estimated at around 20,000 Euros.
Stuttgart's Schlossplatz commemorates the victims of the earthquake disaster.
Many people from Stuttgart followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib Mosque community on Friday evening.
Tens of thousands of people have died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria. The sympathy is great - also in Stuttgart.
The earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria is preoccupying the world. On Friday evening, more than 200 people gathered at Stuttgart's Schlossplatz to remember the victims and pray for them.
Many community members had heeded the call of the Feuerbach Ditib Mosque community, young and old, women and men alike. They all listened to the Imam's prayer earnestly and silently. In the prayer, the Imam asked Allah for help for the people in the affected areas, so that they could overcome this disaster. He asked, among other things, for health, protection from plagues, and respectful interaction with each other. The community also asked for support and strength to "bring our help to the areas affected by the earthquake".
Ditib stands by the people in Turkey and Syria. The speakers expressed their sympathy for the victims and the relatives of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the memorial event. The prayers were also translated into German at the castle square.
The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border region is strong. The fundraising campaign of the German Islamic Association Turkish-Islamic Union (Ditib) has already raised several million euros.
The Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt has been collecting material donations on Glockenstraße for several days, which are to be transported by truck to the earthquake-affected areas. The willingness to help there was also overwhelming.
Hike with a meat insert - Ebersberg
"After eating, you should rest or take a thousand steps"... The older generation knows this proverb, the younger ones simply put it into practice. Either way, during the years of the pandemic, the good old digestion walk has experienced an unexpected renaissance. Because those who, thanks to home office, are not in the middle of a stone desert, but rather just a stone's throw away from fields, forests and meadows, now use their lunch break either after a quick snack in front of the screen or alternatively for a walk in the fresh air. At least this impression could be gained around Egglburger Lake, where between 12 and 2 pm not only dog owners are bustling about.
One reason could naturally also be that modern humans, in the course of optimal time slot usage, can combine the health-promoting fresh air supply with other things. Because why not learn about the latest news from the settlement from the long-unseen neighbor during a short walk through nature? Or meet the friend with whom you never make it to the cinema in the evening, not even to the old cinema? This way, work and private life could also be combined - who says that the appointment with the tax consultant, lawyer, or investment advisor cannot take place outdoors? Provided there are no eavesdroppers nearby, of course.
What one can also do excellently is the acquisition of natural products. Fresh fruit, for example, that stands next to little cheese boxes on a table at the roadside. Or potatoes and meat. It's just unfortunate if one hasn't thought about the purchase in advance and taken appropriate precautions. Thus, an elderly couple in Hinteregglburg leaves the wooden sales room of the farmer with empty hands and regret in their voices. "Too bad, we unfortunately forgot the money."
The disappointment is understandable, even though one does have a companion with a wallet, but not a container for transportation. This is something you let the friendly stranger know. To which the man replies: "That's not true! You do have a bag with you!" He points to the hood of the jacket that you quickly put on before leaving the house, even though the sunshine makes an additional head covering unnecessary. "My wife always puts everything in there!"
And so it happens that one embarks on the return journey with a meaty addition and not only gains a rack of lamb from this midday short trip, but also an extremely practical idea. It's quite possible that a second walk will be necessary on this day - after dinner. This time, indeed for digestion.
Trapped and seriously injured
Around 9 p.m., the 25-year-old was driving his Audi on the county road towards Hailfingen and, for reasons yet to be determined, veered off the road to the right in a left curve, according to the police report. In the process, the Audi damaged a guide post, collided sideways with a tree, and came to a stop a few meters away. The driver was trapped in his car due to the collision. The fire department freed him using heavy equipment. The emergency service transported the severely injured man to a hospital. Since there was suspicion of driving incapacity, a blood sample was ordered to be taken. According to the police report, the Audi was a total loss, with damages amounting to 1000 Euros.
Donald Trump's Tax Records: Point for the Rule of Law
The US Department of Justice has decided: The financial authority must hand over the tax returns of the former president to the parliament.
Trump 2018, back then still in office as the President of the USA
The Ministry of Finance must instruct the IRS to release the confidential documents to the Finance and Tax Committee, according to the Ministry's decision on Friday.
Contrary to political customs in the USA, the real estate entrepreneur Trump did not make his tax return public either as a candidate or later as president. He resisted its release all the way to the Supreme Court. A prosecutor's office in New York has since received the documents, however, no details were allowed to be made public - unless there was a trial.
The release to Congress is probably more delicate for Trump: there, the circle of those authorized to access is somewhat larger and under certain conditions, individual details could be published during the committee's investigation. Moreover, confidential information is repeatedly leaked from the Parliament.
The Speaker of the House, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, immediately welcomed the decision as a "victory for the rule of law". Access to the Republican's tax records is a matter of national security, she wrote on Twitter. "The American people deserve to know the facts about his conflicts of interest and his undermining of our security as President," Pelosi stated.
Cabaret in the Bastion: Life plays out between birth and death
Kirchheim. Pasta or pizza? Samsung or Apple? Which mobile contract among the many offers? Stay or break up? Either - or? As slaves of time, people today rush from appointment to appointment, sometimes just squeezing in people and hamburgers. Lucy van Kuhl shows in her new program that the "in-between" state has something exciting about it.
In a humorously thoughtful manner, Lucy van Kuhl narrates and sings about situations from life. In her sensitive chansons and crisply pointed cabaret songs, she gets straight to the point - and one thing or another is also implied between the lines. It all starts on Saturday, February 18, at 8:30 pm at the Kirchheim Club Bastion.
British hardened criminal captured in Thailand after long escape
London - After five years on the run, a convicted drug criminal from the UK has been apprehended in Thailand. As reported by the British criminal police NCA on Saturday, the man was arrested by Thai police in a car workshop in Bangkok on Friday. The 55-year-old was on the "Most Wanted" list of criminals most sought after by the NCA.
According to authorities, the leader of a criminal group had fled at the beginning of 2018 before the start of a trial in which he was sentenced in absentia to eleven years in prison for attempting to import amphetamines worth eight million pounds (nine million euros).
Encounters at the Church Table

Cabaret - Stories from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: The trained physicist from Lower Franconia, who has been living in Vienna for three years and, according to his own statement, loves Viennese humor, champions science in his cabaret programs. This fits well with the programmatic title of his current solo "Make Science Great Again". Whether this fits well into the prevailing domestic skepticism about science is debatable. However, his humor certainly fits very well in Vienna.
By the way, the English title is derived from Ebert's recent life story, as he tried to establish himself as a stand-up comedian in New York for a year in 2019. But now he's back and not only shares his experiences overseas with his German-speaking audience, but also explains what science actually is and what it can - and most importantly, cannot - do. Of course, Corona is also mentioned, as well as German thoroughness in the bathroom and American engineering skills.
And he boils it down to the most important question that many people put off: What is really important? All this with a huge wink, calm and very ironic. And so, we are not only well entertained, but can also learn something from it.
Please go for typing... it doesn't take long, doesn't hurt, and can save many people's lives.

1. General Information
The one-man entertainment device BATTLEZONE is equipped with a vector or X/Y monitor. This game illustrates the combat action from the perspective of a tank driver. The battles take place in a wide valley, which is completely surrounded by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley floor, there are rock pyramids and rock cubes that provide the player with temporary protection, as they cannot be destroyed by enemy fire.
The opponent is represented by slow-moving tracked vehicles and fast super tanks, as well as agile missiles, which become increasingly difficult to hit during the extended course of the game. Additionally, UFOs appear at periodic intervals. These cannot attack the player's tank. Conversely, the player can achieve a high score by hitting a UFO. The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) different operating modes. These are the attraction sequence, the game introduction sequence, the game sequence, the initials entry for high scores, and the self-test sequence. The latter mode represents a special sequence for checking the controls and computer function.
4. Course of the Game
The game sequence is triggered when the START pressure switch is pressed. The LED switch remains illuminated and the game sounds become audible. When the last player tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game ends. The game begins with slow-moving tanks that become visible on the screen. The player can determine the position of the respective enemy tanks or missiles by paying attention to the displayed text in the upper left hint display angle of his cockpit. A hint could, for example, read: ENEMY FROM THE RIGHT. In addition, a point becomes visible on the far-reaching radar screen, accompanied by a sonar BLIP sound, representing the enemy position.
The upper, cone-shaped area on the radar screen represents the player's field of view on the underlying screen. If the opponent is in this area, they can be easily targeted on the screen. Furthermore, ENEMY IN FIRE RANGE is simultaneously displayed in the upper left notification display.
Occasionally, UFOs become visible on the screen, flying over the battlefield. These are harmless flying objects that observe the battle and cannot eliminate either the enemy or the player's tank. The flight position of the UFOs cannot be detected by radar. The UFOs are meant to round off the battle action and distract the player, as they usually appear simultaneously with enemy tanks or missiles. UFOs can be eliminated by both the player's tank and the enemy's tank. A shot down by the player earns them 5,000 points. If an enemy is hit, the following points are achieved: 1,000 points for a slow-moving tank, 2,000 points for a missile, and 3,000 points for a super tank. A super tank moves and rotates twice as fast as the player's tank or an enemy's slow-moving tank. Several options give the operator the opportunity to use 2, 3, 4, or even 5 tanks in a game sequence. Furthermore, after reaching predetermined point totals, a bonus tank can be released and the appearance of the missile can be varied for a more challenging game design. Details and the exact switch positions of the game sequence selector switch for this setting option can be found in the illustration.
5. Initial input for highest results
If a player exceeds the minimum score in the high score table, he or she can enter three (3) personal initials into the table at the end of the game. The instructions for this are self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. It should be noted that triggering a self-test, pressing the RESET button on the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PCB, or interrupting the power supply will erase the high score table. When resetting, the ten (10) highest scores with their initials are preserved and re-entered on the screen to challenge further players. Any score over 100,000 is additionally marked with a tank symbol, followed by the player's initials. If a player does not enter his or her initials within 60 seconds, dashes will be automatically entered by the computer. After this, the device switches back to the attraction game mode. SETUP ARRANGEMENT
1. New Parts
The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) new components. If you already have experience with ATARI video devices, you should take note of these important differences. The new parts are: A. The control lever. This is a redesign of the ATARI shift lever. It has been reinforced with several additional ribs in the inner and outer housing part, making this assembly unit more stable and ensuring the proper function of the switch contacts. Another modification is the rubber centering bellows, which, like a centering spring, always returns the control lever to the middle position. The micro switches are now attached with self-locking nuts for easier replacement. B. Two PC boards. ATARI's X/Y game circuit has been extended to two (2) interconnected boards. These are the Analog Vector Generator and the Auxiliary Board. With the help of this circuit technology, more lines are generated on the screen at a higher speed, resulting in a smooth and steady image. C. The power supply. Battlezone is equipped with a newly designed power supply. It has a larger, more powerful transformer to cover the increased power supply provided by the expansion of the circuit. D. The device housing. Due to the new design, it was now possible to install a new cash box with a larger coin capacity. Furthermore, the device contains a console intended as a platform for smaller players to facilitate gameplay. At the same time, this console ensures maximum device stability at the installation site.
These new components, as well as all other main assemblies of this device, are shown in Figure 1. If one of these new parts is mentioned in the manual, you will find this symbol. 2. Device Inspection
After removing the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready to play. However, you should perform a certain check to complete the quality control. To be sure that the device was delivered to you in a proper condition, the following checks should be made: NOTE: Do not yet connect the device to the 220 V network. A. Examine the outside of the case for damage. B. Open the maintenance flap of the device and check the components inside the device as follows: (1) Check all cable harness connectors for correct and firm connection. Connect any open or loose connectors.
NOTE: Never forcibly make plug connections. The plugs are equipped with a forced guidance system, so that a correct connection is made. A plug connection twisted by 180 degrees will destroy the PCB.
(2) Check the plug connections to the game PC board for correct and firm fit. (3) Note the manufacturing number of the device on the type plate on the back of the device. Check whether the embossed manufacturing number matches those of the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PC board, auxiliary PC board, controller/audio II PC board, and the TV monitor. An illustration of the location of the manufacturing number can be found on the back cover of this manual. This number should always be provided when you call your dealer for further service information. (4) Check all other main components such as the power supply, the control console, and the TV monitor for proper assembly. (5) Finally, the device must be supplied with mains voltage and switched on. By looking through the player's viewing glass, check whether the radar screen is also located in the bright, orange-circled opening of the casing. If the opening is not exactly centered, the casing, which is attached with adhesive tape to the housing, must be loosened and realigned. Before the device is connected to the power supply, it must be ensured that the voltage selector plug on power supply 1 (see Fig. 3) matches the local mains voltage. Check the cable color at the plug and check the connection values as listed below:

INTRODUCTORY WORDS TO FAHRENHEIT
My desire to develop video games was sparked by the advent of 3D real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a host of new possibilities and appeared to me as a new means of expression, with which one could push the world to its limits. It represented a way for me to explore new horizons. I felt like a cinematic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century: On the one hand, I was struggling with the still immature technology, but on the other hand, I was aware that there was still everything to discover - especially a new language that had to be both narrative and visual. To be completely honest, the next ten years could not satisfy my hunger. I had the vague feeling that video games were only exploiting a tiny part of their amazing creative possibilities because they were too focused on "action" and forgot a fundamental element of human experience: sensations. Meanwhile, technology continued to make rapid progress. Fahrenheit represents my contribution to making video games a true means of conveying sensations. Even though this could have happened in a completely different form, Fahrenheit's greatest achievement is the fact that it raises real questions and offers concrete answers. Fahrenheit is proof that one can indeed create an interactive gaming experience that is not only based on fighting hideous monsters in dark corridors and shooting at crates to get ammunition, but has far more demanding and profound content. It is proof that one can both tell a story and offer game content without having to sacrifice the narrative or interactive elements. I hope that both hardcore gamers and casual players will enjoy this new gaming experience. If you are rather skeptical about video games, I hope that Fahrenheit will help change your attitude in this regard. May other developers also feel the desire to embark on this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspirations, talent, and ambition. Interactivity is still in its infancy and offers the chance to discover everything. Over the past two years, Fahrenheit has filled a large part of our lives and has been an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, in which we were repeatedly forced to question many of the principles previously considered inviolable. I would consider myself fortunate if Fahrenheit - like books, films, and songs that have left a lasting impression on you - also does not pass you by without leaving a trace. David Cage

Gameplay
By pressing the corresponding start button, the game is started for one or (with a minimum credit of 2) for 2 players. The aim is to acquire as much area as possible without crossing the path of the rotating QIX and without hitting the wandering SPARX. The game is set up in such a way that a minimum prescribed area must be occupied before you can tackle the next area (round). At the top of the screen, the time-controlled SPARX are indicated by red timing lines. When the red lines meet, additional SPARX are released. In case of an alarm, the SPARX turn into SUPER-SPARX and become more aggressive. If, while you are trying to draw your territory, your marker gets caught in the death spiral, it will be destroyed, as you cannot cross your own path or go back. If you hesitate and do not complete your area, a fuse is lit and your marker is destroyed. Two speed settings are available. With slow drawing speed, the points are doubled. After opening the control panel, the 4 programming and test switches are accessible.
The QIX game is capable of self-testing, it provides data and demonstrates that circuits and controls are working flawlessly. For more information, see "Service Program". The volume can be adjusted on the volume control (VOLUME) on the Data/Sound PC-Board.

SERVICE PROGRAM
General. The 4 switches located in the device, the self-test button, and the LEDs on the video PC board are used for programming and testing.
Programming Display. This display is used to select the language (English, French, Spanish, German) for address programming and game operation. The languages can be set using the "Sub-Test" switch. When the desired language - green - appears, press the "Test" switch to switch to the next programming display. Mission Programming. This display can be used to determine the difficulty factor for the game. It can also be used to set a "maximum number of credits" that may be present before the start of the game. The text to be changed is set by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch (appears green), the desired value for this line is programmed with the "Up" or "Down" switch. By pressing the "Sub-Test" switch multiple times, the factory or basic setting can be reached. When the bottom line (RESET line) lights up green, press the "Up" switch. The values are reset, the pointer (as the green lines are called) jumps to the first line, further programming can be done. "Test" always triggers the next program display. "Back" [Reserve High Score Value x 10,000) is used to transfer the high score points to the next program display until "High Hit Rate So Far". This value determines the required number of points/hits a player needs in order for their own initials (names) and hit points to be entered on the screen. The "maximum number of credits" sets a coin acceptance limit for the device. If the limit is exceeded, the coin acceptance is blocked - if a coin lock is present. This allows a limited number of games to be set for a player. This value ranges from 1 - 99. It should not be set so close to 99 that the credits cannot be reduced to zero by inserting a coin if more than 99 is added. A free play mode can be selected by setting "maximum credits" to 0. Further programming: "Number of games": Number of marking characters per credit.
"Threshold": The percentage number that must be reached to switch to the next round.
"Time limit": Release for additional Sparx
"Difficulty": Difficulty level of the game progression
"Sound On": no sound at "0" during standby operation
at "1" sound even in standby mode (animation sound) "table model": at "0" stationary device
at "1" table device
The credits per coin are set on the "coin slot programming" display. High-score program display ("highest hit rate so far"). The player's hit points and initials appear, including the next 10 scores. The values are used to set the high score, which were selected on the previous display (setting of "back"). By pressing the "Up" switch, the initials QIX standard are set. By pressing the "Test" switch, the next program display appears. The "total evaluation". By pressing the "Up" switch, it can be set to 0. The following values are recorded: Total credit: The number of paid credits. The total number is not set to 0. When 1,000,000 is reached, the count starts over. The total number can only appear as 0 if the battery or the W1 connector are removed, with the device turned off. Left-side coins: Number of coins inserted in the left coin slot. Middle coins: (not available) Right-side coins: Number of coins inserted in the right coin slot. Paid credits: Number of credits given for inserted (converted coins). Granted credits: Number of credits given by the device. % Free games: Granted credits (Paid + granted credits per 100) Played minutes: Number of minutes played. Won minutes: Number of minutes, in extended or won game. % Free time: Won minutes/played minutes per 100. Average game duration in sec.: Played minutes/paid + granted credits.
High Score (Hit Rate): The number of times a player had a sufficiently high hit rate to displace other players from the high score list. By pressing the "Up" button, the values are reset to 0. By pressing the "Test" button, the next program display appears.
Coin slot programming/normal money setting. With the help of this display, the operator can choose a standard coin setting or program a different setting.
If a standard setting is provided, the programming is selected by pressing the "Up" and "Down" switch while the top digit lights up green on the screen. The size values change with the change of the digit. Upon reaching the correct setting by pressing the "Test" switch, the setting is adopted. If a setting is desired that does not correspond to the standard setting, the values can be adjusted by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch. After a single press, the top adjustment number is set to 0, which means that a custom setting is possible. Since the lower values remain unchanged, the programmer can reduce his adjustment efforts by choosing a setting that is close to his desired values and only changing the values that are not suitable. As soon as the setting has been made, any new size to be set can be selected by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch. If pressed unintentionally, the standard setting appears. The values can be increased or reduced with the "Up" and "Down" switch. The process is completed by pressing the "Test" switch. The coin multiplier ("coin unit") indicates how many coin units are given for each coin inserted through an assigned slot. Coin units - "credit" shows the number of required units before a credit is issued. "Bonus" coin units show the required units before a bonus credit is issued. "Min. Coin" is a value that accumulates credits until a set minimum amount of coins is reached. In the standard setting, this value is not used "0". CMOS MEMORY (memory) FAILURE.
If "Memory Failure - Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, in which all programming is stored, has failed. All values stored in the RAM will be reset to factory default settings. This condition likely indicates a battery failure or error.
TROUBLESHOOTING and SETTINGS
Start of the test method. Press the "Sub-Test" button or the "Self-Test" button (SW 1 near the LED display). All LEDs should light up and the hardware test can begin. The tests and settings can be entered for each program display, by pressing the "Test" button the next program is displayed each time. If a continuous test of the video board is desired, the self-test button must be pressed twice to start the video test in the auto-test mode. In this program, the device will continuously perform the hardware test until it is turned off. When the "Open Coin Door to Test" display appears, the program plug J 19, 1 - 2 must be inserted. If plug J 19 is removed, the memory is protected and the CMOS RAM test video cannot be performed. Hardware tests: These tests are performed as follows: O = off / I = on / X = test results.
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each video ROM and compares it with the checksum stored for that ROM. If there is a difference, the device stops and the value of the ROM with the incorrect checksum appears on the LEDs. If the checksum ROM is faulty, U 10 is displayed first. If this test fails, the next ROM displayed on the LED display must be replaced. The E-PROM memory in a given game can be introduced as banks (series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROMs. The E-PROM type for each series is chosen by the decoding plug (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732). Communications RAM from the video board.
The Communications RAM test determines the functional reliability of the memory shared by two processors by storing predetermined series of numbers in the RAM and then checking if the storage was correct. LED value: 00 0010 If the device stops with the above display, an error has been detected. If the Communications RAM fails during the Video Board test, the error could be due to faulty wiring (RAM) or errors in the Data Board. To locate the error, remove the Data Board from P 6 and repeat the test. A failure means: errors in U 3, U 4 or associated circuits.
Video Board CMOS RAM
After values have been written into another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is checked in the same way as the Communications RAM. If the test is passed, all memory locations are set to their previous value. LED value: 00 0011 If the device stops with the above display, there is an error. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the associated circuits or the decoding.
Check the video board color RAM by storing predetermined number sequences in the color RAM. These number sequences are checked for accuracy when read back. LED value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, there is an error. Check U 56, U 57, and associated multiplexers and decoders.
Video Board (Display RAM). The display RAM is tested by writing a pattern on each side. The results of these writings are compared with the original pattern. Any discrepancy causes the program to halt and the LEDs indicate the faulty RAM. If a display RAM fails, identify the problem and replace the RAM. If this error diagnosis does not indicate a RAM failure (00 0101 on LEDs), it is indicated that the next test is being started (Data Hardware). The connection to the Data Processor must be present and it must be functional.
Unfortunately disappointed
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. That's also the reason for star number 1. The second star is for the fact that the correct jacket arrived without any noticeable seam defects. BUT I was probably too excited about this jacket, because the disappointment was all the greater. I had oriented myself based on the other reviews and ordered the jacket in size L. Since it was supposed to fit so tightly and I didn't want to struggle into a size S or M with my bust size... In the end, it would have fit in terms of length and at the hips...but the rest was too loose. Also, the lining material was already coming out when opening the package and spread everywhere. Just a shame.. It will be returned :/
Fast delivery and good workmanship
The jacket makes a great impression. We were surprised by the good craftsmanship. It can be worn well from both sides. We ordered it for our daughter, she is totally thrilled. She usually wears size 158 and in this case, size 36 fits her quite well and will surely be worn next year as well. We can recommend placing an order.
Robust Quality
I chose the rubber pad c because I always work with wood on the jack and it's not optimal. Unfortunately, I mismeasured and the pad doesn't quite fit. But that's my mistake. I slightly altered it so it fits. The pad seems very robust and the edges are no longer damaged. You can use the groove or the entire surface. It worked without any problems. Nothing slips anymore. I would buy it again immediately.
Unfortunately too big for under 1 year
The product itself is quite okay, but not for under one year. The chewing surface is too large for a small mouth. We got it when our son was 7 months old and he couldn't use it because of its size. Now at 12 months, we have taken it out again and he can use it. He hasn't been able to bite anything off with his few existing teeth. And when it has been in the refrigerator, it soothes him a lot.
Quality not sufficient / Unfortunately going back
I must have been blinded by the sometimes overly enthusiastic reviews here. I would like to preface this by saying that I already have 2 Lowepro backpacks in use. A very large one (for storing equipment) and a rather small one for the most important, everyday items that you just take with you. Because I just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the small Lowepro has now become definitively too small and I need a replacement. On Prime Day, I bought this backpack for a really very affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy about this purchase, as I had read many of the reviews in advance. But when the backpack arrived yesterday, the disillusionment followed: The backpack is not bad for under 30 EUR, you can't say that. But that it (as written in many reviews) can keep up with the well-known products, which are sold at much higher prices... guys, that's just not true! I really hoped that it was, but there can be no talk of that. The padded walls are much thinner and do not offer the same protection as my Lowepro. Even the dividers inside are of a different caliber, much flimsier. Overall, the feel of this backpack cannot be compared to my Lowepro. Also, the zippers and the materials of the compartments for the small items are not exactly high quality. Therefore, I have decided for myself that the backpack is going back. If I buy equipment worth many thousands of EUR, then I unfortunately also have to spend the money for a decent backpack. Quality apparently does have its price here. For someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money, the backpack is certainly a good choice, but not for me. And it's not like the decision was difficult for me. When I unpacked the backpack, I knew after 2 minutes that it was going back. What I did like was the color inside. Here you can certainly find your things much faster than with a gray interior. For someone who has different demands on a backpack, the backpack is certainly a great thing, but mine is going back.
Unfortunately disappointed by the third part
So far, I had liked the Electric series by E. L. Todd the most, but this book changed my opinion. I found the first two books very strong and recommendable and was really looking forward to the third part. This part is all about the feelings of Volt and Taylor and I found it unnecessarily drawn out. Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally admits everything, and then acts like a little child and sulks in every argument?! At the same time, there were also inconsistencies, in my opinion, because at the end of the second part, Volt was still trying to convince Taylor's ex and didn't believe him when he said that Taylor was into him and tried to convince the ex that Taylor couldn't be without him and that he had heard it himself. But at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and fights for Taylor. I had hoped that this was the last part of the series and think that this part is the weakest and also quite unnecessary. I will still read the fourth part and hope that it finally comes out that Taylor's friend Sarah is Volt's ex. That would bring more tension back into the story.
Humans destroy everything, appreciate nothing, and never learn! First of all: The movie is not as bad as many people say. Sure, the story is totally contrived, and always designed according to the same formula. Once you've seen the beginning, you know how it ends. And the message is always the same: Humans destroy everything, appreciate nothing, and never learn! And that's exactly what the movie wants to tell us! How often during the movie I thought (even though I know it's just a movie, and the animals are computer-generated): Oh my God, the poor animals, it often brings tears to your eyes. Therefore, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is really well made. It's just a shame that humans don't get the message behind the movie, even though it's a mainstream film. We consistently destroy animals, the environment, and ultimately our planet and ourselves. Out of greed and profit, and out of stupidity and arrogance! Empathy for the environment and living beings: none. 4 stars, because the movie is well made, but unfortunately always according to the same principle, otherwise it would have been 5 stars. Still, it's well-made popcorn cinema.
a quiet, sensitive film
Some expect a film here à la 8 Mile. This film is not a Hollywood blockbuster and doesn't want to be. This film is primarily "French" - it's also calm, sensitive, empathetic, authentic, and can bring one to tears - if one engages with it and expects nothing from it that it doesn't want to be.
Problematic
Tastes like Quench from the 90s, supposedly orange, but that doesn't really matter. 5 days, every morning a packet: nothing has changed, absolutely nothing. My waist circumference has grown by 12 cm! Bloating like never before! Then diarrhea 5-8 times a day. Not very helpful, unfortunately, despite immediate discontinuation, the diarrhea has persisted for a week. It's worth noting that the smaller packaging size only received 2 stars (unfortunately only noticed too late), while the larger one got a full 5? That's very, very strange!
Terrible smell and poor result! I dyed my blonde hair to a chocolate brown with an intense tint in October, and used this hair color remover in February/March. I applied the product twice. The first time, I immediately noticed that it smelled terrible! However, the result was not too bad, it turned out to be a chestnut brown (somewhat darker). Since I did not achieve my desired result, I used it again, as instructed in the manual for unsatisfactory results. This time it was a complete waste of time! It made no difference, my hair looked the same as after the first attempt. The worst part was, it still smelled weeks after the application.. No matter how often I washed my hair, the smell just wouldn't go away.
Highly Recommended
I have been taking the tablets for quite a long time now, always one tablet every 5 days. My vitamin levels have been low for a while due to my work, lack of exercise, and a prolonged additional illness. I wanted to boost my immune system not only through healthy eating but also by taking Vitamin D3 and K2. This is working very well. I feel fitter and much more comfortable. I sleep better and get out of bed more easily. The price is also great considering how long you can take the tablets. Absolutely recommendable.
Function not entirely flawless!!! After 3 months of using the battery case, I have discovered the following major defects which I find very disturbing: 1) Over time, the case has problems "connecting" with the phone. By this I mean that it no longer charges even though you have pressed the "Power On/Off" button for 3 seconds. Removing the phone from the case and reinstalling it solves the problem in 70% of cases, but this creates a new defect. 2) Due to frequently removing and reinstalling the phone in the case, the cover is now so worn that it detaches itself from the case, which is why I almost lost it several times. Although these are not many major defects, I believe that a battery case should function flawlessly in its function and therefore I am very disappointed with the product for the cost of 30€, especially since I have only been using it for 3 months.
Too expensive, too thin, and disappointing
I don't know how all these good reviews came about. Ultimately, it's really just a glasses cleaning cloth, which you can get as a gift from any optician in a slightly smaller form. The cleaning effect is as good as a kitchen towel and no better. I expected much more from these cloths, it is also really very, very thin. Since I have used it, I unfortunately can't return it. I am disappointed and cannot recommend it from my side. The price for these cloths is far too high, more than 2 euros should not be given.
I doubt the frequency response
I bought this speaker for the shower when my smaller free speaker, which I received as a promotional gift, unfortunately broke. Basically, the Onforu works great, is waterproof (it has already fallen into the shower), delivers bass as bass, Bluetooth works great... You obviously have to wet the suction cup, otherwise it comes off.. it can play sound very loudly... yes.. what I see critically is the frequency response of this small speaker. As I said, bass is reproduced as bass and not converted into a higher frequency. However, this causes a problem. Some frequencies are played very loudly, while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of the vocals almost hurt in the ears, higher and lower frequencies are just audible enough. My old speaker did not reproduce bass well as bass, but the frequencies were represented quite naturally in volume. Unfortunately, this is not really the case with the Onforu, which I find a bit annoying. Therefore, I have to deduct a star for that. I expected more from the frequency response.
very bad
In a few places, the paint had chipped off and if you just ran your hand over it, the paint would come off in some places as well. We wanted to have it picked up for free because we didn't want it anymore, but unfortunately only at our own expense. They would only replace the damaged parts, but how could they if both dressers were damaged. Poor service from the manufacturer. Amazon took care of everything for us and refunded our money. Kudos to Amazon.
Better to spend a little more money
The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in the quality. Individual parts are delivered which you have to glue together yourself. The product was packed in a simple envelope made of thin cardboard. There was no additional protection. Since the mailman crammed the product into my mailbox, a few stencils were damaged. I didn't complain because I urgently needed this product. The included adhesive barely holds, but it sticks well - like chewing gum that doesn't harden. Just one day after gluing, almost half of the stencils had fallen off the wooden sticks. Since the adhesive material does not dry out (at least it was still not dry 5 days after gluing), you have to be very careful not to glue everything together. The stencils are partially not fully punched out. For one-time use and as a gag for a party, it's okay, but for a wedding, I would invest a bit more money and opt for a high-quality product.
I'm not dissatisfied. The cabinet looks good and is easy to assemble, even if the instructions are not so clear. + Magnetic closures + nice appearance + stable when assembled + shelf can be positioned as desired.
- Doors slam due to magnets (this could perhaps be balanced out with rubber knobs)
- The supplied dowels are much too small and wobble (I didn't have any others and since there was no trophy in the house, I glued them with craft glue) - The brackets for the insert shelf are a bit wobbly (I wrapped them with some paper and balanced them out) Conclusion: If it didn't look so good and have such good dimensions, I would give fewer stars, as you have to make everything fit in order to be truly satisfied. Also, I find it a bit too expensive for what it is.
I like the taste of the coffee....but
...there are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, in my opinion, the original capsules are better (but also significantly more expensive). Therefore, I would have given 5 stars. Unfortunately, the coffee does not flow evenly (if at all!). Also, the additional plastic waste (individually packaged, see photo) means a star deduction for me. I hope the manufacturer changes this and soon scores full points.
Gets on my nerves
The alarm clock arrived quickly and everything is easy to set up. However, the natural sounds are terrible, and extremely loud at that. I couldn't turn them down either. Probably a defect, supposedly it should be possible. The quietest radio setting was also too loud for me, it would jolt me out of bed immediately. In addition, the dimmest display setting is so bright that you can cast shadows on the wall with your hand. I always woke up when I turned my face towards the alarm clock, because I thought it was already morning. However, when the sunrise simulation began, it was immediately too bright for me. I liked the colors and the color change, unfortunately, you can't dim the colored light. I also liked that it has a battery, so in case of a power outage, the time and alarm don't need to be reset. However, for the reasons mentioned, it was returned.
Light superb, workmanship insufficient
I have replaced four light bulbs in my house with these lamps. Unfortunately, I could only replace four, as the other two were delivered without a socket - instead, a circuit board is laughing at me at this point... There was also nothing in the box. "Pay for 6 - receive 4" is not a good deal. Surely Amazon would have handled this generously and quickly, but I only noticed this after the return period. Therefore, I see this as my mistake and live with it. Nevertheless, it is not a good indication of the quality of these light bulbs - so far the only reason for deducting two stars. The light itself is great. The rooms are now very bright and evenly lit. The light color tends more towards cool white. Perfect for hallways, offices, workshops, laundry rooms, etc. For living rooms, I would personally opt for warmer light. Comparable to a good old 100 watt bulb. However, other lamps can also do this and maybe I will get intact specimens according to the order there. If my review is helpful, I would appreciate a positive rating. I try to answer questions quickly.
Great
I have received gestures, and I would like to share my first look. Yes, positive. I thought for a long time about whether to order this set or not. **The material is sturdy and it fits well in the hand. **The utensils all have a hole in the handle so they can be hung up. **The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is particularly practical to use with coated pans. **They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440 ℉. **They also do not conduct heat, so they can be touched directly. **However, the dishwasher sometimes leaves water spots on the black silicone. But a quick wipe and they are gone. Finally, I must say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend.
B-Grade Goods Sold as New Products
Amazon Prime shipping is simply top-notch. Delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, unpacked the faucet and checked all parts. We found that the part had already been installed once before. We had to notice significant scratches and abrasions on all assembly parts. The screw connections/connections of the hoses were all damaged. Nevertheless, we installed the part in the sink (unfortunately). Only now did we see that there were also scratch marks / streaks on the chrome faucet itself. This part was probably already delivered and returned. We will keep this faucet and install it in the sink in the basement because it doesn't matter how it looks there. Our conclusion; We will never order such goods from Amazon again, but rather spend a little more in the hardware store where we get decent goods. I find it simply sad that customers are being cheated like this!!!
Product itself is top-notch, unfortunately the external sensor broke after just 6 months.
In principle, I am very satisfied with this product. The installation was very straightforward, and the range is also very good, with no problems with transmission from inside to outside. I also find the design of the device appealing. It is very simple and can be either mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use, the device that measures the outside values seems to be broken. However, the thermometer still seems to be intact, as it continues to display plausible values. The hygrometer, on the other hand, seems to be broken, as it constantly displays completely astronomical values of outside humidity. This is very unfortunate, as the device was installed outside in a protected location and is also the reason why I only give this product two stars.
Powerful mower with weak collection bag
Aside from the fact that the first delivery attempt is still cheerfully traveling around the republic with Hermes as of today, without finding its way to me or back to Amazon, the service from Amazon with the triggering of a replacement delivery was, as always, excellent. The mower arrived quickly and made a high-quality impression. The engine is powerful and it produces a nice cut. The volume is not impressively low, but okay. The big drawback, unfortunately, is the grass catcher. For one, it is only made of hard plastic at the top and bottom, with fabric in between. If you set it down briefly when it's full, it naturally gets compressed and parts of the contents fall out. Worse, however, is that the otherwise practical fill level indicator turns red when the grass catcher is only half full. This wouldn't be so bad if the mower didn't start losing large parts of the cuttings from that point on. Emptying the catcher on a large lawn area when it's only half full can't be the solution. Therefore, I cleaned the device as best I could and sent it back. Conclusion: Basically a very good mower, but the unfortunate design of the grass catcher makes it unusable for me.
Good device for monitoring
I have two of these devices. The device can be easily integrated via the app. The included plug-in sensor cable, which can be extended if necessary, is very good. The device is solidly built. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but to conserve the battery, they are only displayed once to three times a day (adjustable) in the app. I am giving only 4 stars for the following reasons. - The soft back of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, is quite fiddly to close again. - One of the two devices is in a room with quite thick walls. This device loses connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device does not reconnect itself, even if you place it near the router. You have to remove the batteries and reinsert them after a short break, then it reconnects. This should actually work without removing the battery. There is always an alarm when the connection is lost. - The alarm tone could be a bit louder.
3D Printer Prusa i3 DIY
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I have not been able to level the hotbed correctly to this day. The right rear locking screw is fully tightened, yet the hotbed is still too high there, and the screw on the front right is practically falling out because it is not tightened at all, even though the hotbed is still too low. The rods that hold the carriage are straight, as is the table. Maybe someone knows what can be done, because it is impossible to print anything like this. Regarding the assembly: The assembly was quite trouble-free, it would just be helpful to show how to lay the cables because otherwise, you have to re-lay them several times, which is very strenuous. I have already written to support, but after a week of waiting, I still have not received a response. Unfortunately, returning it is no longer an option. I had expected a bit more.
robust and precise, I am positively surprised
My old caliper unfortunately gave up the ghost after many years, so I needed a new one. This one here seems very robust and is just as precise after several test measurements. It comes with two batteries, so you can get started right away. The packaging of the caliper is simple, but it fully serves its purpose. Otherwise, the caliper leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measuring methods. I can only give it full marks and believe it will last at least as long as the old caliper. I give a clear buying recommendation and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household.
Disgusting, persistent smell
I bought the bracelet and initially did not wear it, as it emitted a disgusting smell. To this day, the smell has not gone away, even though it was constantly "aired out". Since a return was no longer possible, I disposed of it. I advise against purchasing it.
Okay for the price
The stars and balls on this chain are personally a bit too large for me, making it look quite bulky. The larger balls are freely movable, which I find quite nice. However, the chain is overall very simply made, so I have already torn the clasp twice. So far, I have always been able to repair it, but I think that it will not last/hold up for long. But for the low price, you simply cannot expect anything really high-quality.
Very beautiful piece of jewelry
A beautifully crafted bracelet - and the simple clasp actually holds! You just have to pull the end through the mouth, it can't come undone, amazing! I rubbed it with some leather care, which makes it even softer and more supple. Just a note: if you have something magnetic on your arm: The clasp is made of steel!
Unfortunately, it's junk! I was already disappointed after unpacking it, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, giving me the feeling that it was used goods. The base station was fine. Now to the function: It only connects after some fiddling around... if you follow the instructions, it doesn't work at all, only after I removed a battery from the base station and inserted a new one, did the transmitters finally connect. Unfortunately, my joy about this did not last long, because after just one hour the connection was gone again, even though the transmitters were next to the base station. Also, the display of the three transmitters was very different! All in all, it's not usable for me! The thing went back! I would definitely advise against buying it, it only brings trouble!
Transport Damage
Hello, I had this garden pump once before, unfortunately after 3.5 years the thread of the internal shaft had rusted. I bought it again for one reason only, I urgently needed it due to the current drought and I knew the connections of the suction line and the discharge would fit. I hope that the shaft of the previous pump had a production error and the current pump lasts a bit longer. Unfortunately, the new pump had transport damage, the plastic housing was cracked and the ventilation slots were broken. The box was also damaged from the outside, so I would recommend packaging the pump a bit better in the future, rather than just using a thin-walled box. I kept the pump anyway, as described above, I urgently needed the pump and the cracks in the plastic housing did not affect the pump performance.
This could have been better thought out. As I often deal with many different keys, I thought such an organizer would be more convenient than constantly carrying around a huge bunch of keys. At first, everything went quite well. However, the paint quickly started to peel off and the screws had to be constantly tightened. It's nice that this can be done with a cent coin, but only with a cent coin. I couldn't find a suitable flathead screwdriver that wouldn't have immediately ruined the entire screw. Now to the most annoying part of the whole thing: attaching the keys. It's nice that you can adjust the screw to different sizes or lengths using the various parts, but once you've screwed everything together, you need pliers to take it all apart again. Attaching the keys themselves is simply a game of patience, balance, and skill. Ultimately, the screw broke off in the thread the third time I assembled it, rendering the entire thing useless. Conclusion: If at all, then only for once all necessary keys and then never again, but at this price, you can also buy a cheaper alternative.
Do not quite match the specified dimensions
The zippers are easy to use, the material seems robust, and all of this is lightweight. Since I have no comparison (this is my first organizer set), I will only be able to truly assess the product after its first use. I can already say that the height is less than stated. At the moment, I can't really imagine packing everything for a three-week vacation in there. If necessary, the really large items can go directly into the suitcase - as before. It should be noted that not 8, but 10 pieces were delivered, as there were two smaller bags/pouches included in the round cosmetic bag. Not high-quality workmanship, but I wanted to mention it anyway. The fact that the cosmetic bag has a different color and is made of a different material than the other bags doesn't bother me personally. I see the price-performance ratio as a trial price and that's okay.
So-so
So, I ordered it before Christmas and it worked until after Christmas. Now, when I wanted to use it again, it no longer worked. Battery? Replaced. But it still doesn't work. So, I might as well have thrown the money directly into the trash can.
Care is always good! The application is simple, but one should be very careful with the brush to avoid damaging the needle. I could not discern an improvement in sound on my very high-quality record player.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. Included were two black cables. The battery life lasts a very long time. Definitely completely sufficient sound. I liked that the headphones do not hurt even after long wear and are therefore very comfortable. The ear cups are totally soft and pleasant to wear. The weight is also kept very low. Purchase recommendation in this price range.
stylish dress
Very beautiful dress, which is suitable for a variety of occasions. The price-performance ratio is completely right here, especially since I also bought it in a flash sale. It fits perfectly in my size, I'm glad I didn't order it smaller (as was recommended). I just wish the neckline wasn't so deep, and the sleeves could use a bit more fabric (if you don't have quite as slim upper arms as the model in the picture). But all in all, a chic dress for many occasions.
Stay away. It can't get any worse. I really and seriously did not expect such junk to be sold these days. The drive is operated on a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop. It can be assumed that the USB ports provide sufficient power. Nevertheless, this drive cannot operate without interference. DVDs usually work, Blu-rays are recognized at best unreliably. The discs have to be inserted several times, after which it makes grinding noises like those not heard since the 90s from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives. After minutes, you can either restart the computer because it's not getting any better, or the disc is finally recognized. But then you must not press pause, skip to a chapter, change the language during the movie, or do anything at all. This immediately leads to an irreparable freeze. In addition, of course, no Blu-ray software is included. If you buy PowerDVD or similar for an additional fee, the price of this drive doubles.
It does what it's supposed to do, but it's not pretty. First and foremost, I want to point out that the two USB ports are somewhat deceptive, as only the port that points upwards is a USB port. The other plug is just for charging various devices and is therefore relatively useless. I didn't know this when I bought it, which is why I was a bit disappointed. I actually needed a second port and if I had just needed a simple extension, I certainly wouldn't have bought this misshapen lump with golden plugs. But aside from the aesthetics and my misjudgment, the extension does its job very reliably. And due to the weight of the plug, the inserted USB stick doesn't just dangle around like it would with a normal extension cord. So it's not a complete waste of money, but my enthusiasm is somewhat limited :-).
Small but mighty! I bought this product so that I could have an audio output on my iPad (Pro) and connect a display. With IOS 12, you can now also transfer data back and forth. This works very well. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Other adapters, which I had to send back, unfortunately could not do this. The HDMI output is practical. I now have a PS4 controller connected to the tablet via BT and the HDMI on the TV. Simultaneous charging is not a problem. Sound is delivered via HDMI. What do I still use my PlayStation for :P A small adapter was included, which can be attached to the tablet. This is supposed to provide stability and also has a magnetic holder. It doesn't fit with my case and the adapter. Well, it still holds securely and has contact, so... All in all, it's a bit expensive but justified by the full range of functions. Plus, it's very small and sturdily made from a piece of aluminum. The price-performance ratio is right.
Plenty of performance
Top device. It has been running for months without any problems. It's not exactly light or quiet, but it delivers a lot of power. I find the medium temperature setting (Tp setting) a bit too cool, so I always use it on level 2. It has also fallen on the tiled floor several times and has survived well. And I also like the simple design. Competing products often look like spaceships.
Very good
The processing of the brush head has left a very good impression, even though the price difference compared to the original is quite large, but does not make a favorable impression. In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed. Overall, I found these brushes to be very good and can be recommended without reservation.
Great product with weak battery
We have had the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised. In live mode, the location is accurate to about 0.5m. In offline mode, when the dog is in the house, it does jump a few meters, but this is not disturbing. I would buy it again anytime. However, it would be great if the battery lasted longer. Currently, it lasts about 1.5 days. A solution that would last 7-14 days would be great. There is an XL version, but unfortunately, it is too big for our taste, our battery doesn't need to last that long and we find changing it daily impractical. You should be spending time with your dog, not with its collar :-). The app also works perfectly.
After a few weeks of garbage
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They fit well and seem to be comfortable. However, their lifespan is increasingly diminishing. Even though my son only wears the shoes for physical education, the soles break after just a few weeks and the shoes can no longer be used. The last pair also didn't last very long with normal use, but I thought they would suffice for class. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The shoes are expensive trash and absolutely not recommended.
Fits perfectly - but original? Unfortunately, my last pair of Crocs broke after 5 years, so I happily ordered a new pair. These, however, seem poorly made at first glance. They are just as comfortable as the ones I previously owned. At first glance, there seems to be no difference, but upon closer inspection, you can see that the edges are poorly finished and the heel strap is quite loose and will likely not last five years like my previous ones. I'm curious to see!
Surprisingly good
Since there are hardly any reviews to read here, I was initially very skeptical. However, since I am going to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I ordered it on good luck. The delivery included the mattress and a car air pump. About the mattress: I test-fitted it in the car (Citroen Berlingo). I noticed that there is some mold on one side. I wiped it off and hope that it does not reappear. A lying test was carried out in the inflated state. It is comfortable to lie on and is perfect for the festival. Of course, this mattress cannot replace your own bed, but for days at the event, it is pure luxury. The mattress fits wonderfully into my car. We removed the seats in the back beforehand. So it fits perfectly. The air pump: The air pump has different adapters. The mattress requires two different adapters, which can also be found on the pump. The pump is plugged into the car's cigarette lighter. However, the plug was defective (something at the soldering point). Since my boyfriend is handy, he was able to repair it and once reassembled, the good part worked excellently and inflated the mattress in no time. Overall, I am very excited about the mattress. I am looking forward to the stress test at the festival. I hope that it does not lose air and lasts a long time. Also, that the mold does not reappear. After the test, I can definitely recommend it. If I should have other experiences, I will revise the review accordingly (if possible).
Definitely not worth more than 10€... Unfortunately, I can only give the calendar two stars. :( 1. For the fast shipping. 2. For the idea of the toy. Unfortunately, the calendar ripped open on day 1 due to the shoddy workmanship, across several doors. By the 21st door, there were no doors left and I had to more or less allow my son to take out the remaining parts as they were practically falling out. The parts often come out mixed up which often means that you have to disassemble the car to attach the parts. Once the car is fully assembled, parts fall off during play. (Mostly the windshield. This is also very difficult to reattach.) I would not buy this calendar again and would not recommend it to anyone. Perhaps the manufacturers will reconsider the way they have designed the calendar for the next edition and do it better. :\
a real drone
I am thrilled with the drone. My 7-year-old daughter flies it. It flies very well indoors and the 5 minutes of flight time are usually more than enough. I expected that hair would get stuck in it and the drone would break very quickly given the price, but falls from the ceiling to the floor, whether tiles or carpet, are not a problem. The contact was nice when I had questions.
The game is okay, but it can only be played with mandatory use of Steam. When I bought it, I didn't notice that it wasn't a game CD, but just a code to download the game. That would be fine, but you are forced to install Steam to be able to play it at all, which is outrageous. Since then, my computer has been constantly freezing, which certainly wouldn't be the case with a simple installation of the game.
Unfortunately, it fails due to the battery life.
I was really looking forward to the watch. The design and appearance were great, messages etc. were displayed without any problems. The operation went well... and yet I am sending it back. The big catch: the battery and its lifespan. Charged in the evening, just lying on the shelf overnight and in the morning 11% less battery despite not being used. If many messages came during the day, the battery was already depleted by noon / early afternoon and then you can't even read the time anymore. Therefore, it's not useful for me. Very unfortunate.
Noble cover with limitations
For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+, one should definitely get a case. I have recently liked cases in which you can also insert a credit card. This case offers that. If you insert cards into all 3 compartments, it becomes too much, then the cover stands a bit high. One is enough for me. The leather case makes a robust impression and seems to be well made. It looks classy. The phone is embedded all around, unlike many other cases, with only cutouts at the connections. Otherwise, you can easily operate the on-off switch and volume control on the sides through the case. The disadvantage is that it is not possible to charge the phone on some QI chargers due to the thickness of the case. Even on the QI charging station made of leather by TORRO, it doesn't work. Accessories - like the Galaxy Buds - can therefore only be charged when the case is off. Otherwise, it's really chic and well made!
high-quality case with tempered glass film
A robust case with a proper armored glass for screen protection in a classic design provides all-around protection for the entire iPhone 11. It fits very well and can also be easily applied. The material is comfortable in the hand and does not get dirty. A truly successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio. This case gives the phone some grip. It is not too bulky and fits snugly on the phone. Overall, a good purchase.
