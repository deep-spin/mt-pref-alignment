The American Gymnastics Federation supports the letter of the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute necessity for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the statement from the USOC (United States Olympic Committee) that the interests of our athletes and clubs, as well as their sport, could be better served by moving forward and making significant changes within our organization, rather than revoking accreditation.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could shed light on how the abuse of the proportion described so courageously by the survivors of Larry Nassar could have gone unnoticed for so long and adopts any necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal: to make gymnastics, as well as other sports, as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowering environment.
Throughout the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as an advisor, and then for the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already very widespread, but provides details that fossils usually cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on top and pale or carotenoid in color on the bottom.
This discovery also helps to better understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed shaft, called a rachis, but do show other feather-like features - barbs and barbules - researchers have inferred that the rachis was likely an evolutionary development subsequent to these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that, even if it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not the down of a chick.
Scientists clarify that it is indeed the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals a plumage belonging to an adult individual, not a young one.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other people.

They found that the Sun operated according to the same basic principles as other stars. The activity of all the stars in the system is determined by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
Brightness and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flow.
Regarding magnetic inversions, the smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star.

The work done was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
According to this theory, the majority of dark matter around a galaxy is located in a sort of halo, and is made up of a large number of small particles.

"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of the large caves on the planet that maintain a constant temperature, but they are similar in that they are deep holes in the ground," according to Glen Cushing, a member of the crew of the USGS (American Center for Geological Studies) and staff of the University of Arizona North located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters go into a booth, put a pre-printed piece of paper in an envelope indicating the candidate of their choice.
After the agents have checked his identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs his voter card.
The French electoral code regulates operations quite strictly.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are present at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added, except those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to attend each stage of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under high surveillance, according to specific procedures.

She first participated in the slalom, where she obtained a "did not finish" (DNF) in her first race. 36 of the 116 competitors obtained the same result in this race.
Her other race, the giant slalom, allowed her to finish in tenth place in the group of sitting women with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes less than the Austrian Claudia Loesch, who came first, and 1:09.02 minutes less than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who came ninth.
In the category of women in sitting skiing, four skiers were unable to finish their course; in the giant slalom, 45 skiers out of a total of 117 in this race were unable to place.
The Madhya Pradesh police have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said, "We have arrested five people for violating the Swiss national, and we have recovered her phone and laptop."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, a police commissioner, said that the accused had their faces covered when they appeared in court.
Although three people were present in the house when the car hit it, none were injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured to the head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily blocked to allow the emergency services to extract the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son by the Sheriff Court in Edinburgh.
She is in custody awaiting her indictment and trial, but eyewitness testimony could be compromised because her portrait has been widely circulated.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts considered that the publication of photos was potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, from the University of Dundee, notes that "journalists seem to be following a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc. of suspects".
The Crown Prosecutor's Office, which is in charge of all prosecutions, told journalists that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will focus on the border dispute that Palestine claims on the basis of the existing borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics discussed include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only agrees to a period of five years.
The shooters in the additional trial of parasite control were closely monitored by rangers, as the trial was controlled and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers have been recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting head of park and heritage conservation at NPWS, the four shooters designated for the first culling campaign have been properly trained and briefed on safety procedures.
Martelly inaugurated a new provisional electoral council (CEP) composed of nine members yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth PEC in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP as part of a set of measures aimed at putting the country on the path to new elections.
This commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which were due to take place in 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of defective iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been made aware of 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "non-serious".
The ministry reacted by calling the postponement of the report by Apple "truly regrettable".
The earthquake hit the Mariana Islands at 7:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Emergency Management Office of the Northern Mariana Islands reported that no damage had been reported in that country.
Furthermore, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and the death of at least six of them has been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released prematurely, as were the Philippine photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career as a doctor.
He trained as an obstetrician, and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births in his spare time.
His research has shown that if a hormone is administered, it would accelerate the baby's pulmonary maturation.
The Xinhua agency reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders (or "black boxes") on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. A unique moment, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as weird as me... maybe even more... I love her and I'm going to miss her... I hope she rests in a better place."
A survey of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election found that the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those surveyed share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch to reign over Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of those surveyed think that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was called into question due to his complaints.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome his pain, as it was banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water supply for the earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and promote life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and more specifically how the Earth formed, since comets collided with it a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors "gossip and political nonsense."
It is believed that he will run for president in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, limiting carbon emissions.
It relies on satellite technologies, rather than the ground-based radar systems used previously, which allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more detailed information.
There is no additional transport and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and park and ride facilities are not available on the ground.
The fear of a lack of transport has led to the possibility that the match could be played behind closed doors, without the teams' supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the genesis of a new species of bird in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have indicated that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was estimated to be much longer, following reproduction between an endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant conical-billed finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in many ways. It can be rolled into tiny pieces
It can be drawn into fine wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and glued onto another metal. It can be so thin that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is what is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of the cabbage juice changes depending on the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) present in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electron (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then, with clean and damp hands, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will induce a strange sensation and produce a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with a flush in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mingled.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and then sends it back to Earth, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket over 30 meters tall to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The greatest advantage it has brought us is that it has made transport much simpler and faster.
This has brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and other deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) that eat the much more numerous small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a special task assigned to each feline, preventing them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
The packs are made up of one to three related adult males, as well as about thirty females and cubs.
Women are usually very close to each other, their family consisting of a large number of sisters and daughters.
Lion troops act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in their behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (but sometimes with difficulty), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a powerful human.
The tiger is part of the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger does not resemble the full-throated roar of the lion, but rather a sentence in which the words would be cries and growls.
Ocelots are fond of small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
According to scientists, ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by smell, sniffing out their trail on the ground.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their environment before pouncing on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily return), it often finds itself in a different environment from the one in which it was previously.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need new characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what it needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be considered as belonging to the same species.
We call this process “speciation”, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e. breathe out).
Plants produce their food using the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosasaur was the superpredator of the time, it feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, as well as an additional set of teeth in the palate, so that anything that crossed its path could not escape.
We're not sure, but it's possible that he had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it's even possible that he was a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur such as a T. rex was no match for it.
Although the Romans ate food that we know, they ate some strange or unusual festive dishes, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and the loir, a kind of rodent.
Another difference: while the poor and the woman ate their food while sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to organize banquets together where they rested on their side while they ate.
Roman meals from antiquity could not include these American or Asian foods that were introduced to Europe centuries later.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's dwelling place.
People made sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had an open courtyard, followed by an inner sanctuary that only priests could access.
Some pyramidal towers, ziggurats, were sometimes built as elements of a temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were just open counters facing the street. The houses were built of stone.
Since there were no large forests in the land of Canaan, wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Scandinavian sagas, it is told that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and found Greenland - and named it so - by traveling further west.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country is "Scandinavian", there are many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie Benjamin Gates and the Treasure of the Templars, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776" could be read. The text is at the bottom of the document, in reverse.
Although no one really knows who wrote it, we do know that at an early stage in its existence, the large parchment (which measures about 29 and three quarters inches by 24 inches) was stored rolled up.
It is therefore likely that the notation was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles freed northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was governed by the French of Vichy, French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupier instead of confronting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in the south of France, an invasion called Operation "Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces had liberated the south of France and were heading towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The term "civilization" is derived from the Latin word "civilis", which means civil and is related to the Latin words "civis", which means citizen, and "civitas", which means large city or city-state and also indicates, in a way, the size of the society to which it refers.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and equal distribution.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - the Congress being its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes and, as there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce all its acts.
He also did not have the power to derogate from tax laws or those on customs duties between states.
Articles required the unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended, and states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German national team, the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands that make it up, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipelago".
The first information about Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, while European navigators passing through mentioned it under the name of Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing a transformation of the indigenous practices of grain production and employing Chinese workers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Hall of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings adjacent to the complex have been rebuilt in order to offer tourists a better glimpse of their original appearance.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photography format in the world is 35 mm; it was the most widespread film format at the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but what is important is that its image format is inherited from the format of the photographic sensor of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, and this is quite confusing, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
So the aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest of integer ratios) is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS family of formats) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The third-party rule, which is often mistreated and ridiculed, is a simple directive that promotes dynamism while offering protection to the image.
It indicates that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was called into question.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has linked the European states together despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power touched everyone, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over 1000 years and this concentration of power and money led many people to wonder if this doctrine was being respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain imposed a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from venturing into entire maritime areas, thus posing a threat even to neutral ships.
As this tactic only elicited a timid response, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations showed a penchant for pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to prevent such a situation from happening in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred dollars to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing the different eras; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also an unstable age of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period which took place for 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these periods, fierce struggles took place between many members of the nobility who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in Chinese history. Thousands of people died in battle to sit on the throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political repercussions such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
Also, after the Revolution, the trades were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same goes for the army, because the ranking of armies is no longer based on class, but on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that went beyond the scope of this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became famous under the name of "Hira'" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived to this day, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it's not easy at all to find, even if you know it exists. When you enter the cave, you are completely isolated.
Above, one can contemplate nothing but the clear and magnificent sky and the numerous surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave, one can see or hear very little of this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many giant structures erected in honor of the deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, includes several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the most impressive), several small tombs, numerous temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many small pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
The "push" symbol looks like a V and the "pull" symbol looks like a staple or a square with the bottom side missing.
The top means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and the bottom means you should start at the nock (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A bow upwards usually produces a softer sound, while a bow downwards is louder and more assertive.
Feel free to write your own brands in pencil, but remember that printed bow brands are printed for a musical reason, so they should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of vendors.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and threatened the king and queen.
The king and queen were forced, because of the crowd, to open the windows of their carriages.
At one point, a member of the crowd brandished the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles before the terrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in conquering the Philippines were paid by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking establishments.
Naturally, the superprofits resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Philippine people could constitute the fundamental advantages of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
These events took place in the period generally considered as the High Middle Ages – a period of European history from the 11th to the 13th century (1000-1300).
The Central Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense in which the fate of humanity is dictated by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself occurs according to a process that largely transcends cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on societies intrinsically rather than socially.
For example, one could say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The massive possession of cars also leads to a greater incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of healthcare to treat bodily injuries.
Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
According to Romanticism theories, geography would have shaped individuals and, over time, customs and a culture linked to this geography would have appeared. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to laws imposed arbitrarily.
In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of contemporary world fashion, Constantinople was considered the capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around the year 400 and lasted until around 1100.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders returned laden with gifts such as silk and spices, with which the Byzantine markets could hardly compete.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture, to the east.
However, due to the slowness of communication methods, Western fashions could be up to 25 to 30 years behind.
During the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons for fastening clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, using preserved seeds from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnic origin, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashions, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood.
These children are considered "ferocious" or wild. Some wild children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the parents' rejection of a serious intellectual or physical disability suffered by the child.
Feral children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in nature.
When raised entirely by non-human species, feral children display behaviors (within the limits of their physical abilities) almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, the support goes further.
Support is not a method of learning but rather a way of helping learners who are discovering new teaching such as the use of a new program or the start of a new project.
Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little trombone man from Microsoft Office is one too.
Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is intended to question, guide, and explain procedures that might have been too difficult for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster families for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, to extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring, and educational, but that is the case.
We see the family placement system as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the approach to uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are considered to be major factors promoting the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuing relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to major discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, that is, facial expressions lasting a few milliseconds.
It is claimed, in particular, that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, indicated how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior can be found in animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination alternate the variations between the two pools with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
Furthermore, a lack of response has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal-based food (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all the vital amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your sleep period and falling back asleep shortly after (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, so that you can regain consciousness without waking up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorythmic-based possibilities include drinking a lot of fluids before going to bed (especially water or tea, which are known to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace of a person is opposed to the degree of tension in his body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force present. Every person has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of Mahayana love and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deity. It is through the visualization of different deities that the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras activated, and the awakened consciousness created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, deep conflicts between their different systems, methods, and cultures ended the agreement between these two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would see real confrontations, through proxy armies, on battlefields in both Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, as well as other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The job of the marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and goods, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, where the Americans were trying to get soldiers and equipment across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using U-Boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Great Britain as it did for the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them close to them for easy access to milk, fur, meat, and skins.
Domestic goats were usually kept in flocks that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goatherds who were most often children or teenagers, similar to the more well-known term of shepherds. These pastoral methods are still in use today.
"Wagonways" were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the tracks for wagons were simply made up of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses that pulled them to reach higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly more rugged roads of the day.
The crossbars were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more effective if they were equipped with an iron strip on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared.
The very first means of locomotion was walking: humans started walking upright two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus (“upright man”).
Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedal specializations are found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign to mitigate the suffering to come.
In many cases, it is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want just a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot thanks to the scientific and technological progress made by humans, and that problems have become more important due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to the printing office of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, today known as the "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap sheets that are still known to exist are the oldest copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive. They are called birds.
Few people consider them to be dinosaurs, given that they have wings and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble a dinosaur.
They have scales on their legs and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on manipulating information that is encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits, or bits to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this poison.
The term "insect" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term comes from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects that are very well adapted to parasitize humans.
Reduviidae, like bed bugs, are nest-dwelling, meaning they are adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young people and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may very well feel that it is not in their interest, nor in that of the child, to take care of the education of a baby.
These couples may choose to pursue an adoption project for their baby.
In the context of an adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which actually guides most scientific research.
However, it is not the only one, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, but it also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, particularly the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's opinions on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a cycle of operation for a certain period, even in the absence of external stimulation.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments to label either the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the extent of the affected part of the genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations of germ cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is of interest to people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, particularly the fauna and flora.
Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits, and studying ecosystem information are examples of on-site activities.
For example, you can go to see, photograph and discover the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns by car to go to work and cross paths with other people who are going to work in the countryside they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system based on private cars and supports it.
Science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has disrupted the biosphere from its state of stability that has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, why do they break down every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and private vehicles between two points, and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonably consistent range, so traffic flows tend to be reasonably consistent and can be represented mathematically in an approximate way.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) the flow rate, (2) the density, and (3) the speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly allowed them to escape more easily from their enemies and to find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them a greater number of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
A few thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the volume of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on the planet, sometimes reaching 10 km wide.
No less than 20% of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main branch of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza have never been surpassed in size and the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated.
The Vatican City drafts its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have been familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, as they occur in nature in their raw form and are fairly simple to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was rather the four states of matter (in the same order) : solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also put forward the theory that these latter transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that include a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the emergence of new modes of writing has relegated the pen to a more confidential status and to rarer uses.
People now write messages on computer screens, without ever having to get near a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when the next new thing arrives.
The fission bomb works on the following principle: it transforms energy by assembling a nucleus of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
It's a bit like trying to climb a hill with a heavy cart. By dividing the nucleus again, and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, so they tend to break apart with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible side and 100 km on the hidden side.
It is thinner over the seas and thicker under the continents.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what makes people feel good or attracted.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what drives some people to want the things they do and what, in their environment, drives them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "the good friend."
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting evaluations, delegating responsibilities, and holding others accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he/she must change everything that the group has created so far and do things his/her own way.
After all, the coach is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member is accountable. It sets the standards for each of them.
Why would an organization want to impose the tedious process of creating a learning structure? One of the objectives related to the implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional services of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can fully express themselves.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer's need.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and its own culture of learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provides material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus reducing the scope of research and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of damage, injuries, tumors, and brain trauma affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly associated with science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer sciences that study the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
The research in artificial intelligence aims to automate tasks that require an intelligent approach by machines.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and recognition of writing, voice and face.
These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions to everyday problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has been implemented in several home computer software and video games.
Field trips are an integral part of any school class. Often, a teacher would like to take their students to places where a bus trip is not feasible.
The solution is provided by technology in the form of virtual educational outings. Students can look at ancient objects in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful work of art while sitting with their class.
Practically participating in an excursion is also an excellent way to reflect on a journey and share your experiences with future generations.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year dedicated to their visit to the state capital. Every year, the site is updated, but the old versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogging can also help students improve their writing skills. Even if students often try the blogging experience with neglected grammar and spelling, having an audience usually makes things evolve.
As students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogging "forces students to become more aware of the world around them." The need to generate public interest encourages students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
"When used appropriately, blogs can help students develop their analytical skills and critical thinking: by actively responding to online content, they can compare their opinions to those of others and express their own views on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada and has a large number of art galleries and museums that highlight the past and present of Canada.
You will find the Niagara Falls to the south and the Muskoka region and its surroundings to the north, which have a pristine natural beauty.
All of these measures, and many more, make Ontario what foreigners consider the quintessence of Canada.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited in the wild.
For a population comparison that surprises more than one: There are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even a continent in its own right, when it comes to fauna.
Most of the small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known for being luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought the practice of Islam to the land and this religion spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered the Cape route that connects Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
To women: It is recommended that any woman who travels say that she is married, regardless of her marital status.
It is also advisable to wear a wedding ring (which should not appear too precious.
Women need to realize that some cultural differences can lead to behaviors that they consider harassment, such as being followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting advances from men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who had rebuilt it after destroying it and named it Casa Branca, finally abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco to shop.
Around the old medina, it is easy to find places to buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and all sorts of trinkets, but that's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano which buried most of the city's streets, particularly the downtown area.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside of Goma should be researched to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking treks in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get around in Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for distant and exotic countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stages of the show “Wonders of the African World” by Henry Louis Gates on PBS.
The city is in sharp contrast to the cities in the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab than African style.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The total area of the park is 19,500 km², which is divided into 14 ecozones, each of which is home to a specific fauna.
It is one of the most well-known amusement parks in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily entrance and conservation fees for the park.
It can be advantageous to obtain a Wild Card that gives access to certain parks in South Africa, as well as to all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and represents the main center of interest for many tourists.
The row of buildings that outlines the horizon of Hong Kong has been compared to a shimmering bar graph, which is reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To admire the most beautiful panoramas of Hong Kong, leave the island and join the Kowloon waterfront located across the way.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the reclaimed land on the north shore.
This is the place that the British colonists invested in, so it seems to me to be a good starting point if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, forests are not only composed of mangrove swamps: they also contain some of the last vestiges of the majestic jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about a third is covered with water/marsh areas.
Sundarbans has been a nature reserve since 1966, and you can find about 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer there.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (located on the other side) throughout the day, but most, particularly those serving the east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 in the morning.
Inter-district buses are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese caboteurs, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to nearby places such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters; it is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the largest indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing subsistence agriculture.
Other indigenous tribes that populated the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú or the Payaguá, survived mainly thanks to fishing, hunting, or gathering.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, once known as "the giant province of the Indies", was born from the meeting between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous populations.
The Spanish inaugurated the period of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and among the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
In addition, tournaments and matches of lesser importance are sometimes organized here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and places to buy tickets for polo matches, visit the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to one pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is a commonly accepted currency throughout the islands, while in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the surrounding islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currencies may be. Speak to the owners in advance to agree on a method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange it before leaving the islands.
Montevideo is located south of the Equator, so winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone and summer temperatures exceeding 30 °C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
There are not really "rainy" and "dry" seasons: precipitation is more or less constant throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to seeing humans, they are still wild species; please do not feed or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, you must stay at least 100 metres away from bears and wolves and 25 metres away from all other wild animals!
As docile as they may seem, the bison, the elk, the moose, the bear, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking odorous foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, with the exception of a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
The supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful rally in the city, during the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement.
There are many beaches, as Auckland straddles two harbours. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the chic suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches, sometimes very popular with families, have many shops along the coast. Swimming is safe there.
The main local beer is "Number One", a fairly ordinary but tasty and refreshing beer. There is also another local beer, "Manta".
There are many French wines to taste, but New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
You can drink the local tap water without danger, but you can easily find bottled water if you have concerns about it.
For Australians, the idea of a "café crème" is foreign. A short black is an "espresso", the cappuccino is filled with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is in line with Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Numerous trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries due to one of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, north of 1770, box jellyfish arrive near beaches and river estuaries. They can also sometimes be seen outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and would stay away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their main habitat is found in the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind knowing that they will have a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation, such as camping sites, through travel agencies.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or even packages that combine flight and accommodation.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other necessary documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any changes or requests must be addressed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of attendees decide to camp on site, and most consider it an integral part of the experience.
If you want to get up close and personal with the music event, you'll need to arrive early to find a well-placed camping spot.
Remember that even if the musical shows are over on the main stages, other musical shows can continue until late at night on other festival sites.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, be sure to check the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice can cause unbearable noise levels in the most exposed cabins.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money spent by customers. There are rarely windows and clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and keep them on the premises.
At some sites, it is the locals who offer free alcoholic drinks. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know that it is crucial to remain sober.
Anyone driving to high latitudes or crossing mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, it can snow enough to block you in a very short time.
Visibility can also be limited by snow or dust storms, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and traffic is practically uninterrupted all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most memorable moment for many visitors.
In everyday language, the term "safari" refers to an excursion on African soil, and in particular in the savannah, with the aim of witnessing the striking spectacle of wild animals in their natural habitat.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars and the standard equipment allows for good observation.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "bush walk", "walking safari" or "footing") consists of hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled to take place.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with typical tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
By ironing wet clothes, you can dry them more easily. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that can be borrowed, even if there is not one in the rooms.
If you don't have an iron or don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if you can find one.
Avoid overheating the fabric (which can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, it is enough to boil the water for one minute; in others, it must be boiled for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have a concern, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter harmful animals that they are not familiar with in their home region.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritation, or, in the most severe cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are generally not considered parasites.
In some locations, duty-free shops offer an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, frequently passing through isolated backcountry terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep an open mind: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and tight curves are the norm.
The speed limits posted are significantly lower than on the previous and following stretches – usually 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to them is even more important than before.
On the other hand, the mobile service is curiously much stronger here than in many other parts of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common there: apples are cooked and baked into pastries all year round, while cherries and plums make an appearance in the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want small but hearty pastries, try Berlin balls, also called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish made from herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be "solid" or "liquid", depending on the amount of sauce it contains.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesia has 17,000 islands, so Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when this term is used without any other qualifier, it tends to refer to foods from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a range of simply seasoned dishes, with peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices being the predominant flavors that Javanese people prefer.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a safety problem: in fact, the user's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth and fairly narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, particularly English ones, have safety bars that allow a stirrup to fall from the saddle if it is pulled back by a rider who falls.
Cochamó Valley – The destination of excellence for climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many large granite walls and cliffs.
From the peaks, the views of the mountains are impregnable. Alpinists from all over the world continue to discover new paths on the slopes, where the possibilities are endless.
Downhill winter sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down a snowy slope with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums", who organize their entire vacations around skiing in specific locations.
The idea of skiing is very ancient: some rock paintings showing skiers date back to 5,000 BC!
The practice of alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century; the first recreational ski club was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegians.
Ski touring: this activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or touring skiing.
It resembles alpine-type backcountry skiing, as well as mountaineering, without, however, generally incorporating these activities, which are practiced on rugged terrain and require the use of much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a similar hiking route.
Under good conditions, you can cover slightly longer distances than on foot - but you will very rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. In classic circumstances, traveling through several countries therefore involves having to make several visa applications and undergo several passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, operates a bit like a single country in this regard.
As long as you stay within this area, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control points again.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa means you do not need to apply separately for a visa for each of the member countries of the area, which saves time, money and administrative formalities.
There is no universal definition to determine whether a manufactured object is an antique. Some tax agencies define items over 100 years old as antiques.
The criteria vary depending on where you are; in some parts of the world, such as North America, the age limit may be lower than that in force in Europe.
Handmade products can be considered antiques, even if they are less old than similar industrial products.
Reindeer husbandry is an important means of subsistence for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding this trade is of great importance to many other professions.
Even if, according to tradition, not all Samis were involved in large-scale reindeer breeding, they lived off fishing, hunting and other similar activities, while using the reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sámi region.
Although widely used, particularly among non-Roms, the term "Gitan" is often considered pejorative due to its association with negative stereotypes and a distorted image of the Roma people.
If the country you are traveling to is subject to a travel warning issued by your government, your international health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also seek advice from other governments, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East could face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Opinions are just a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general, and too simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the generic term for any dangerous meteorological phenomenon that is likely to cause damage, serious social upheaval or loss of human life.
Very unfavorable weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they can be of several types, depending on geographic, topographic, and atmospheric characteristics.
Strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and fires are forms and effects of severe weather, just like thunderstorms, tornadoes, sea squalls, and cyclones.
Extreme, regional and seasonal meteorological phenomena include cold storms, snowstorms with strong winds, and sand or dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to check the risks of bad weather that may affect their destination region, knowing that this may have an impact on the routes they are considering.
Anyone planning to travel to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
A search on the internet for "Courses in hostile environments" will probably provide the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the questions addressed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
Training usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing games, a lot of first aid, and sometimes training in handling weapons.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few and far between.
Travelers who plan to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with no gender marker (X) or updated documents to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is just as variable.
Security checkpoint searches have also become much more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Transsexual people in the preoperative phase should not expect to pass through scanners while preserving their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are currents that return from waves that break on the beach, often on a reef or equivalent.
Due to the submarine topology, the return flow is concentrated on a few deeper sections, and a fast current towards the deep waters can form there.
In most cases, deaths are due to exhaustion resulting from an attempt to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back is not any more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be caught again. It's also possible that, depending on your skills and whether or not you've been spotted, you might want to wait for rescue.
The reintegration shock occurs earlier than the cultural shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had difficulty adapting to a new culture often have a hard time readjusting to their original culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and have lost some of the habits of your original culture.
At first, when you went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country have to adjust.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions in the region for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually, you can always hear the noise of tourists and vendors. The history of sound and light is like a history book.
The Sphinx is placed as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations, with sixteen of them active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples include Livingston and Deception Islands, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then reappear to form the Ellsworth mountain range, 360 km long and crossed by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, includes the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches a height of 4892 m.
In remote areas without a cellular network, you may have no choice but to use satellite telephony.
A satellite phone usually does not replace a cell phone, as you need to be outside and have an unobstructed view of the satellite to make a call.
It is a service often used by navigation, including pleasure boats, as well as by expeditions that have needs for remote data transmission and telephony.
Your local phone operator should be able to tell you more about connecting to this service.
Those who plan a sabbatical year have the opportunity to learn while traveling, and more and more of them are choosing this option.
This formula is particularly appreciated by young people leaving school, as it allows them to take a year off before university, without compromising their studies.
Often, taking a year off to study abroad can actually give you a better chance of pursuing higher education in your home country.
As a general rule, you have to pay a registration fee to follow these educational programs.
Finland is a popular destination for boating, with thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagos and on the lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Pleasure boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from that, it is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises feature an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few full days while returning to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only go ashore on cruise excursions, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
The city of Berlin, Germany, is mentioned in some brochures for cruises. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not at all located near the coast and no visit to this city is included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
There is no need to be ashamed: it is no different from the fears and personal concerns that many people have about other things.
For some, understanding something about how planes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or on not having control.
Transport companies are well paid to make fast deliveries. Often, in the context of an urgent repair, the issue of timing is crucial for the documents, goods or spare parts that are related to it.
On some routes, large companies have their own planes, but on other routes and for small companies, there has been a problem.
If they had sent goods by air freight, on certain routes, it would have taken days to pass through unloading and customs.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations won't allow them to send a bag without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The most obvious way to travel in first class or business class is to shell out a large sum of money for this privilege (or, even better, to ask your company to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class, and eleven times for first class!
In general, it is pointless to try to get discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that they can count on a certain type of travelers who are willing to pay a high price for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they set their prices accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is very common.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that suffers from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but recognized by no member country of the United Nations.
Economic ties have been restored between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
With a population of 3.7 million, Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, the second port after Istanbul, and an excellent transit platform.
What was once the ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and vibrant commercial center, located around a vast bay, surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass buildings, and modern shopping centers are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that more resembles the Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the neighboring island of Eysturoy and is home to an unusual octagonal church.

The 403 bus from Scotturb regularly goes to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
As you head north, be sure to visit the beautiful sanctuary of Notre-Dame de Fatima (temple), a world-renowned site for the apparitions of Mary.
Remember that you are essentially visiting a slaughterhouse, as well as a site that has almost incalculable significance for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many women and men alive who survived their stay here, and many others who saw their loved ones murdered or killed by forced labor, Jews or non-Jews alike.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site by marking or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically everyone is able to speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as the law establishes it as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are only made in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are announced by an automated system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although this stereotype is often inaccurate, the best way to get along in Paris is to behave at your best, to act like someone who is well-mannered. This will make your travels much easier.
The abrupt exterior of Parisians quickly evaporates if you show a minimum of courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely wooded, mainly with beech, spruce and fir trees, and presents a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The country has a wide variety of plant communities due to the diversity of its microclimates, soils, and altitude levels.
The region is also home to a very large variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and capercaillie can be seen there, as well as many other common species.
When visiting a monastery, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and have their shoulders covered as well.
Most monasteries provide shawls to women who arrive with nothing, but if you bring your own, and it's brightly colored, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men must wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can also borrow this garment from the stock at the entrance, but since it is not washed after each use, you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. A single size for men!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the available condiments, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All names, followed by the word Sie which means you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an excellent way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
It can also be said that it facilitates reading, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to know whether a verb or an adjective is used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written
The main letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Please also make sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" in a distinct way: "caro" means "dear", while "carro" means "cart".
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introduction to Persian grammar would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, those who speak a little Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is close enough that it is not necessary to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete today, and remain in place as museums or educational sites.
As light pollution was not as much of a concern in their time as it is today, they are generally located in cities or on campuses, which are easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous infrastructures placed in remote regions where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where cherry blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor only for himself and the other members of the close aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look their best when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even just one.
If you visit a strictly landscaped garden, the removal of "specimens" will also get you expelled without discussion.
Singapore is generally considered an extremely safe place, where it is very easy to get around, and where you can buy almost everything you need once you arrive.
But, located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will need to adapt to the heat (always) and strong sunshine (when the sky is clear, which is rarer).
There are also some buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Check that the bus you plan to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kyriat Arba.
Inland waterways can be an excellent theme for a vacation.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or take a cruise to interesting sites on the Danube or boat along the Erie Canal.
They also define the routes for popular hiking trails and bike paths.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals of Christianity, it celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with these holidays have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
It is traditional to spend the night of Easter awake in an open place to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold a Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, with congregations often bursting into the celebration at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All animals that have arrived on these islands have done so originally by water, swimming or on board floating objects, or by air.
Due to the great distance that separates them from the mainland, mammals were unable to complete the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal of the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of man in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you can experience the polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It's a good opportunity to admire the northern lights, as the sky will be dark almost all day.
As the regions are sparsely populated, and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
The costumes are classic workwear, and employees are called by their last name or their job title.
Workplace harmony is crucial because it emphasizes the collective effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often need their superiors' approval for any decision they make and are supposed to obey their superiors' instructions without asking questions.
