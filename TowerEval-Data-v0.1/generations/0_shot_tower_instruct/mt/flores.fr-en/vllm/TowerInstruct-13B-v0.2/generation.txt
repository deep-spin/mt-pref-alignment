Although the administration of a cocktail of antibodies, ZMapp, had initially shown promising signs in the field, formal studies have shown that its ability to limit deaths did not meet expectations.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp was used as a control, meaning scientists used it as a baseline and compared it to the other three treatments.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and agrees with the absolute necessity for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the statement from the USOC that the best interests of our athletes and our clubs, and our sport, might be better served by moving forward and making significant changes to our organization rather than revoking accreditation.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that can shed light on how the proportion of abuse so courageously described by the survivors of Larry Nassar could have gone unnoticed for so long and adopts any necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the same goal: to make gymnastics, and all sports, as safe as possible so athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and empowering environment.
Throughout the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as an advisor, and then for Lyndon B. Johnson's administration.
In the 1976 campaign, he advised Carter on foreign policy, then served as national security adviser (NSA) from 1977 to 1981, succeeding Henry Kissinger.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely accepted, but provides details that fossils usually cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the animal's plumage was a chestnut brown on top and a pale or carotenoid color on the bottom.
This discovery also helps us to better understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed stem, called a rachis, but do show other feather-like features - barbules and barbs - researchers inferred that the rachis was probably an evolutionary development that came later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were not used for flight but for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that, even if it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not the down of a chick.
The scientists specify that it is indeed the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals a plumage belonging to an adult individual, and not a young one.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other people.

He added that "we should not, however, ask them to assume obligations that exceed their stage of development, their responsibility and their capabilities."
The Iraq Study Group presented its report today at 12:00 GMT.
He warned that no one can guarantee that any action in Iraq at this stage will put an end to sectarian warfare, escalating violence or the slide towards chaos.
The report opens with a call for an open debate and the formation of a consensus in the United States on policy towards the Middle East.
The report is highly critical of almost every aspect of the government's current policy towards Iraq and argues strongly for an immediate change of direction.
The first of its 78 recommendations is that a new diplomatic initiative should be taken before the end of the year to secure Iraq's borders against hostile interventions and to restore diplomatic relations with its neighbours.
The current senator and First Lady of Argentina Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner announced her presidential candidacy last night in La Plata, a city located 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires.

The work done was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon pulls on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way is pulling on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in a kind of halo, and is made up of a large number of small particles.
Television reports show white smoke coming from the factory.
Local authorities are warning people in the area to stay indoors, turn off air conditioning and not drink tap water.

Dr Tony Moll discovered multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said the new mutation was "very disturbing and alarming because of the very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital, according to Dr. Moll, and at least two of them were hospital staff members.
Over a period of one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of TB-DR in the overall TB population still seems low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people have been infected at some point in South Africa.

In 1956, Słania settled in Sweden, where three years later he began working for the Swedish postal service, eventually becoming its chief engraver.
He produced more than 1000 stamps for Sweden and 28 other countries.
His work is of such quality and detail that he is one of the few philatelists well known to the "man in the street" and some collectors devote their entire attention to his work.
Its thousandth stamp was the magnificent "Great Deeds by Swedish Kings" by David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl in 2000, which is in the Guinness Book of Records.
He has also engraved banknotes for many countries, including recent work on the portraits of the Prime Minister on the front of the new Canadian $5 and $100 notes.

Infrared images reveal, given the variations in temperature between day and night, that they are probably caves.
"They are fresher than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night."
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as the large caves of the planet that maintain a constant temperature, but they are similar in that they are deep holes in the ground," according to Glen Cushing, a crew member of the USGS (US Geological Survey) and staff of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters go into a booth, put a pre-printed piece of paper in an envelope indicating the candidate of their choice.
After the officials have checked his identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs his voter card.
The French electoral code regulates the operations quite strictly.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent so that the voters and the observers can see that no envelopes are present at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added, except those of the duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to attend every stage of the process, and votes are counted by volunteers under high surveillance, according to specific procedures.

The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, a police commissioner, said the accused had their faces covered when they appeared in court.
Although three people were in the house when the car hit it, none were injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured to the head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily blocked to allow the emergency services to extract the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was first taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with her son's murder by Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is being held in custody pending her indictment and trial, but eyewitness accounts could be compromised because her portrait has been widely circulated.
It is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish legal system works differently and the courts considered the publication of the pictures potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, of the University of Dundee, notes that "journalists seem to be treading a dangerous line if they publish pictures etc of suspects."
The Crown Prosecutor's office, which is in charge of all prosecutions, told journalists that no further comment would be made at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will focus on the border dispute that Palestine claims on the basis of the existing borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority is only agreeing to a period of five years.
The shooters in the additional trial against the parasites had to be closely monitored by rangers, because the trial was controlled and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers have been recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting head of conservation and heritage at NPWS, the four shooters designated for the first culling campaign were properly trained and briefed on safety procedures.
Martelly yesterday inaugurated a new provisional electoral council (CEP) composed of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth PEC in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures aimed at putting the country on the path to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which were due to take place in 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of defective iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had received reports of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 more incidents of overheating, which the company described as "non-serious."
The ministry reacted by calling the postponement of the report by Apple "truly regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office said no damage was reported in that territory.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no tsunami threat.
A former Philippine policeman has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages were rescued, and the death of at least six of them has been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released prematurely, as were the Philippine photographers.
Photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician, and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was given, it would speed up the baby's lung maturation.
Xinhua news agency reported that government investigators retrieved two flight recorders (or "black boxes") on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons. A unique moment, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as weird as me... maybe even weirder... I love her and I'm going to miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
A poll of 1400 people before the 2010 federal election found the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic had risen 8 per cent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34% of those surveyed share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch to reign over Australia.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 per cent of those surveyed think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games but his fitness has been thrown into doubt by his complaints.
He was unable to take the medication he needed to overcome his pain, as it was banned during the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using different equipment and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water and organic material that can form proteins and support life for the Earth.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and specifically how Earth formed, since it was hit by comets long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors "gossip and political nonsense."
It is believed that he will run for the presidency in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow planes to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, limiting carbon emissions.
It relies on satellite technology, rather than the ground-based radar systems used previously, allowing air traffic controllers to locate planes with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more detailed information.
No additional transport is in place and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parks and park and ride facilities are not available on the ground.
The fear of a lack of transport has led to the possibility that the match could be played behind closed doors, without the supporters of the teams.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science has revealed the genesis of a new species of bird in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden said the new species evolved in just two generations, although the process was thought to be much longer, following breeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant conure finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in many ways. It can be rolled into tiny pieces.
It can be drawn into fine wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and stuck onto another metal. It can be so thin that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called 'illuminated manuscripts'.
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) present in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electron (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then, using clean, damp hands, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will create a strange sensation and produce a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with a flushing system in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remnants of sewer systems have been found in the houses of Minoan towns in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilisation, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women would use the same facilities.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and then sends it back to Earth, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 30 metres high to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways, but the biggest advantage it has given us is that it has made transportation much simpler and faster.
This brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below them are the medium-sized cats that eat prey of a similar size, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and other deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (including free-ranging pet cats) that eat the much more numerous small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of a niche, a special task assigned to each feline, preventing it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called prides.
The packs are made up of one to three related adult males, as well as around thirty females and cubs.
Women are generally very close to each other, their family consisting of a large number of sisters and daughters.
Troops of lions act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in their behaviour, and also very deadly to their prey.
A balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (but sometimes with difficulty), swim, jump great distances and pull with five times the strength of a powerful human.
Tigers are part of the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four big cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger does not resemble the full-throated roar of the lion, but rather a sentence in which the words are cries and growls.
Ocelots are fond of small animals, and they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
According to scientists, ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by smell, sniffing their trail on the ground.
They have excellent night vision and are very stealthy, and ocelots stalk their prey by blending into their surroundings before pouncing.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population it came from (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or river, or moves to a new island so it can't easily get back), it often finds itself in a different environment to the one it was in before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need new characteristics or adaptations to be a powerful competitor compared to what it needed before.
The indigenous population has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be considered as belonging to the same species.
We call this process "speciation," which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants produce their food using the sun through photosynthesis, and they also provide shade.
We make our houses and our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is from plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosasaur was the superpredator of the time, it feared nothing, except for other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 teeth as sharp as razor blades, as well as an additional set of teeth in the palate, so that anything that crossed its path could not escape.
We're not sure, but he may have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex was no match for it.
Although the Romans ate foods we know today, they ate some strange or unusual festive dishes, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and even a type of rodent called a pine marten.
Another difference was that while the poor and the woman ate their food while sitting on chairs, the wealthy men liked to hold banquets together where they reclined on their sides while they ate.
Roman meals in ancient times could not include these American or Asian foods that were introduced to Europe centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a chief temple for each of their gods, which was considered the dwelling place of the god.
People made sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had an open courtyard, then an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Some pyramidal towers, the ziggurats, were sometimes built as elements of a temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were just open counters facing the street. The houses were built of stone.
Since there were no large forests in the land of Canaan, wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and found Greenland - and named it as such - by travelling further west.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country is "Scandinavian," there are many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure: Book of Secrets, you may think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776" were written. The text is at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage in its existence, the large parchment (which measures about 29 and three-quarters inches by 24 inches) was stored rolled up.
It is therefore likely that the notation was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles freed northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, Frenchmen who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupier instead of confronting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies landed in the south of France in an invasion called Operation "Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French Forces had liberated southern France and were heading towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word "civilization" is derived from the Latin word "civilis," which means civil and is related to the Latin words "civis," which means citizen, and "civitas," which means city or city-state and also indicates, in a way, the size of the society to which it refers.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilisational culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural imprint and equitable diffusion.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—the Congress being its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to levy taxes, and, with no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, often uncooperative ones, to enforce its acts.
Nor did it have the power to override state tax laws or tariffs.
Articles required the unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, together with the German national team, the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands that make it up, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipelago".
The first information about Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, while European navigators passing by mentioned it under the name of Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing a transformation of the indigenous practices of cereal production and employing Chinese workers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Hall of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings adjacent to the complex have been reconstructed in order to offer tourists a better insight into their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photography format in the world is 35 mm; it was the most widespread film format at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still made today, but what is important is that its image format is inherited from the photo sensor format of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, and this is quite confusing, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
So the aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest of whole number ratios) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS family of formats) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The third-party rule, much maltreated and often ridiculed, is a simple directive that stimulates dynamism while offering protection to the image.
It indicates that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was called into question.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has bound together the European peoples, in spite of their differences of language and customs.
His omnipresent power touched everyone, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth is to be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over 1000 years and this concentration of power and wealth led many people to question whether this doctrine was being upheld.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain imposed a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law and was codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from venturing into entire maritime areas, thus posing a threat even to neutral ships.
As this tactic only elicited a timid response, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations showed a penchant for pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to prevent such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred dollars to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different eras; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also an unstable age of divided provinces. The best known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, fierce struggles took place between many members of the nobility who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in Chinese ancient history. Thousands of people died in battle to sit on the throne of the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political repercussions such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, the professions were opened up to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same goes for the army, because the ranking of armies is no longer based on class, but on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the scope of this worldly life. He used to visit a cave which became famous as "Hira'a" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived to this day, gives a very vivid picture of the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
Located at the top of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, the cave is totally isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it's not easy at all to find, even if you know it exists. When you enter the cave, you're completely isolated.
Above, there is nothing to contemplate but the clear and magnificent sky and the many surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave, one can see or hear very little of this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many giant structures erected in honor of deceased pharaohs.
The Giza plateau, or "Giza necropolis", in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, is home to several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the most imposing), several small tombs, numerous temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
The "push" symbol looks like a V and the "pull" symbol looks like a staple or a square with the bottom side missing.
High means you start at the tip and push the bow, and low means you start at the nock (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A bow up produces a softer sound, while a bow down is louder and more assertive.
Feel free to mark your own bowings in pencil, but remember that printed bowings are there for musical reasons and should generally be respected.
On 6 October 1789, the king Louis XVI, the queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of vendors.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who were shouting and threatening the king and queen.
The king and queen were forced, because of the crowd, to have the windows of their carriages opened.
At one point, a member of the crowd brandished the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles before the terrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in conquering the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and interests of the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government by the Wall Street banking establishments.
Of course, the superprofits from the prolonged exploitation of the Philippine people could constitute the fundamental benefits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
These events took place in the period generally considered to be the High Middle Ages – the period of European history from the 11th to the 13th centuries (1000-1300).
The Central Middle Ages was preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological push or imperative to a strict sense in which the fate of humanity is dictated by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself proceeds according to a process that largely transcends cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on societies in an intrinsic rather than social sense.
For example, one could say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The massive possession of cars also leads to a greater incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care to treat bodily injuries.
Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
According to Romanticism, geography would have shaped individuals and, over time, customs and a culture linked to this geography would have emerged. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to laws imposed arbitrarily.
In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of contemporary world fashion, Constantinople was considered the capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicentre of luxury began around the year 400 and lasted until around 1100.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which the Byzantine markets could hardly compete with.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its apogee between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the dress was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture to the east.
However, due to the slowness of the means of communication, Western fashions could be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
During the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons for fastening clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic system, using locally adapted seeds, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas, which allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashions, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood.
These children are considered "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the parents' rejection of a severe intellectual or physical disability that the child suffered from.
Feral children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by non-human species, feral children display behaviors (within the limits of their physical abilities) almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning is meant to make learning easier and more interesting, the support goes further.
Support is not a method of learning but more a means of helping learners who are encountering new learning such as using a new programme or starting a new project.
Supports can be both virtual and real, meaning a teacher is a form of support, but so is the little trumpet man in Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to question, guide and explain procedures that might have been too difficult for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster families for a wide range of reasons, from neglect to abuse, including extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, nurturing and educational, but they do.
We see the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the approach to use and gratification.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are considered to be major factors promoting Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reactions to Web sites.
The use of video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, that is, facial expressions lasting a few milliseconds.
It is claimed, in particular, that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, described how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to assess sincerity accurately.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behaviour may be found in animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination alternate the variations between the two pools in each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to satisfy its need for amino acids from the available plant resources.
Furthermore, a lack of response has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all the vital amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your sleep period and dozing off shortly after (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, so that you become aware without waking up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based possibilities include drinking plenty of fluids before bed (especially water or tea, which are known diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace of a person is opposed to the degree of tension in his body and mind.
The lower the voltage, the more positive the vital force present. Every person has the possibility of finding absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualisations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deity. It is through the visualization of different deities that the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras activated, and the awakened consciousness created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, the deep conflicts between their different systems, methods, and cultures ended the agreement between these two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would see actual confrontations, through proxy armies, on battlefields in Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganise along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans became obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern regions of Poland, thereby violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, as well as other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The job of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and goods around, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods around.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, where the Americans were trying to get soldiers and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-Boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close by for easy access to milk, fur, meat and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goatherds who were most often children or adolescents, similar to the more familiar term shepherds. These pastoral methods are still in use today.
"Wagonways" were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks were simply parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach greater speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly rougher day roads.
The cross-ties were introduced early on to keep the tracks in place, but it was gradually realised that the tracks would be more effective if they had an iron strip on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767, the first iron rails appeared.
The very first means of locomotion was walking: humans started walking upright two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus (“upright man”).
Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as a rule.
Bipedal specialisations are found in the fossils of Australopithecus dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign to mitigate the suffering to come.
In many cases, it is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want just a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advancements made by human beings, and the problems have become more serious because of the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing office.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, today known as the "Dunlap Broadsides".
The document's first public reading was by John Nixon in Independence Hall on July 8.
One of these was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap sheets that are still known to exist are the oldest copies of the document; the original manuscript copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists now believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. They are called birds.
Few people consider them dinosaurs, given that they have wings and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaled legs with claws, lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits, or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
See label for specific first aid instructions for this poison.
The term "insect" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term derives from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects that are very well adapted to parasitize humans.
Reduviidae, like bed bugs, are nidicolous, that is, adapted to living in the nest or habitat of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young adults and middle-aged individuals.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may well feel that it is not in their interests, or in the interests of the child, to take on the responsibility of bringing up a baby.
These couples may choose to pursue an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which actually guides most scientific research.
However, it is not the only one, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, to ask questions and make observations, but which also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, and in particular on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend heavily on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a cycle of operation for a certain period even in the absence of external stimulation.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the major indications that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments to label either the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the size of the part of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can cause cells to die or lead to cancer.
Ecotourism is of interest to people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits and ecosystem information.
For example, you can go to see, photograph and discover the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning people leave small country towns by car to go to work and they cross other people who are going to work in the countryside they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system based on private cars and supports it.
Science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has dislodged the biosphere from its state of stability that has sustained human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they break down daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and private vehicles between two points, and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the flow of traffic because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act in a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically in an approximate way.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly allowed them to escape predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them more small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
A few thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times the volume of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on the planet, sometimes reaching 10 km wide.
No less than 20% of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main branch of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were awed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated.
Vatican City drafts its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have been familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because they are found in nature in their raw form and are quite simple to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements, which were earth, water, air, and fire.
Rather, it was the four states of matter (in that order) - solid, liquid, gas and plasma - although he also put forward the theory that these latter transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that include a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the advent of new modes of writing has relegated the pen to a more confidential status and to rarer uses.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever having to get near a ruler.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when the next new thing arrives.
The fission bomb works on the principle of converting energy by assembling a nucleus of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
A bit like making a heavy cart climb a hill, by dividing the nucleus again, and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, so they tend to break apart with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible side and 100 km on the hidden side.
It is thinner over the seas and thicker under the continents.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner, making it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on the search for what makes people feel good or attracted.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they matured into adulthood.
These theories examine what drives some people to want the things they do and what in their environment pushes them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviours can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues, one being to try to remain "the good buddy" (or the good buddy).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting evaluations, delegating responsibilities, and holding others accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he/she must change everything that the group has created up to that point and do things his/her own way.
After all, the head coach is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often leads to dissension between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet across different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each of the members is accountable. It establishes the standards for each of them.
Why would an organization want to go through the tedious process of creating a learning structure? One of the goals of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional services of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be fully expressed.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer’s need.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and its own learning culture.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus reducing the scope of research and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, injury, tumors and trauma affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly associated with science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science that studies the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Research in artificial intelligence aims to automate tasks that require an intelligent approach by machines.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as recognition of writing, voice and face.
These practices led to distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions to everyday problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it has been put into place in several home computer software and video games.
Field trips are an integral part of any school class. Often, a teacher would like to take his or her students to places where a bus trip is not feasible.
The solution is technology in the form of virtual field trips, where students can look at ancient artifacts in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful work of art while sitting with their class.
Practically participating in an excursion is also an excellent way to reflect on a journey and share experiences with future generations.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their visit to the state capital, and each year the site is updated, but the old versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogging can also help students improve their writing skills. Even if students often try blogging with sloppy grammar and spelling, having an audience usually makes them improve.
As students are often the most critical audience, the blogger is starting to try to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogging "forces students to become more aware of the world around them" and the need to generate interest from an audience encourages students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that fosters collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
"When used appropriately, blogs ""can help students develop their analytical and critical thinking skills: by actively engaging with online content, they can compare their views with others and articulate their own perspectives on specific issues"" (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada and has a large number of art galleries and museums that highlight Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and to the north is the Muskoka region and surrounding areas, which boast pristine natural beauty.
All of these measures, and many more, make Ontario what foreigners consider the quintessential Canada.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited in the wild.
For a population comparison that surprises more than one: There are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even a continent in itself, when it comes to fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known for being luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought the practice of Islam to the land and this religion spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered the Cape Route that connects Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
To women: It is recommended that any woman traveling say she is married, regardless of her marital status.
It is also advisable to wear a wedding ring (which should not seem too precious.
Women need to realize that some cultural differences can lead to behaviors that they consider harassment, such as being followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting male advances, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn't mean it's acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who after destroying it had rebuilt it and named it Casa Branca, finally abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco to shop.
Around the old medina, it is easy to find places to buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and all sorts of trinkets, but that's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano which buried most of the city's streets, particularly the city center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma should be researched to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for mountain gorilla tracking treks among the cheapest in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get around in Goma. The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for far-off and exotic lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS series "Wonders of the African World."
The city contrasts strongly with the cities of the rest of the country, because it has a style that is more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The total surface area of the park is 19,500 km², divided into 14 ecozones, each of which is home to specific fauna.
It is one of the most famous amusement parks in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees to the park.
It can be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card which gives access to certain parks in South Africa, as well as all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the main center of interest for many tourists.
The row of buildings that draws the horizon of Hong Kong has been compared to a shimmering bar graph, which is revealed by reflection in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To admire the most beautiful panoramas of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the waterfront of Kowloon, located opposite.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on the reclaimed land of the north shore.
This is the place that the British settlers invested in, so it seems to me to be a good starting point if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80km (50 miles) from the coast inland into Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps: they also contain some of the last remnants of the majestic jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about a third is covered by water/marshland.
Sundarbans has been a nature reserve since 1966, and you can find around 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer there.
Buses leave from the Inter-District Bus Station (located on the other side of the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those to the east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30am and 7:30am.
Inter-district buses are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese cabin cruisers, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 metres; it is 378 metres long and has two lanes 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are completed.
The Guarani were the largest indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing subsistence agriculture.
Other indigenous tribes that populated the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú or the Payaguá, survived essentially thanks to fishing, hunting, or gathering.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, once known as the "giant province of the Indies", was born from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous populations.
The Spanish inaugurated the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
In addition, tournaments and lesser matches are sometimes held here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets to polo matches, check out the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP) which is equivalent in value to the British Pound Sterling (GBP).
Cash can be exchanged at the islands' only bank in Stanley, opposite FIC West.
Sterling is a commonly accepted currency throughout the islands, while in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the surrounding islands, although British and American currency may be. Speak to the owners in advance to agree on a method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so change it before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone and summer temperatures of over 30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
There are not really "rainy" and "dry" seasons: rainfall is more or less constant throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, they are still wild animals and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you must stay at least 100 metres away from bears and wolves and 25 metres away from all other wild animals!
As docile as they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep a safe distance. These animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking odorous foods and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, with the exception of a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
The paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful gathering in the town during the independence struggle organised by the Mau movement.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is located on two harbours. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the chic suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches, sometimes very popular with families, have many shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One", a fairly ordinary but tasty and refreshing beer. There is also another local beer, "Manta".
There are plenty of French wines to taste, but the New Zealand and Australian wines might travel better.
You can drink the local tap water safely, but you can easily find bottled water if you have concerns about it.
The idea of a 'cafe creme' is foreign to Australians - a flat white is an 'espresso', a cappuccino is filled with cream (not froth) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries from any of these reef causes are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, box jellyfish are found around the beaches and river estuaries north of 1770. They can also sometimes be seen outside of this period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and would stay away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their main habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveller peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have deals with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation, such as camping grounds, through travel agencies.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even packages that combine flight and accommodation.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or to get other necessary documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
However, any changes or requests must be addressed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of attendees decide to camp on site, and most consider it an integral part of the experience.
If you want to get up close and personal with the music event, you'll need to arrive early to secure a good camping spot.
Remember that even if the main stage music shows are over, other music shows may continue late into the night at other festival sites.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, make sure to check the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice can cause unbearable noise for the most exposed cabins.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in the city, and cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see details).
Casinos typically go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by customers, with few windows and clocks, and exits that can be difficult to find.
They usually offer special deals on food, drinks and entertainment in order to keep the guests in good spirits and keep them on the premises.
In some places, it is the locals who offer free alcoholic drinks. Nevertheless, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good players know that it is crucial to stay sober.
Anyone driving to high latitudes or over mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a very short time to block you in.
Visibility may also be limited by falling snow or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and traffic is practically uninterrupted all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist draw in Africa and the highlight of many visitors' trips.
In common parlance, the term "safari" refers to an excursion on African land, and in particular in the savannah, with the aim of witnessing the striking spectacle of wild animals in their natural habitat.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to the cars and the standard equipment allows for good observation.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "bush walk," "walking safari," or "footing") involves hiking for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two summer Olympic Games, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may be faced with a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies don't extend through July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with typical tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry more easily. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that can be borrowed, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron or don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if you can find one.
Avoid overheating the fabric (which can cause shrinkage or in extreme cases, burning).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling the water for one minute is enough; in others, it must be boiled for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have a concern, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter pests that they are not familiar with in their home region.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritation or, in the most serious cases, trigger allergic reactions, spread venom or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are generally not considered parasites.
In some locations, duty-free shops offer an opportunity to purchase goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travellers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes make significant savings, particularly on products such as alcohol or tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the toughest driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, frequently passing through remote backcountry terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep an open mind: steep inclines, narrow lanes and tight bends are the norm.
The speed limits are significantly lower than on the preceding and following sections - usually 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and adhering to them is even more important than before.
Mobile service, however, is curiously much stronger here than in many other parts of the state, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common here: apples are cooked and baked into pastries all year round, while cherries and plums make an appearance in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts, and popular cakes often pair particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but filling pastries, try Berliners, also known as Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be either "wet" or "dry" depending on the amount of sauce it contains.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a broad term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without qualification, it tends to refer to foods from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a range of simply seasoned dishes, with peanuts, chillies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices being the predominant flavours favoured by the Javanese.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a safety problem: in fact, the user's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse runs off. To minimise this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth and fairly narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, particularly English ones, have safety bars that allow a stirrup to drop from the saddle if it is pulled back by a rider who falls.
Cochamó Valley – The premier climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many different large granite walls and cliffs.
From the summits, the panoramic views of the mountains are impregnable. Alpinists from all over the world keep discovering new paths on the slopes, where the possibilities are limitless.
Downhill winter sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down a snowy slope with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many aficionados, sometimes called "ski bums," who plan their entire vacations around skiing in specific locations.
The idea of skiing is very old: some rock paintings showing skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The practice of alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century; the first recreational ski club was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegians.
Cross-country skiing: This activity is also called Nordic skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It resembles alpine touring skiing, as well as mountaineering, but does not generally incorporate those activities, which are done on rugged terrain and require the use of much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a similar hiking route.
Under good conditions, you can cover distances a little longer than on foot - but you will rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it is made up of many independent countries, so in a classic scenario, traveling through several countries would mean having to apply for several visas and undergo several passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, operates a bit like a single country in this regard.
As long as you stay within this area, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control again.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa means you do not need to apply separately for a visa for each of the member countries of the area, which saves time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique manufactured item. Some tax authorities define items over 100 years old as antiques.
The criteria vary depending on where you are; in some parts of the world, such as North America, the age limit may be lower than in Europe.
Handmade products can be considered antiques, even if they are less old than similar industrial products.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood for the Sami people and the culture surrounding this trade is of great importance to many other professions.
Although, according to tradition, not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, they lived off fishing, hunting and other similar activities, while using the reindeer mainly as draught animals.
Nowadays, many Sámi people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sámi region.
Although widely used, especially by non-Roma, the term "Gypsy" is often considered pejorative because of its association with negative stereotypes and a distorted image of the Roma people.
If the country you are travelling to has a travel warning issued by your government, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also take advice from other governments than your own, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Opinions are only a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general and too simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the generic term for any dangerous meteorological phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
Very unfavourable weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they can be of different types, depending on geographical, topographical and atmospheric characteristics.
High winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Extreme, regional and seasonal weather events include cold snaps, snowstorms with high winds, and sand or dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to check the weather risks that may affect their destination region, as this may have an impact on the itineraries they plan.
Anyone who is considering travelling to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
A Google search for "hostile environment courses" will probably provide the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
Training normally lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travellers who plan to have sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid travel documents for their return journey.
Governments' willingness to issue passports with an unspecified gender (X) or documents updated to match a person's desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is just as variable.
Security checkpoint pat-downs have also become much more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Transsexual people in the pre-operative phase should not expect to pass through the scanners while preserving their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are currents that return from waves breaking on the beach, often over a reef or equivalent.
Due to the submarine topography, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, where a fast current to the deep water can form.
In most cases, deaths are due to exhaustion from attempting to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you are out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be caught again. Depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted or not, you may want to wait for rescue.
The reinsertion shock occurs earlier than the cultural shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travellers who have had difficulty adapting to a new culture often have a hard time readjusting to their original culture.
When you come back home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and lost some habits from your original culture.
At first, when you went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country have to adjust.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually, you can always hear the noise of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is like a history book.
The Sphinx is placed as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are lit up.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations, sixteen of which are active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples: Livingston and Deception Island, where the caldera flooded by an active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then reappear to form the Ellsworth mountain range, 360 km long and crossed by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, includes the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson massif, which reaches a height of 4892 m.
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, you may have no other choice but to use satellite phones.
A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a mobile phone, as you need to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
This is a service often used by navigation, including recreational craft, as well as by expeditions that have needs for remote data transmission and telephony.
Your local phone company should be able to tell you more about connecting to this service.
Those who plan a sabbatical year have the opportunity to learn while travelling, and more and more of them are choosing this possibility.
This formula is particularly appreciated by young people leaving school, as it allows them to take a year off before university, without compromising their studies.
Often, taking a gap year course abroad can actually give you a better chance of going on to higher education in your home country.
As a rule, you have to pay a registration fee to take part in these educational programmes.
Finland is a top destination for boating, with the “Land of a Thousand Lakes” also boasting thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in the archipelago and on the lakes.
While the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are indeed big enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from that, it is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises feature an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few whole days while returning to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only go ashore on cruise excursions, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
The city of Berlin, Germany is mentioned in some brochures for cruises. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not at all near the coast and no visit to this city is included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be a scary experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
There is no shame in this: it is no different from the fears and anxieties that many people have about other things.
For some, understanding something about how planes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or a lack of control.
Transport companies are well paid for making fast deliveries. In the case of an urgent repair, the issue of delivery times is often crucial for the documents, goods or spare parts involved.
On some routes, big companies have their own planes, but on other routes and for small companies, there has been a problem.
If they had sent goods by air freight, on some routes, it would have taken days to get through unloading and customs.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations won't allow them to send a bag without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The most obvious way to travel in first or business class is to shell out a lot of money for the privilege (or, better still, to ask your company to do it for you).
However, it's not cheap: generally, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class, and eleven times for first class!
In general, it is not worth trying to get discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that they can count on a certain type of traveller who is willing to pay dearly for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they price accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is very widespread.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that suffers from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but recognized by no member country of the United Nations.
Economic ties have been restored between the two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
With a population of 3.7 million, Izmir is Turkey's third largest city, the second port after Istanbul, and an excellent hub.
What was once the ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, developed and lively commercial centre, set around a vast bay, surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, glassy buildings and modern shopping malls are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, 18th-century marketplaces and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that feels more like Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the neighbouring island of Eysturoy and is home to an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves on some of the graves.
It is worth taking a half-hour stroll around this fascinating village.

Bus 403 from Scotturb runs regularly to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
When heading north, be sure to visit the beautiful sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (temple), a world-renowned site for the apparitions of Mary.
Remember that you are essentially visiting a graveyard, as well as a site that has almost incalculable significance for a large portion of the world's population.
There are still many women and men alive who survived their stay here, and many others who saw their loved ones murdered or killed by forced labor, Jews or non-Jews alike.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site by marking or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically everyone is able to speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as the law establishes it as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the metro are only made in Catalan, but unscheduled disruptions are announced by an automated system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although this stereotype is often inaccurate, the best way to get along in Paris is to behave at your best, to act like someone who is well-mannered. This will make your travels much easier.
Parisians' abrupt exterior quickly evaporates if you show a minimum of courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely wooded, mainly with beech, spruce and fir trees, and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The country has a great variety of plant communities due to the diversity of its microclimates, soils and altitude levels.
The region is also home to a very wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and capercaillie can be seen there, as well as many other common species.
When visiting a monastery, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and have their shoulders covered as well.
Most monasteries provide shawls for women who arrive with nothing, but if you bring your own, and it's brightly coloured, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men must wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can also borrow this garment from the stock at the entrance, but as it is not washed after each use, you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all for men!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the condiments available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All names, followed by the word Sie, which means you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an excellent way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
It can also be said that it facilitates reading, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to know whether a verb or an adjective is used in a substantivised form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written
The main letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel.
Also, please make sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: "caro" means "dear," while "carro" means "cart."
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introduction to Persian grammar would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, those who know a little Spanish might conclude hastily that Portuguese is close enough that it need not be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete today, and remain in place as museums or educational sites.
As light pollution was not as much of a concern back then as it is today, they are generally located in cities or on campuses, which are easier to access than those built in the modern era.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities placed in remote areas where atmospheric conditions are favourable.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where cherry blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor only for himself and the other members of the close aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look their best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "just one."
If you visit a strictly landscaped garden, the removal of "specimens" will also get you thrown out without discussion.
Singapore is generally considered an extremely safe place to be, with easy transportation and almost everything you need available to buy once you arrive.
But, located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to adapt to the heat (always) and to strong sunshine (when the sky is clear, which is less common).
There are also a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Check that the bus you are considering taking goes to Hebron and not just the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be an excellent theme for a holiday.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or take a cruise to interesting sites on the Danube or boat along the Erie Canal.
They also define the routes for popular hiking trails and bike paths.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals of Christianity, it celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with these holidays have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
It is traditional to spend the night of Easter awake in an open place to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold a Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, with congregations often bursting into celebration at the stroke of midnight to mark the resurrection of Christ.
All animals that have arrived on these islands have done so originally by water, swimming or on board floating objects, or by air.
Because of the great distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to make the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazer of the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you can experience the polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It's a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark almost all day.
Because the regions are sparsely populated, light pollution is often not a problem, so you can also enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be accustomed to.
The costumes are classic workwear, and employees are addressed by their family name or job title.
Workplace harmony is crucial because it emphasizes the collective effort rather than the praise of individual achievements.
Workers often have to get their superiors' approval for any decision they make and are supposed to obey their superiors' instructions without question.
