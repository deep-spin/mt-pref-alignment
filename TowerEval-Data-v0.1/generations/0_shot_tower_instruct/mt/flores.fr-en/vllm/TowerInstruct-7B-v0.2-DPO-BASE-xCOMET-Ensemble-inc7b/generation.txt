Even though the administration of an antibody cocktail, ZMapp, had initially shown promising results in the field, formal studies have shown that its ability to limit deaths did not meet expectations.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control, meaning scientists used it as a baseline and compared it to the other three treatments.
The USA Gymnastics Federation supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute necessity for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the statement by the USOC that the interests of our athletes and clubs, as well as their sport, would be better served by moving forward with meaningful changes within our organization rather than revoking accreditation.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could shed light on how the abuse of power so bravely described by the survivors of Larry Nassar could have gone unnoticed for so long, and adopts any necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the same goal: to make gymnastics, as well as other sports, as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowering environment.
Throughout the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as an advisor, and then for the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely accepted, but provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's plumage was brownish-gray on top and pale or carotenoid-colored on the bottom.
This discovery also allows us to better understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers did not have a fully developed stem, or rachis, but did show other features typical of feathers—barbs and barbules—researchers concluded that the rachis likely developed later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for regulation or displaying temperature. The researchers suggested that, even if the sample comes from the tail of a young dinosaur, it shows adult plumage rather than the down of a chick.
The scientists specify that this is indeed the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals a plumage belonging to an adult individual, and not a young one.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, this morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

They found that the Sun operates according to the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all stars in the system is determined by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
Brightness and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the flow of plasma.
As for magnetic inversions, the smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star.

The work done was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
According to this theory, the majority of dark matter around a galaxy is found in a kind of halo, and is made up of a large number of small particles.

Dr Tony Moll discovered multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (TB-MR) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
"In an interview, he stated that the new mutation was 'very troubling and alarming due to the very high mortality rate'."
According to Dr. Moll, some patients contracted the virus in the hospital, and at least two of them were part of the hospital staff.
Over the course of a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.

"They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night."
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of the large caves on the planet, which maintain a constant temperature, but they are similar in that they are deep holes in the ground," according to Glen Cushing, a member of the crew of the USGS (United States Geological Survey) and staff at Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters retreat to a booth and put a pre-printed paper slip indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the officers verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs their voter registration card.
The French Electoral Code regulates operations quite strictly.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that no envelopes are present at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are added, except those of duly counted and authorised voters.
Candidates can send representatives to attend each stage of the process, and the votes are counted by volunteers under high supervision according to specific procedures.

Uka's weapon jammed as she pointed it at the head of a fifth man. Schneider suffers from excruciating pain, has lost sight in one eye, has lost part of his skull, and his face has been reconstructed using titanium.
Schneider testified via video link from an USAF base in his home country.
Apart from the event on Wednesday, Carpanedo participated in two individual races during the Championships.
She first competed in the slalom, where she received a "did not finish" (DNF) during her first race. 36 of the 116 competitors received the same result in this race.
In her other race, the giant slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's sitting group with a combined time of 4:41.30, which is 2:11.60 minutes slower than the winning Austrian athlete Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-placed Hungarian athlete Gyöngyi Dani.
In the category of women's sitting skiing, four skiers failed to complete their course; in the giant slalom, 45 skiers out of a total of 117 in this race failed to finish.
The police in Madhya Pradesh found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people for raping the Swiss national, and we have recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, police commissioner, said that the accused had their faces covered when they appeared in court.
Although three people were present in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured to the head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily blocked to allow emergency services to extract the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was first taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son by the Sheriff Court in Edinburgh.
She has been placed under house arrest pending her indictment and trial, but eyewitness accounts could be compromised as her image has been widely circulated.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice operates differently and the courts considered publication of the photos potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to be treading a dangerous line if they publish photos etc. of suspects."
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is responsible for all prosecutions, told journalists that no further comment would be made until at least after the charging decision.
According to the leak, the document will focus on the border dispute that Palestine claims based on the existing borders prior to the Middle East war of 1967.
Other topics discussed include the future of the city of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority is only willing to agree to a period of five years.
The additional testers for the parasite control product had to be closely monitored by rangers, as the trial was controlled and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers have been recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting head of park conservation and heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first culling campaign were duly trained and instructed on safety procedures.
Martelly swore in a new provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth PEC in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures aimed at setting the country on a path towards new elections.
This commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against his regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were sparked by the lack of elections, some of which were due to take place in 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating in defective iPods have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it had been made aware of 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, the METI announced that Apple had informed them of an additional 34 cases of overheating, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "truly regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Bureau of Emergency Management of the Northern Mariana Islands reported that no damage had been reported in that country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and the death of at least six of them has been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released prematurely, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly woman who needed to use the restroom, and Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career as a doctor.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births in his free time.
Her research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the baby's lung maturation.
The Xinhua news agency reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders (or "black boxes") on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night of two moons. A unique moment, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin “Goldust” Runnels commented that “Luna was as weird as me… maybe even weirder… I love her and I’m going to miss her… I hope she’s resting in a better place.”
A poll of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election found opposition to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 per cent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those surveyed share this view and wish that Queen Elizabeth II be the last monarch to reign over Australia.
At the extremes of the poll, 29% of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness has been called into question following his complaints.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to alleviate his pain, as such medication is prohibited within the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date on January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery using different equipment and software at the beginning of February, and the discovery was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for Earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and promote life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and in particular how the Earth formed, since comets collided with it long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and signed legislation last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described the rumours as "gossip and political nonsense."
It is thought that he will run for president in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow planes to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, limiting carbon emissions.
It relies on satellite technology, rather than the ground-based radar systems used previously, allowing air traffic controllers to locate planes with greater precision and provide pilots with more detailed information.
Additional transportation is non-existent and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available on the ground.
The fear of a lack of transport has led to the possibility that the match could be played behind closed doors, without the teams' supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the genesis of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have indicated that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was estimated to be much longer, following reproduction between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant conebill finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in many ways. It can be rolled into tiny pieces.
It can be drawn into fine wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and pasted onto another metal. It can be so thin that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called 'illuminated manuscripts'.
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The juice from cabbage changes colour depending on the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) present in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electron (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then, with clean and damp hands, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will create a strange sensation and produce a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with a flush in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the houses of Minoan towns in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women would use them together.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and then sends it back to Earth almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and vision.
A giant rocket more than 30 metres tall is needed to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways, the greatest advantage it has brought us being that it has made transportation much simpler and faster.
This brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized felines that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and other deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (including domestic cats that roam free) that eat far more numerous small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a special task assigned to each feline, preventing them from competing with one another.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
Packs are made up of one to three related adult males, as well as around thirty females and cubs.
Women are generally very close to each other, as their family consists of a large number of sisters and daughters.
Lion troops act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in their behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (albeit sometimes with difficulty), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a powerful human.
The tiger belongs to the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars; these four felines are the only ones capable of roaring.
The roar of a tiger does not resemble the full-throated roar of a lion, but rather a phrase in which the words would be cries and growls.
Ocelots are fond of small animals; they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds whenever they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
According to scientists, ocelots track down and find their prey (animals to eat) by smell, sniffing out their trail on the ground.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their nocturnal vision, and they also move very quietly. Ocelots stalk their prey by blending in with their surroundings before pouncing on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main population it originated from (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily return), it often finds itself in a different environment than the one it was previously in.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need new characteristics or adaptations in order to be a strong competitor compared to what it needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be considered to belong to the same species.
We call this process "speciation," which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., breathe out).
Plants produce their food using the sun through photosynthesis, and they also provide shade.
We make our houses and clothes out of plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its time, fearing nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, as well as an additional set of teeth in the palate, so that anything that crossed its path could not escape.
We're not sure, but it's possible he had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it's even possible he was a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that went into the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex was no match for it.
Although the Romans consumed food that we are familiar with, they did eat some strange or unusual festive dishes, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and the loir, a type of rodent.
Another difference: while the poor and women ate their food while sitting on chairs, wealthy men liked to organize banquets together where they would rest on their sides while eating.
The Roman meals of antiquity could not have included these foods of American or Asian origin, which were introduced to Europe centuries later.
For example, they did not have maize, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the god's dwelling place.
People would bring sacrifices to the gods, and priests would try to meet the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had an open courtyard, followed by an inner sanctuary that could only be accessed by priests.
Some pyramidal towers, the ziggurats, were sometimes built as elements of a temple.
The summit of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The majority of the Hebrew family's life took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were nothing more than open stalls facing the street; the houses were built of stone.
As there were no large forests in the land of Canaan, wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. According to Scandinavian sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, while travelling further west, he discovered Greenland and gave it its name.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
While each country is "Scandinavian," there are many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. While there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, one could read the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text is at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage in its existence, the large parchment (measuring about 29 inches three-quarters by 24 inches) was stored rolled up.
It is therefore likely that the notation was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landing and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was governed by the Vichy French, French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies landed in the south of France, in an invasion called Operation "Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Forces of the Free France had liberated the south of France and were heading towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The term "civilization" is derived from the Latin word "civilis," which means civil and is related to the Latin words "civis," which means citizen, and "civitas," which means large city or city-state and also, in a sense, indicates the size of the society to which it refers.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge across multiple generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and equitable diffusion.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government — the Congress being its only component — under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on the often uncooperative authorities of the states to enforce all its acts.
Nor did he have the power to waive tax laws or those on customs duties between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German national team, the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands that make it up, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipelago."
The first information about Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, while European navigators who passed through the area mentioned it under the name of Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan, introducing a transformation of the indigenous practices of cereal production and employing Chinese workers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings that border the complex have been reconstructed in order to offer tourists a better view of their original appearance.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and this restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photography format in the world is 35 mm; this was the most widespread film format at the end of the era of analogue film.
It is still manufactured today, but what is important is that its image format is inherited from the format of the photographic sensor in digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, and this is quite surprising, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
So the aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to get the simplest of integer ratios) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format family, for example) are equal to or closely approximate this aspect ratio.
The third-party rule, which has been grossly mistreated and often ridiculed, is a simple directive that promotes dynamism while offering protection for one's image.
It indicates that the most effective placement for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was called into question.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has bound European states together despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over 1,000 years, and this concentration of power and money has led many people to question whether this doctrine is being upheld.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Great Britain implemented a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law as codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters in order to prevent ships from venturing into entire maritime areas, thus posing a threat even to neutral vessels.
As this tactic only elicited a timid response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations showed a preference for pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take up employment at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred dollars in his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss in his previous job) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing the different eras; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
In between each dynasty, there was also an unstable age of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted for 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these periods, fierce struggles took place between numerous members of the nobility who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest in the history of Chinese antiquity, with thousands dying in battle to sit on the throne of the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political repercussions such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
Also, after the Revolution, the professions were opened up to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same goes for the army, as the classification of armies is no longer based on class, but on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working classes in other countries to begin their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that went beyond the confines of worldly life, and he used to visit a cave that became famous under the name of "Hira'" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived to this day, provides a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it's not at all easy to find, even if you know it exists. When you enter the cave, you are completely isolated.
Above, one can see nothing but the clear and magnificent sky and the many surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, one can see or hear very little of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many giant structures erected in honor of deceased pharaohs.
The Giza plateau, or "Giza necropolis," in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, is home to several pyramids (with the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, numerous temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
The "push" symbol looks like a V, and the "pull" symbol looks like a staple or a square with one side missing.
The top means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and the bottom means you should start at the riser (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An upward stroke generally produces a softer sound, while a downward stroke is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to write in your own markings with a pencil, but remember that the printed bow marks are there for musical reasons, and should generally be respected.
On October 6th, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old), and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of vendors.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and hurled threats against the king and queen.
The king and queen were forced, due to the crowd, to have the windows of their carriages opened.
At one point, a member of the crowd brandished the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles before the terrorized queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large portion of the expenses and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking institutions.
Naturally, the superprofits resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could constitute the fundamental benefits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
These events took place during the period generally considered to be the High Middle Ages—the period of history in Europe from the 11th to the 13th century (1000-1300).
The Central Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally end around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological momentum or technological imperative to a strict sense in which the destiny of humanity is dictated by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself proceeds according to a process that largely transcends cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on intrinsically conditioned societies rather than socially conditioned ones.
For example, one could argue that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The massive ownership of cars also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of healthcare to treat physical injuries.
Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
According to Romanticist theories, geography would shape individuals, and over time, customs and a culture related to this geography would emerge, which, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to laws imposed arbitrarily.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as the epicentre of luxury began around the year 400 and lasted until around 1100.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders returned laden with gifts such as silk and spices, which the Byzantine markets found difficult to compete with.
It was during this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the dress was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture to the east.
However, due to the slowness of means of communication, Western fashions could be up to 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons for closing clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is farming carried out in order to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, using seed stocks native to the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnic origin, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashions, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood.
These children are considered "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the parents rejecting a serious intellectual or physical disability suffered by the child.
Wild children may have suffered serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in the wild.
When fully raised by non-human species, feral children exhibit behaviors (within the limits of their physical abilities) almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further.
Support is not a method of learning, but rather a means of helping learners who are discovering new teaching material, such as the use of a new program or the start of a new project.
Supporters can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little trombone man from Microsoft Office is too.
The virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is designed to question, guide and explain procedures that might have been too difficult for the student to manage on their own.
Children are placed in foster homes for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, to extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, nurturing and educational, but that is the case.
We view the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Placement in a foster home is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
The internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the approach to uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are considered to be major factors that promote Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" have also been identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when studying public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to major discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, i.e., facial expressions lasting only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to detect if someone is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may exist in animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth century research has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination alternate variations between the two pools in each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to humans to meet its amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
Furthermore, a lack of response has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large quantity of proteins containing all the vital amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking yourself up during your sleep period and then falling back asleep shortly thereafter (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively silent alarm clock, so that you can regain consciousness without fully waking up.
If you find yourself resetting the clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biological-based options include drinking plenty of fluids before bed (such as water or tea, which are known to be diuretic), which will force you to wake up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace of a person is in opposition to the degree of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force is. Every person has the possibility to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment; the only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple: it consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deity. It is through the visualization of different deities that the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, deep-seated conflicts between their different systems, methods, and cultures ended the understanding between these two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and see real confrontations, through proxy armies, on battlefields in Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union arrived and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, thereby violating the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, as well as other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships for the transportation of goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The job of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and your goods, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and their goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, where the Americans were trying to get soldiers and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily using U-boats, attempted to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Great Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them close by for easy access to milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by herders who were mostly children or teenagers, similar to the more well-known term "shepherds." These pastoral methods are still in use today.
The "wagonways" were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the tracks for the wagons were simply made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses that pulled them to reach higher speeds and carry heavier loads than on the slightly more rugged roads of the day.
The crossbars were introduced early on to keep the tracks in place, but it was eventually realised that the tracks would be more effective if they had a strip of iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels, and in 1767 the first iron rails were introduced.
The very first means of locomotion was walking: humans began walking upright two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus ("upright man").
Their predecessors, the australopiths, did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedal specializations are found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as far back as seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign to alleviate future suffering.
In many cases, this is symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and neutralize them.
It is clear that the world has changed a great deal thanks to the scientific and technological advancements made by human beings, and that the problems have become more serious due to overpopulation and humanity's extravagant lifestyle.
After its adoption by the Congress on July 4, a manuscript draft signed by the president of the Congress, John Hancock, and the secretary, Charles Thomson, was then sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, today known as the "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of these was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist are the oldest copies of the document; the original manuscript copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists now believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today—they are called birds.
Few people consider them to be dinosaurs, given that they have wings and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have paws covered in scales and equipped with claws, they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like T-Rexes.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits, or bits for short in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible; symptoms such as vomiting are so general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indicator of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Consult the label for specific first aid instructions for this poison.
The term "insect" is used by entomologists in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
The term derives from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects that are highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Reduviids, like bed bugs, are nidicolous, meaning they are adapted to live in their host's nest or habitat.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young people and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to have multiple sclerosis.
A couple may very well feel that it is not in their interest, nor in the interest of the child, to take care of the education of a baby.
These couples can choose to pursue an adoption plan for their baby.
In the case of adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which guides most scientific research.
However, this is not the only one; experimentation is also a test that is used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, to ask questions and make observations, but it also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, and in particular the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's opinions on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behaviour often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a cycle of operation for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, either labeling the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the size of the part of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to offspring, while other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is of interest to people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, particularly the wildlife and flora.
Examples of activities that can be done on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
For example, you can go to see, photograph, and discover the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small towns in their cars to go to work and cross paths with others who are going to work in the countryside they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is in a way connected to and supporting a transport system based on private cars.
Science now shows that this carbon-based economy has dislodged the biosphere from its state of stability, which has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses the transportation systems. Virtually everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, why do they break down on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent, or is something more fundamental at play?
Traffic flow is the study of the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the flow of traffic because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically in an approximate manner.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow rate, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to do so allowed them to more easily escape their enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies.
This gives them more small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
A few thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed otherwise: that the solar system was moving around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems reasonable, as the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times the volume of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes reaching a width of 10 km.
No less than 20% of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main branch of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza have never been surpassed in terms of their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were awed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
The Vatican has approximately 800 inhabitants and is the smallest independent country in the world, as well as the least populated.
The Vatican City State drafts its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of Vatican City are all Catholic.
Since ancient times, people have been familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, as they occur in nature in their raw form and are relatively simple to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
Rather, he described the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also posited that these states transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that include a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it first came out.
Unfortunately, the emergence of new writing methods has relegated the pen to a more private status and to rarer uses.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever having to approach a ruler.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when the next new gadget arrives.
The fission bomb works according to the following principle: it converts energy by assembling a nucleus made up of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
A bit like trying to get a heavy cart up a hill. By dividing the core again, and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, so they tend to break apart with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust, and its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is approximately 70 km on the visible side and 100 km on the hidden side.
It is thinner at sea level and thicker under continents.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner, making it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what makes people feel good or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what drives some people to want to do the things they do, and what in their environment pushes them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow’s hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg’s two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues: one being to try to remain "the good friend" (or "the good friend" colleague).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting evaluations, delegating responsibilities, and holding others accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he/she must change everything that the group has created up until that point and do things their own way.
After all, the manager is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behaviour often leads to divisions between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet based on different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member is accountable; it sets the standards for each of them.
Why would an organization want to go through the tedious process of creating a learning structure? One of the goals of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional services of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can fully express themselves.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
Before an organization can be innovative, its management must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and its own culture of learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thereby allowing the research field to be narrowed down and made much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of damage, lesions, tumors, and trauma to the brain affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes like never before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly associated with science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science, which studies the intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation of machines.
Research in artificial intelligence aims to automate tasks that require an intelligent approach using machines.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnostic and customer queries, and the recognition of writing, voice and faces.
These practices have led to distinct disciplines focused on providing solutions to everyday problems.
The AI system is now commonly used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and has been integrated into various home computer and video game software.
Excursions are an integral part of any school class. Very often, a teacher would like to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution comes in the form of virtual educational field trips, where students can view ancient artifacts from a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful work of art all while sitting with their class.
Participating in a practical excursion is also an excellent way to reflect on a trip and share your experiences with future generations.
For example, students at Bennet High School in North Carolina design a website each year about their visit to the state capital. Each year the site is updated, but older versions are kept online to serve as an archive.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even though students often start blogging with poor grammar and spelling, having an audience generally improves the situation.
As students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogging "obliges students to become more familiar with the world around them." The need to pique the public's interest encourages students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that fosters collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
"When used properly, blogs 'can help students to strengthen their analytical and critical thinking skills: by actively reacting to online content, they can compare their opinions with those of others and express their own views on specific topics'" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada and has a large number of art galleries and museums that highlight Canada's past and present.
Further to the south you will find the Niagara Falls, and to the north, the Muskoka region and its surroundings, which boast pristine natural beauty.
All of these measures, and many more, make Ontario what foreigners consider to be the quintessential Canada.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited in their natural state.
For a population comparison that surprises more than one: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even a continent in its own right, when it comes to fauna.
Most of the small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known for being luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought the practice of Islam to the land, and this religion spread widely throughout the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered the Cape Route linking Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
For women: It is recommended that any woman travelling declare that she is married, regardless of her marital status.
It is also advisable to wear a wedding ring (which should not look too expensive.
Women need to realise that some cultural differences can lead to behaviour that they perceive as harassment – it is common, for example, for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting male advances, and don’t be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that doesn’t mean it’s acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who had destroyed and then rebuilt it, naming it Casa Branca, finally abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name Daru l-Badya, and it was later renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco for shopping.
Around the old medina, it is easy to find places where you can buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and all sorts of trinkets, but this is all aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the extreme east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, particularly the downtown area.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any travel outside of Goma should be researched to understand the state of ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The town is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as for tracking treks with mountain gorillas, which are among the cheapest in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get around in Goma. The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for far-off, exotic lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites due to the threat of desert sands.
This was one of the main stages of Henry Louis Gates's "Wonders of the African World" series on PBS.
The city contrasts strongly with the cities in the rest of the country, as it has a style that is more Arab than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, with Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River forms the southern border.
The total surface area of the park is 19,500 km², which is divided into 14 ecozones, each of which is home to a specific fauna.
It is one of the most well-known amusement parks in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily entrance and conservation fees for the park.
It may be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card, which grants access to certain parks in South Africa, as well as all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the Hong Kong territory and represents the main point of interest for many tourists.
The row of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a glittering bar graph, which is reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To admire the most beautiful panoramas of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the waterfront of Kowloon located across from it.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the land reclaimed from the north shore.
This is the place the British settlers invested in, so it seems to me a good starting point if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site; the part of the forest located on Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, forests are not only made up of mangrove swamps: they also contain some of the last remnants of the majestic jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which approximately one third is covered in water/swamps.
Sundarbans has been a nature reserve since 1966, and you can find around 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer there.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (located on the other side) throughout the day, but most, particularly those serving the east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 in the morning.
Inter-district buses are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are serviced by small Japanese ferries, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Collective taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers stand at a height of 83 metres; it is 378 metres long and has two lanes 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the largest indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing subsistence agriculture.
Other indigenous tribes that inhabited the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, survived mainly through fishing, hunting, or gathering.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, once nicknamed "the giant province of the Indies," was born from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous populations.
The Spanish inaugurated the period of colonisation, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and some of the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
In addition, smaller tournaments and matches are sometimes organized here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check out the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is a commonly accepted currency throughout the islands, while in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the nearby islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currencies may be; speak to the owners in advance to agree on a method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange money from the Falkland Islands outside of the islands, so exchange it before leaving the islands.
As Montevideo is located south of the Equator, winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone, and summer temperatures exceeding 30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are not really any “rainy” and “dry” seasons: precipitation is more or less constant throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are accustomed to seeing humans, they are still wild animals; please do not feed or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, you must stay at least 100 metres away from bears and wolves, and 25 metres away from all other wild animals!
As docile as they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don’t keep a safe distance. These animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Additionally, be aware that odours attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking odorous foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu and home to just under 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk, with the exception of a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
The supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful rally held in the city during the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement.
There are many beaches in Auckland, as the city is situated on two harbours, the most popular of which are located in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the chic suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches, which are sometimes very popular with families, have many shops along the coastline, and swimming is safe there.
The main local beer is “Number One”, a fairly ordinary beer, but tasty and refreshing. There is also another local beer, “Manta”.
There are plenty of French wines to sample, but New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
You can drink the local tap water safely, but you can easily find bottled water if you have any concerns about it.
For Australians, the concept of a "flat white" is foreign; a short black is an "espresso", a cappuccino is filled with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is in line with Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Numerous trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries due to one of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nonetheless, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, north of 1770, box jellyfish come close to beaches and river estuaries. They can also sometimes be seen outside of this period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans; most of them are afraid of humans and would avoid them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their main habitat is in the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind knowing that they will have a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation, such as camping sites, through travel agencies.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even packages that combine the flight and accommodation.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other necessary documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
Any modifications or requests must, however, be addressed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of attendees choose to camp on site, and many consider it an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the musical event, you will need to arrive early to secure a good spot for camping.
Remember that even if the music shows on the main stages are over, other music shows can continue until late at night at other festival venues.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the north of the Baltic Sea in winter, be sure to check the location of the cabins, as crossing the ice can cause unbearable noise levels near the most exposed cabins.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time spent in the city, and cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos generally make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money spent by customers; windows and clocks are rarely present, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer special deals on food, drinks, and entertainment in order to keep guests happy and on the premises.
In some venues, locals offer free alcoholic drinks. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know that it is crucial to remain sober.
Anyone driving to high latitudes or crossing mountain passes should be prepared for snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the level of friction is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a short period of time to trap you.
Visibility may also be limited by falling snow or sleet, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and traffic is virtually uninterrupted all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most memorable moment for many visitors.
In everyday language, the term "safari" refers to an excursion on African soil, particularly in the savannah, with the aim of observing the stunning spectacle of wild animals in their natural habitat.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to come close to cars, and standard equipment makes it easy to observe them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bushwalk", "walking safari" or "footing") involves hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events taking place in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend through July 2020, the date the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with typical tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
By ironing wet clothes, they can dry more easily. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that can be borrowed, even if they are not in the rooms.
If you don't have an iron or don't feel like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if you have one.
Avoid letting the fabric overheat (which can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some locations, you only need to boil the water for a minute; in others, you need to boil it for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have concerns, you should consider buying your water from a reputable bottled water company.
Travellers may encounter pests they are not familiar with in their home region.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritation or, in the most serious cases, trigger allergic reactions, spread venom or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people through force, are generally not considered parasites.
In some locations, duty-free shops offer an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travellers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, particularly on products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, frequently passing through remote areas of the countryside.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep an open mind: steep slopes, narrow roads, and tight curves are common.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in the previous and subsequent sections – typically 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to them is even more important than before.
On the other hand, the mobile service is curiously much stronger here than in many other parts of the route, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbour Austria.
Fruit pastries are common there: apples are cooked and used in pastries all year round, while cherries and plums make an appearance in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and popular cakes often pair particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but hearty pastries, try the Berlin balls, also known as Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be "solid" or "liquid", depending on the amount of sauce it contains.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With Indonesia consisting of 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when this term is used without further qualification, it tends to refer to foods from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a range of simply seasoned dishes, with the dominant flavours favoured by the Javanese being peanuts, chilli, sugar (particularly Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are footrests for the rider's feet, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability for the user, but they can pose a safety issue: the user's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has one foot caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse runs off. To minimise this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a fairly narrow, smooth sole.
Then, some saddles, particularly English ones, have safety bars that allow a rider to fall off the saddle if they are pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley – The premier destination for rock climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many large granite walls and cliffs.
From the summits, the panoramas of the mountains are breathtaking. Alpinists from all over the world keep discovering new paths to climb on the slopes, where the possibilities are endless.
Downhill winter sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down a snowy slope with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes referred to as “ski bums”, who organize their entire vacations around skiing in specific locations.
The idea of skiing is very old: some cave paintings showing skiers date back 5,000 years BC!
The practice of alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century; the first recreational ski club was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegians.
Ski hiking: this activity is also known as Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or ski touring.
It resembles alpine touring skiing, as well as mountaineering, without generally incorporating those activities, which are practiced on rugged terrain and require the use of much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a similar hiking route.
Under good conditions, you can cover a bit more distance than on foot – but you will very rarely achieve the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but one that comprises many independent countries, so in typical circumstances, traveling through several countries means having to apply for several visas and undergo several passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, operates somewhat like a single country in this regard.
As long as you remain within this zone, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control points again.
Likewise, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each of the member countries in the area, which saves time, money, and administrative hassle.
There is no universal definition for determining whether a manufactured object is an antique; some tax authorities define goods that are more than 100 years old as antiques.
The criteria vary depending on the location; in some parts of the world, such as North America, the age limit may be lower than in Europe.
Handmade products may be considered antiques, even if they are less old than similar industrial products.
Reindeer husbandry is an important means of subsistence for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding this trade is of great importance to many other professions.
Even though, according to tradition, not all Samis were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, they lived off fishing, hunting, and other similar activities, while using reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Nowadays, many Sámi people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
Although it is widely used, particularly among non-Roms, the term “Gitan” is often considered pejorative due to its association with negative stereotypes and a distorted image of the Roma people.
If the country you are travelling to is subject to a travel warning issued by your government, this may affect your health insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
You can also seek advice from other governments, but their advice is tailored to their own citizens.
As an example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Opinions are just a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Violent weather is the generic term for any dangerous meteorological phenomenon that may cause damage, serious social upheaval or loss of human life.
Very unfavourable weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they can be of various types, depending on geographical, topographical, and atmospheric features.
Violent winds, hail, excessive rainfall and fires are forms and effects of violent weather, just like thunderstorms, tornadoes, sea squalls and cyclones.
Extreme, regional and seasonal weather phenomena include cold snaps, snowstorms with high winds, and sand or dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to research the risks of bad weather that may affect their destination region, as this may have an impact on the routes they plan to take.
Anyone planning to travel to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
A search on the internet for "Courses in hostile environments" will probably provide the address of a local company.
A course would normally cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
Training normally lasts between 2 and 5 days and includes role-playing exercises, a lot of first aid training, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on survival in the wilderness are common, but publications on war zones are few and far between.
Travellers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have valid documentation for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with a gender designation of "X" or to update documents to match a person's preferred name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents is equally variable.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Transsexual people in the pre-operative phase should not have to expect to go through scanners while preserving their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are the currents that return from the waves breaking on the beach, often on a reef or similar feature.
Due to the submarine topography, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a rapid current towards deep waters can form there.
In most cases, deaths are due to exhaustion resulting from an attempt to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be caught again. Depending on your skills and whether or not you have been spotted, you may also want to wait for rescue.
The reintegration shock occurs earlier than the cultural shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had trouble adjusting to a new culture sometimes have a lot of trouble readjusting to their home culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and have lost some of the habits of your original culture.
At first, when you went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country have to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually, you can always hear the noise of tourists and vendors. The story of the sound and light show is like a history book.
The Sphinx is placed as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations, sixteen of which are active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula, and the island of King George, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples include Livingston and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge with the plateau, then reappear to form the Ellsworth mountain range, which is 360 km long and crossed by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, includes the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches a height of 4892 m.
In remote areas without cellular phone networks, you may have no choice but to use satellite telephony.
A satellite phone generally does not replace a mobile phone, as you need to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite in order to make a call.
This service is often used by shipping, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that have remote data transmission and telephone needs.
Your local phone operator should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
Those planning a sabbatical year have the option of learning while travelling, and more and more of them are choosing this option.
This formula is particularly popular among young people who have left school, as it allows them to take a year off before university without compromising their studies.
Often, having taken a gap year abroad can actually give you a better chance of going to university in your home country.
As a rule, there is a registration fee to participate in these educational programs.
Finland is a popular destination for pleasure boating: the "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagoes and on the lakes.
While the coastal archipelagos and the larger lakes are indeed large enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from that it is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in forty).
Most cruises on the Baltic Sea feature an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a few full days while returning to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only go ashore on cruise excursions, you won’t need a separate visa (as of 2009).
The city of Berlin, Germany, is mentioned in some brochures for cruises. As you can see by consulting the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea at all, and no visit to this city is included in the price of the cruise.
Flying on a plane can be a scary experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
There is no need to be ashamed of this: it is no different from the fears and anxieties that many people experience in relation to other things.
For some, understanding something about how planes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or a lack of control.
Transport companies are well compensated for making fast deliveries, and in the case of urgent repairs, the issue of timeframes is crucial for the documents, goods or spare parts involved.
On some routes, large companies have their own planes, but on other routes and for smaller companies, there has been a problem.
If they had sent goods by air freight, on certain routes, it would have taken days to clear customs and unload the cargo.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked luggage, airline regulations wouldn't allow them to send luggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The most obvious way to travel in first or business class is to pay a lot of money for the privilege (or, better yet, have your company pay for it).
However, it's not cheap: as a rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class, and eleven times for first class!
In general, it is pointless to try to get discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know full well that they can count on a certain type of traveler who is willing to pay a premium for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they price their tickets accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is very common.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that suffers from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but recognised by no country that is a member of the United Nations.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
With a population of 3.7 million, Izmir is Turkey's third-largest city, the second-largest port after Istanbul, and an excellent hub.
What was the ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, developed and lively commercial centre, set around a vast bay, surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glassy buildings, and modern shopping centers are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, a 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that is more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and is home to an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves on some of the graves.
It is worth taking a half-hour stroll around this fascinating village.
The romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, located to the north, is easily accessible and has become famous among foreigners thanks to Lord Byron's vivid account of its splendour.
The Scotturb bus 403 regularly travels to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
When you head north, be sure to visit the magnificent sanctuary of Notre-Dame de Fatima (temple), a site known worldwide for the apparitions of Mary.
Remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave, as well as a site that holds almost incalculable significance for a large portion of the world's population.
There are still many women and men alive who survived their time here, and many others who saw their loved ones murdered or killed through forced labor, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the site by marking or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understands it, and practically everyone is able to speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as the law establishes that this is the first official language.
Still, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unexpected disruptions are announced by an automated system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
While this stereotype is often inaccurate, the best way to get along in Paris is to behave as well as possible, to act like someone who is well-mannered – this will make your travels much easier.
The abrupt exterior demeanor of Parisians quickly evaporates if you show a minimum of courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely wooded, mainly with beech, fir and pine trees, and features a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The country has a wide variety of plant communities due to the diversity of its microclimates, soils, and altitude levels.
The region is also home to a wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie can be seen there, as well as many other common species.
When visiting a monastery, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and have their shoulders covered as well.
Most monasteries provide stoles for women who arrive without one, but if you bring your own, and it has bright colors, you will be greeted with a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men must wear pants that cover their knees.
You can also borrow this garment from stock at the entrance, but since it is not washed after each use, you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. A one-size-fits-all option for men!
The cuisine of Majorca, like that of similar regions in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and makes use of olive oil.
A simple and popular dish, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any condiments available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All names, followed by the word Sie (meaning you), are always capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an excellent way to differentiate between certain verbs and objects.
One could also say that it makes reading easier, although writing can be somewhat complicated by the need to know whether a verb or adjective is being used in a noun form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written
The main letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Also, please make sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" in a distinct manner: "caro" means "dear," while "carro" means "cart."
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introduction to grammar would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand the sentences.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, those who speak a bit of Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is close enough that it doesn’t need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete today, and remain in place as museums or educational sites.
As light pollution was not as much of a concern in their time as it is today, they are generally located in cities or on campuses, making them more accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge infrastructures located in remote areas where the atmospheric conditions are favorable.
Contemplating cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor solely for himself and other members of the close aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look their best when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even just "one."
If you visit a strictly maintained garden, the collection of “specimens” will also result in your being expelled without discussion.
Singapore is generally considered an extremely safe place, where it is very easy to get around, and where you can buy almost everything you need once you arrive.
However, as it is located in the “high tropics” just a few degrees north of the equator, you will need to adapt to the heat (which is always present) and strong sun radiation (when the sky is clear, which is less common).
There are also a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure the bus you are planning to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kyriat Arba.
Inland waterways can be an excellent theme for a holiday.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or taking a cruise to interesting sites on the Danube or boating along the Erie Canal.
They also define the routes for popular hiking trails and bike paths.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with these holidays have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
It is a tradition to spend the Easter night awake in an open place to see the sunrise.
There are of course Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is possible that it is a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold a Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, with congregations often bursting into the party at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All animals that have arrived on these islands have done so originally by water, swimming or on floating objects, or by air.
Due to the great distance that separates them from the mainland, mammals were unable to complete the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal of the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, numerous mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you can experience polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to admire the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark for almost the entire day.
As the regions are sparsely populated, and light pollution is therefore often not an issue, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be accustomed to.
The costumes are classic work outfits, and employees are addressed by their family name or by their job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, as it emphasizes collective effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often need to get approval from their superiors for any decision they make and are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
