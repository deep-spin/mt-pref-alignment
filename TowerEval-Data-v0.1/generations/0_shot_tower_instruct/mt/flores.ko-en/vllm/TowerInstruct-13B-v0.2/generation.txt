This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a well-known theory, but also provides details that are usually lacking in fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the top of the dinosaur's feathers were a tawny brown and the bottom was light or yellowish.
Such a finding also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Dinosaur feathers lack well-developed quills, called vanes, but have other distinctive feather features such as barbules and small barbules, and researchers have speculated that these other features evolved later into quills.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were used for temperature regulation and display, rather than flight. The researchers examined samples from the tail of a juvenile dinosaur and said they were not baby down, but adult dinosaur feathers.
This is the tail of a young dinosaur, but the researchers say that the sample shows it is not the down of a young bird, but the feathers of an adult.

Although it relies heavily on theory, the program is designed to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for could have been caused by the cohesive force between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a gravitational pull on Earth, causing the tides, the Milky Way exerts a gravitational pull on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around galaxies is located around the galaxy like a halo, and is made up of a large number of small particles.

Dr Tony Moll found XDR-TB (extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
He told the interview that the new variant is "very deadly, very transmissible and very frightening."
Dr Moll believes some patients may have been infected with the disease in hospital, and at least two of them were believed to be healthy hospital workers.
Over the course of a year, one infected person is likely to infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
But the proportion of all TB patients with XDR-TB is not that high. If you take a particular moment in South Africa, when there are 330,000 people with TB, then about 6,000 of them have XDR-TB.

Voting in France is traditionally a low-tech experience. Voters are isolated in booths, slipping pre-printed sheets of paper into envelopes indicating their candidate.
After the poll worker confirms the voter's identity, the voter deposits the ballot in the ballot box and signs the poll book.
French electoral law, on the other hand, codifies the procedure strictly.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes have been made transparent so that voters and supervisors can see that there are no other envelopes in the box at the start of voting, and that the box contains only the envelopes of certified voters, which have been counted legally.
Candidates may send representatives to observe the entire process of the election. In the evening, volunteers under strict supervision count the votes according to specific procedures.

She is in custody awaiting charges and trial, but her reputation is so widely known that witness testimony may have been skewed.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish law is different and the court considered the publication of the photographs to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, of Dundee University, said: "If journalists publish pictures of suspects, they are walking a tightrope.
The Crown Office, which is responsible for overall prosecutions, suggested to reporters that there would be no further comment until at least after the charges.
According to leaked information, the document would relate to the border disputes that Palestine wants based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics reportedly include the future of the holy city of Jerusalem and the Jordan Valley, which are both considered sacred by both countries.
Israel demanded that the current forces in the area remain for 10 years after the agreement is reached, and the PA agreed that the forces would leave after five years.
Hunters who took part in the additional pest control trials had to be closely supervised by forestry officials because they were overseeing the trials and assessing their effectiveness.
The partnership with NPWS and the Australian Sports Shooters Association saw the recruitment of qualified volunteers to undertake the Association's hunting program.
The four shooters selected for the first culling operation had all received comprehensive safety and training instruction, according to acting Parks and Wildlife Service director of parks conservation and heritage Mike O'Connell.
Martelly yesterday took the oath of office for a nine-member provisional electoral council (CEP).
This is the fifth CEP for Mattel in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of measures to prepare for new elections.
The commission was set up in response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
Some violent resistance movements were triggered because some elections have not been held since 2011.
About 60 incidents of iPod overheating have been reported, with a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the equipment.
Last week, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had reported an additional 34 cases of overheating incidents, which it said were "not serious."
"The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said it was "really regrettable" that Apple postponed the release of its report."
The quake struck the Mariana Islands at 7.19am local time (9.19pm GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management said no damage was reported across the commonwealth.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer hijacked a bus in the Philippine capital of Manila and took Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired an M-16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages were rescued and at least six were confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, along with the Filipino photographers.
Later, when an elderly woman needed to use the bathroom, the photographers took her place, and Mendoza was shot.
Rigins followed in his father's footsteps and went into medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and gynaecologist and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Working at the hospital, Donghan Rigins began to research early labor pains in his free time.
His research showed that when hormones were administered, the lungs of the fetus matured more quickly.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators retrieved two flight data recorders, or black boxes, on Wednesday.
Other fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tammy Driessens said: "Luna was the original Queen of Extreme, she was my first manager and she left this world on a night with two moons, just like her, very special, she was a strong woman."
Dustin "Gold Dust" Rhodes said, "Luna was as bizarre as me... maybe even more so... I love her and I'm going to miss her... I hope she's gone to a better place."
A survey of 1,400 people ahead of the 2010 federal election found opposition to Australia becoming a republic had risen 8 per cent since 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic when the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ends.
A poll found 34 per cent wanted Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
In the poll, 29 per cent of respondents said Australia should become a republic soon, while 31 per cent said Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and the Commonwealth Games relay but her illness is suspected to have sapped her strength.
The medication needed to overcome the pain was a banned substance in the competition, so he couldn’t take it.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number as of Jan. 25.
Several people had demonstrated the discovery using various hardware and software by early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water delivery to Earth, along with organic materials that make up proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, because a comet collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed legislation legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He referred to the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense."
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that allows planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel and reducing carbon emissions each year.
This allows air traffic controllers to identify aircraft with a very high degree of accuracy using satellite-based technology, rather than the previous ground-based radar technology, providing pilots with more accurate information.
At Wembley, there will be no additional transport provision or surface train stops, and there will be no surface parking or public transport interchange parking.
The lack of public transportation has raised concerns that the game may be held without spectators.
A study published in the journal Science last Thursday announced the formation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Although researchers from Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden reported the emergence of a new species in just two generations, the process is thought to have taken much longer because of interbreeding between the local Darwin's finches, the medium ground finch, the immigrant cactus finch and the large ground finch.
Gold can be processed into all kinds of shapes, and even very small shapes can be rolled.
It can be cut with a thin line, bent or twisted. It can be hammered or said with a sheet.
"Gold can be made very thin and can be stuck to other metals. It can be made very thin, so it was used to decorate the hand-drawn illustrations in books called ""illuminated manuscripts.""
This is called the pH of the chemical, and can be made into a scale using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is a measure of the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in a chemical substance.
The hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost its electron. (A hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron.)
After mixing the two dry powders, use wet, clean hands to knead the mixture into a ball.
The moisture in your hands reacts with the outer layer, giving it a fun texture and forming a sort of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had almost every house connected to a sophisticated sewerage system with flush toilets.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in houses in the Greek cities of Santorini and Crete Minoa.
Toilets were also present in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, which were used by both sexes.
If you're talking to someone thousands of kilometers (miles) away, you're using a satellite.
Satellites in space receive the signal and then reflect it back down almost immediately.
Satellites are launched into space by rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and vision.
To put a satellite or telescope in space, you need a super-sized rocket that's more than 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world in ways that are almost unimaginable. The biggest change it brought was the provision of a more convenient and faster means of transportation.
It brought trains and cars and all sorts of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized animals such as rabbits, hares, and deer, and medium-sized carnivores such as foxes.
Finally, there are many smaller cats (including domestic cats allowed to roam free) that eat much smaller prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their secret to success is a special thing that each cat has that prevents competition from other cats, the concept of niche.
Lions are the most social of the cat family, living in prides.
A group consists of one to three adult male conspecifics and as many as 30 females and their offspring.
Females come mainly from large extended families with many sisters and daughters, so they have close relationships with each other.
Lions behave in a way that is remarkably similar to a pack of wolves or dogs (but not other large canids), which is also extremely deadly to prey.
Tigers are like versatile athletes (not very good at anything, but) they can climb high, swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a human.
Tigers are a group with lions, leopards, and jaguars. Only these four big cats are able to roar.
The roar of a tiger is different from the deep growl of a lion, but it is similar to the snarling, hissing sentence of words.
Ocelots are fond of small animals, and will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds that are much smaller than themselves whenever possible.
Scientists think that orcas use smell to hunt and find their prey, by smelling where they have been.
Ocelots have large eyes that allow them to see well in the dark, and they move very cautiously. Ocelots hunt by stalking prey in a crouched position, blending into their surroundings.
When a small group of organisms is separated from the main group from which they originated (by being moved to a mountain range or river, or by being moved to a new island where they cannot easily move), they often realize that they are in a different environment than where they were before.
Because these new environments have different resources and competitors than the old ones, new populations need different traits or adaptations to be competitive.
The original population has not changed at all, but still requires the same adaptation.
As time went on and new people started to adapt to the new environment, I started to look more and more like everyone else.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups would look so different that they could not be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence of evolution and is a crucial part of it every week.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and consume the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make their own food through photosynthesis using the sun, and they also provide shade.
We build our houses from wood and make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is vegetables. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so there was nothing to fear except other mosasaurs.
The elongated jaw was filled with more than 70 very sharp teeth, and these teeth were present in the roof of the mouth, meaning that no one could pass in front of it and escape.
It's not clear, but it may have had a split tongue. It fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and possibly even human flesh.
This animal also attacked anything that came into the water, and was so fierce that even giant dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus couldn't take it on.
Their food was mostly familiar to us, but among the Roman banquet fare were some unusual and exotic items such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and dormice.
Another difference was that the poor and women ate while seated on chairs, while the wealthy men preferred to recline on couches while dining together.
An ancient Roman meal could not have included foods from the Americas or Asia, which arrived in Europe only centuries later.
For example, they didn't eat corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which they considered the "house of the god."
People would bring offerings to the gods, and priests would try to meet the gods' demands through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes called ziggurats, these special pyramid-shaped towers were built to be part of a temple.
The very top of the tower is a special sanctuary for the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
The life of the Hebrew family was almost entirely outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard, shops were just stalls on the street, and stones were used to build houses.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely settled. In Norse sagas, they say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he sailed further west, he discovered Greenland and named it.
Regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country belonged to the "Scandinavian" group, there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you may think that there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. Even if there's something written on the back of the paper, it's not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence is written 'Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776.' This is written upside down at the bottom of the document."
No one knows who wrote it, but this large parchment document (75.6 cm x 62.2 cm) was rolled up and stored away.
So it's likely that they were simply labeled.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south remained unfree.
"There was the Vichy France, which was under the control of the French who chose to make a pact with Germany in 1940, who were more collaborators than fighters against the invaders."
"On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, an operation known as 'Operation Dragoon.'"
Just two weeks later, the Americans and Free French had liberated southern France and were turning north towards Germany.
Civilization is a very large group of people working and living together, sharing a single culture, that is, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning "citizenly," civis, meaning "citizen," and civitas, meaning "city" or "city-state," and defines the scale of society.
The city-states can be considered the precursors of the nation. Civilization culture means the inheritance of knowledge over generations, the survival of cultural footprints and the fair distribution of them.
Many minor cultures disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and are not treated as full-fledged civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states formed a weak central government with a Congress as the only component, according to the Articles of Confederation.
Because Congress had no power of taxation, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, enforcement of the law often had to be left to the uncooperative state authorities.
Also, Congress had no power to invalidate state tax laws and tariffs.
These clauses required unanimous consent from all states to be amended, and state delegates who ignored the central government mostly stayed away from the convention.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, along with the German national football team, and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, baseball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the north, and Italian athletes occasionally compete in international events and the Olympics.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the world's 7th largest island!
"Japan is often referred to as the ""archipelago"" due to the cluster/group of islands it has in its geographical position."
Taiwan got its name from the 15th-century European sailors who called the island Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, which led to changes in the way crops were produced, and they employed Chinese workers to produce rice and sugar through re-sowing agriculture.
In 1683, the armies of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and in 1885 declared Taiwan a territory of the Qing Empire.
After losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan and allowed Japan to govern the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures: the Intiwatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge have been reconstructed to better allow tourists to understand the original appearance.
In 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu was restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image format in the world is 35 mm, which was the film size used primarily at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been carried over to the image sensor format of digital cameras.
It’s a bit confusing, but the 35mm format is actually 36mm wide by 24mm high.
So the aspect ratio of this format (divided by 12 to get the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format) have the same or very similar aspect ratio.
Often ridiculed and overused, the rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining the order of the image.
This law states that the most effective position to place the main subject is at the point where the lines dividing the image into thirds both vertically and horizontally intersect (see example).
During this period of European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church was under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity bound the nations of Europe together in a common faith, despite differences in language and custom.
Its pervasive power affects everyone from the king to the commoner.
According to one of the main tenets of Christianity, wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's treasury funds exist, in part, for that reason.
The church's core power has remained in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has raised questions about the legitimacy of the doctrine.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
Although these blockades violate international law, generally accepted by several international conventions of the last two centuries, this strategy has proven effective in blocking important military and civilian supplies.
The UK has mined the high seas to prevent any ships from entering whole ocean areas, putting neutral ships at risk.
Because the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response in unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing mood among most citizens and states was pacifism and isolationism.
After the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations prayed that they would never again experience such a situation.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to get a job with Edison's company in New York City.
He arrived in America with a letter of recommendation from his former boss, Charles Batchelor, a copy of his wedding certificate, and four cents, his entire fortune.
In ancient China, there was a unique way of indicating different eras, where each era or the family holding power in China was distinguished as a dynasty.
There were also periods of division into several regions and instability between each dynasty. The most well-known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Qin dynasties.
During this period, there were fierce wars between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in battles to sit atop the highest seat in the Xian palace.
The use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, and the emergence of nationalism and the idea that a nation belongs to its people rather than to a single ruler all had significant social and political effects.
Also, after the revolution, jobs were opened up to all male applicants, paving the way for the most ambitious and success-driven people to succeed.
The same applies to the military, because instead of military ranks based on hierarchy, ranks are now based on indicators of current ability.
The French Revolution also inspired the working classes in other countries, who were oppressed, to rise up in revolution themselves.
Muhammad was deeply concerned with matters beyond this worldly life. He often used a cave known as Hira on Mount Noor, "Light," for meditation.
The cave, which has withstood the test of time, is a very clear expression of Muhammad's religious inclinations.
Perched on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if you know it exists, it's not easy to find it: once you're inside the cave, you're completely isolated.
There is nothing to see but the clear and beautiful sky surrounding the mountain. In this cave, the outside world cannot be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the only Seven Wonders of the World that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many huge pyramid structures built to honour the dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Sphinx."
The pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Kufu, and the smaller pyramids and tombs and temples were built to honor Kufu's wives and family.
The "upstroke" mark looks like a V and the "downstroke" mark looks like a stylized square without a bottom or a staple.
The upstroke is the movement that starts at the end of the bow and draws the bowstring, while the downstroke is the movement that starts at the bowstring and releases the bowstring.
Flats usually sound softer, while sharps sound stronger and more confident.
You can mark it with a pencil, but the bow markings are there for musical purposes, so they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI of France, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis Charles) and the king's sister, Princess Elizabeth, were forcibly removed from Versailles to Paris by a mob of female workers on October 6, 1789.
The king and queen returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by crowds shouting and threatening them.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage.
At one point, a member of the mob waved the severed head of the royal bodyguard who had been killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The cost of the American imperialist war of conquest in the Philippines was paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to pay off a significant portion of their expenses, and bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks attracted interest.
Of course, the super-profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people will form a basic part of the interests of US imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, we must understand the circumstances that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which the events took place is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages, which corresponds to the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD) in European history.
The Late Middle Ages, which precedes the Early Middle Ages and connects it, is conventionally considered to end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of practical ideas, from technological determinism or technological imperative to the precise sense that human destiny is moved by fundamental logic associated with the expression of scientific laws and techniques.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism have two concepts: that technological development itself exerts more influence than culture or politics, and that technology is not socially controlled, but rather has an ""essential impact"" on society."
For example, someone might argue that cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, since the national road network is not economically feasible with only a few cars, new production methods will be developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Furthermore, as more people own vehicles, the rate of road accidents increases, which in turn leads to new technological advancements in the medical field to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had many elements of cultural determinism, influenced by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
From the Romantic point of view, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and cultures grew up around that geography, which were socially harmonious, and which were better than arbitrary laws imposed by the state.
While Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern era, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
The city's reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
In the 12th century, Constantinople's status declined, mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts of more valuable silks and spices than the Byzantine merchants could sell.
At this time, the fashion capital moved from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style was prevalent between the 10th and 11th centuries and reached its peak in the 14th century.
Initially, the dress was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
But because of the slow exchange of information, the western style could be 25 to 30 years behind.
Late medieval Europe begins to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of the time as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture that is carried out by agricultural specialists and their families to produce only as much food as they need.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, organic system that uses locally adapted seeds through crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and it is still prevalent in many developing countries.
Subcultures allow people who feel alienated from mainstream society to come together and develop their own identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
Subcultures are characterized by a distinctive set of linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, and geographical features, and may be a combination of these.
Members of subcultures often identify themselves through a unique and symbolic style, which may include fashion, mannerisms, and specific slang.
One of the most common ways of demonstrating the importance of socialization is to use the case of a few unfortunate children who, for reasons of neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse by adults, have not been socialized during their growth.
These children are called "wild children." Some wild children are confined, often by their parents, who cannot accept the child's severe intellectual or physical defects.
A child who is abandoned or runs away may have experienced severe abuse or trauma.
Some children were said to have been raised by animals, while others lived in the wild on their own.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, wild children exhibit behaviors that are almost entirely like those of animals that require special care, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, and scaffolding takes it one step further.
Scaffolding is more of an assistant than a learning method. For example, it helps people learn new things, such as using the latest computer programs or starting a new project.
The scaffold can be both virtual and real, which is to say, the teacher is a form of scaffold, but also a little paper clip person in Microsoft Office, if you will.
The virtual structure is built into the software and is designed to prompt, prompt and explain procedures that might be difficult for a student to handle on their own.
The reasons why a child is placed in care are wide-ranging, from neglect to abuse, even kidnapping.
Every child should grow up in a nurturing, protective and educational environment, but this is not the case.
We see the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system will provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care must be able to provide all the essential elements that were not met in the original home.
The Internet has both collective communication and person-to-person communication elements.
The distinctive nature of the Internet leads to additional dimensions in terms of use and satisfaction approaches.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" have been proposed as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Amey and McQuail (1998) identified 'personal involvement' and 'ongoing relationship' as new motivational dimensions in their study of audience responses to websites.
By using video recordings, they made a crucial discovery about the interpretation of tiny facial expressions and movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, they claim to be able to accurately interpret subtle facial expressions to detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks showed in his book "The President's Speech" that people correctly perceived the sincerity contained in it, even though they could not understand the speech due to brain damage.
He even suggested that animals like dogs have this ability to analyze human behavior.
Research in the 20th century has identified two groups of genetic variants that are either hidden or revealed.
Mutations create new species' genes, and selection removes the expressed genes from the pool.
Recombination and separation shuffle the mutations that have occurred between the two gene pools in each generation.
In savannas, primates with human-like digestive systems have a hard time meeting their amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
Moreover, its failure leads to serious consequences: impaired growth function, malnutrition, and, eventually, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources are the proteins in leaves or legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest without cooking.
In contrast, animal foods such as ants, termites, and eggs are not only easily digested, but also provide high-quality protein containing essential amino acids.
"All things considered, it's not surprising that our ancestors solved the 'protein problem' in the same way that chimpanzees in savannahs do today."
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking someone up during their normal sleep period and then letting them fall back asleep after a short period of time (10–60 minutes).
This can be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you and allowing you to regain consciousness.
If you turn off your alarm clock during sleep, you can put the clock in a far corner of the room and make yourself get out of bed to turn it off.
Other circadian rhythm-based options include drinking a large amount of water (especially tea, which is known as a diuretic or water pill) before bedtime and forcing yourself to urinate.
The amount of calmness a person carries is inversely related to the amount of anxiety inherent in his body and soul.
The less tension there is, the more positive energy will be released into your life. Everyone has the ability to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can attain enlightenment, and the only obstacle to this goal is our own inner insecurity and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has expanded to incorporate many of the ideas of love in Mahayana Buddhism and many of the techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in theory: it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of love that embraces all.
Kundalini yoga awakens the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga, which involves visualizing various deities to cleanse energy channels, activate chakras, and create a state of enlightenment.
In World War II, Germany was a common enemy, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the end of the war, the clash of systems, changes, and cultures led to the decline of many countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
The Cold War would continue for the next 40 years and become a proxy fight in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, Polish defences had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat along the Romanian bridgehead and regroup.
However, these plans became almost useless overnight when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers invaded eastern Poland after violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties (bilateral and multilateral) and entered the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
Shipping is the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and large volumes of goods across the oceans.
The Navy's mission is traditionally to help the nation move people and goods around, but at the same time to prevent the enemy from doing so.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, where the Americans tried to move men and resources across the Atlantic to help the British.
At the same time, the German navy, which mainly used U-boats, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany could have conquered Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goat domestication probably began about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient civilizations and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, wool, meat and leather.
Goats are usually kept in herds on hillsides or grazing lands, and are tended by goatherds, often children or young people better known as herdsmen, a method of herding that is still used today.
The macadam road was built in England in the early 16th century.
The macadam road was just made of parallel wooden planks, but it allowed horses to go faster and pull more weight than the rougher roads of the time.
Sleeper blocks were introduced quite early to secure the tracks, but it was gradually discovered that it was more efficient to have the tracks on top of the iron sleeper blocks.
This became common practice, but iron wore out the wooden wheels of the carriages more quickly.
As time went on, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels, and in 1767, the first railway made entirely of iron was introduced.
The first means of transportation known to mankind was walking, and 2 million years ago, Homo erectus appeared, and mankind began to walk upright.
Their ancestor, Australopithecus, did not habitually walk upright like them.
Sahelanthropus may have walked upright 7 million years ago, but the hallmarks of bipedalism are well-established in the fossils of Australopithecus, which appeared between 4.2 and 3.9 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join environmental movements, and we can become activists to reduce the suffering of the future.
In many cases, this is similar to symptomatic treatment, but if you do not want to stop at a temporary solution, you need to find the source of the problem and deactivate it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot with the development of science and technology of human beings, and the problems have become more serious because of the overpopulation and the luxurious lifestyle of human beings.
After Congress adopted it on July 4, Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson signed and wrote out a copy on parchment, which they sent to John Dunlap's printing office a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies of what is now called the Dunlap Broadside were produced.
On July 8, the first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the front yard of the Independence Memorial Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document; the original manuscript no longer exists.
Today, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of birds as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still many things that make birds look like dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a tyrannosaurus.
Most computers in use today use a method of manipulating information through binary coding.
Binary numbers can only have one of two values (i.e., 0 or 1), and these numbers are referred to as binary numbers or bits in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not show symptoms immediately. Symptoms such as vomiting are so common that they cannot be diagnosed immediately.
The most obvious sign of poisoning is if you have left a container of medicine or a household chemical open.
Check the table for specific first aid instructions for certain poisons.
The term bug is used by entomologists to refer to this group of insects.
The term is derived from the bed bug, a parasitic insect that has been known to man since ancient times.
Both bed bugs and chiggers are chronic insects that adapt to the habitat or dwelling of their host.
Multiple sclerosis (MS), the most common neurological disease in young adults and middle-aged adults, is reported to have about 400,000 cases across the United States.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Women are twice as likely to get multiple sclerosis as men, according to a new study.
Couples may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interest or in the best interest of the child.
These couples may choose to adopt a baby.
In the adoption process, the birth parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which drives most scientific research.
But experimentation is about eliminating one or more hypotheses, asking questions, making observations, and leading to scientific inquiry.
Philologists or philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
In science, including psychology, Aristotle's view of all matter was accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West became disconnected from the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are critically dependent on the presence of endogenous circadian cycles through the biological clock.
For most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, the circadian rhythm is recorded, not simply a response to external cycle signals.
The biological clock is a self-sustained oscillator that can continue to run cycles on its own, even in the absence of external signals.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the leading studies to suggest that DNA was the genetic material.
Hersh and Chase used phages or viruses to insert bacteria into their DNA.
They did two experiments, one to confirm the presence of DNA within the pads when radioactive and the other to confirm the presence of proteins in the pads when radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism based on nature is attracting people interested in nature tours to appreciate the landscape, including plant and animal wildlife.
Examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and research on parks and ecosystems.
One example is the travel, photos, and learning about Orangutan in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave their small rural towns in their cars to go to work, passing by other people on their way to work, who have just left where they were.
This dynamic shuttle system in some way connects and supports everyone's car-based transportation system.
Now scientific data shows that this massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of the stable state that helped human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation system, and almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaint about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transport systems cause such dissatisfaction, and why do they so often fail to live up to expectations? Are transport engineers all incompetent, or is something more fundamental at work?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because the driver's behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a fairly consistent range, so traffic flow has a certain reasonable consistency and can be roughly described mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships were established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This relationship helps in the planning, design and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects are the first animals that could fly in the air. The ability to fly helped insects to avoid enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back over their bodies.
This provides a wider range of smaller places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are moths and butterflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people believed him to be right when he claimed that the solar system, including the sun (and other stars), revolved around the Earth, but many did not.
At first glance, it seems like the right thing to say, since the Earth feels like it's not moving.
The Amazon River is the second longest river in the world and the largest by volume, carrying more than eight times the amount of water as the second largest river.
Amazon is also the widest river on the planet, sometimes reaching a width of six miles.
20% of the water that flows from the world's rivers to the sea comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River mainstream is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long, and the basin is formed by the confluence of thousands of smaller rivers.
Pyramid building continued until the very end of the Old Kingdom, but the size and technical excellence of the pyramids never again equaled that of the Giza pyramids.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monumental architecture of their ancestors, which was more than 1,000 years old by their standards.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people, making it the smallest independent state and the least populous country in the world.
Italian is the official language of Vatican City for legislation and official communications.
Furthermore, Italian is a vernacular language, spoken by most people who work in the week, unlike Latin, which is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, since ancient times, because they are all found in nature in their native form and can be mined relatively easily with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all matter was made up of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was rather similar to the four states of matter - solid, liquid, gas, and plasma (in that order) - but Aristotle also came up with the theory that they changed into new elements, which made up what we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are a lot of elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metals, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that there are many billions of them in the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil emerged and the pencil has remained a good tool for many people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, pencils have become less used and have been pushed to a less important position.
Now people don't have to write messages on computer screens or even get close to a pencil sharpener.
People are just wondering what the keyboard will look like if something new comes along.
The principle behind the fission bomb is that it requires a lot of energy to bring two nuclei with many protons and neutrons together.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill: when you split a nucleus again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to split apart on their own with even the slightest external influence or no external conditions at all.
"The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the 'crust.'"
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km thick on the far side.
The crust is thinner under Maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more maria closer to the crust because it is thinner, and lava is more likely to rise to the surface.
Content theory focuses on what causes people to engage in certain behaviors or what leads them to engage in those behaviors.
These theories suggest that people have certain drives or needs that are internalized by the time they become adults.
These theories look at certain people who make you want to do what you do and what in your environment makes you do certain things and not others.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
“Typically, two behaviors can emerge as the manager starts leading their former peers. They try to remain ‘one of the guys’ on one end of the spectrum.”
This type of manager makes decisions that are not well received by people, administers discipline, job evaluations, and assigns responsibilities, and has difficulty holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the team becomes a group of unaware individuals who believe that everything the team has done must be changed and done their way.
In the end, the success of the team is the responsibility of the leader.
This behavior creates confusion between the leader and the members of the group.
Virtual teams maintain the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but with subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for real members.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because they can meet with teams according to shifting time zones that local management teams don't understand.
The existence of a "true ""transparent team""" (Larsen and LaPasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of virtual teams.
“The invisible team is the management team that each member reports to, and this team holds each member accountable.”
Why do organizations take so long to go through the process of establishing a learning organization? One goal of putting the concept of organizational learning into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in the work departments of an organization, creativity and originality can flourish.
As a result, the process of working together to overcome obstacles can lead to new innovative processes to meet customer needs.
For an organization to become innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the Continuum approach as a way to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide the necessary physical evidence for theoretical approaches to the study of cognition, narrowing the field and making it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors can affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The advent of new technologies has made it possible to observe and investigate the brain's structure and processes in ways that were previously unimaginable.
This provides a lot of information and data to create simulation models that help us understand the processes in the mind.
AI strongly evokes science fiction, but it is a very important area in computer science, which deals with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of computers.
AI research includes the study of automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
This includes handwriting, voice, and facial recognition, as well as control, planning, scheduling, and answering customer questions and diagnoses.
These have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to problems that arise in real life.
AI systems are now commonly used in the economy, medicine, engineering, and military, as seen in many home computers and video game software.
Field trips are a big part of every classroom, and teachers generally want to take their students to places that don't require a bus trip.
Technology helps with virtual field trips. Students can view museum exhibits, tour aquariums and appreciate beautiful works of art from the comfort of their classroom.
Virtual field trips are a great way to revisit field trips and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year, students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about a state tour, and each year the website is redesigned, with the previous version left online in a scrapbook format.
Blogging also helps students improve their writing. Students often start blogging with poor grammar and spelling, but the presence of readers generally changes those things.
Since most students are the most critical audience, bloggers start trying to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
"Furthermore, blogs ""encourage students to be more aware of their surroundings"" and students make them clever and interesting through the need to capture the attention of an audience (Toth, 2004)."
Blogging is a tool that fosters collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
"Proper use of blogs ""promotes analytical and critical thinking by actively responding to online materials, allowing students to define their position in relation to others' writing and establish their own perspective on a particular topic" (Oravec, 2020)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming capital city where bilingualism is used, and Ottawa's various art galleries and museums shed light on Canada's past and present.
In the south, there are the Niagara Falls, and in the north, there are unexplored natural beauty, such as Muskoka.
All of these things make Ontario stand out as the real Canada to outsiders.
The vast northern areas are sparsely populated, and some areas are almost uninhabited wasteland.
A population comparison that will surprise many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadians.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean along the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is currently the largest and most unique continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent or associated with France and are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
Islam also came through the Arabs, and there were great changes in the Comoros and the Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The north borders the Sahel, the south and west border the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: We recommend that all female travelers answer that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring can help (but avoid anything that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to actions being considered harassment and that holding hands, for example, is not uncommon.
Don't be afraid to firmly reject men and stand up for yourself (whether it's a cultural difference or not, harassment is not to be ignored!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and then rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but they abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and the Spanish traders who established a trading post here called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting shopping destinations in Morocco.
In the old medina, you can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan products such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, water pipes and various other items, but they are all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried much of the town, including the city center.
Goma is relatively safe, but if you are visiting Goma from outside, you should do some research to understand the ongoing conflict in the North Kivu region.
The city is also the base for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trekking and Nyiragongo volcano climbing in Africa.
You can get around Goma by using Boda-Boda (motorcycle taxis). The normal (local) price is 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Combining the meaning of the relative approach with the impossibility of reaching it, 'Timbuktu' became a metaphor for an exotic and distant place.
Today Timbuktu is a poor town, but its fame has made it a tourist attraction, and it even has an airport.
Due to the effects of desert sand, in 1990, Timbuktu was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites.
It was one of the most significant expeditions in Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, "Africa's Great Civilizations."
The city is more Arab than African, which makes it stand out from the rest of Mali.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different zones, each supporting different wildlife.
This is one of South Africa's flagship destinations and is a flagship of SANParks.
Like all South African national parks, the park has a conservation fee and an entrance fee, both of which are payable daily.
It may be beneficial to purchase a wild card that allows entry to specific parks in South Africa or to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island is where the name Hong Kong was given to the territory and where many tourists focus their attention.
The line of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline is likened to a glittering bar graph because of the way it reflects on the surface of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views in Hong Kong, leave Hong Kong Island and head to the Kowloon waterfront, just across the harbour.
Most of Hong Kong's land reclamation is concentrated along the northern coast.
This is where the British colonial developers made their mark, so if you're looking for evidence of the former colonial territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast of Bangladesh to the Hugli River in India.
Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Within this forest, the Indian portion is called the Sundarbans National Park.
This forest is not just a mangrove swamp. It is home to some of the last vestiges of the great jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans is 3,850 km² in area, of which about a third is covered with water and marshland.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 deer in the area.
Buses run all day from the local intercity bus station (across the river), but buses specifically to the east and to Jachar/Bumthang only depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
The section buses are often full, so it is recommended to buy tickets in advance a few days before.
In most areas, comfortable and sturdy small-sized Isuzu coaster buses are used.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby areas, such as Faro (Nu 150) and Punaka (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that connects the Oyapock River with the Brazilian city of Oiapoque and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The height of the two main towers is 83 m, the length of the bridge is 378 m, and there are two lanes with a width of 3.50 m.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters, the construction was completed in August 2011, and the ban on traffic on the bridge will last until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when construction of the Brazilian customs checkpoint is completed.
The Guarani are the most important indigenous tribe, living in the east of present-day Paraguay, and were semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guarani and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, once called the "giant of the indies," was born in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the indigenous people.
The Spanish began a three-century colonial era.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has maintained a significant degree of indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having the best polo teams and players in the world.
The largest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Polo Towers in Las Vegas.
It is also possible to watch smaller tournaments and matches here during other periods of the year.
For tournament schedules and tickets to polo matches, check out the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is set at parity with the British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the island, located in Stanley, just across the street from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also widely accepted.
In the relevant booking area, UK and US currencies are accepted but credit cards are not. Please check with the owner in advance to determine what forms of payment are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so make sure you exchange your money before you leave.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, it is summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is a subtropical area, and in summer the temperature usually exceeds 30°C.
Winters can be incredibly cold, with temperatures dropping below freezing on rare occasions, but the wind and humidity can make it feel even colder than it actually is.
There is no "rainy season" or "dry season", rainfall is almost the same throughout the year.
Many of the park's animals are accustomed to humans, but they remain wild animals and should not be fed or harassed.
According to park officials, you must be at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and at least 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife.
No matter how easy they look to handle, bison, elk, moose, bears and almost all large animals are capable of attacking.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance. These animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so keep your distance.
Additionally, the smell can attract bears and other wildlife, so food should be kept and cooked away from the campsite and the campsite should be kept clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a famous naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser were sunk, and about 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
The Mau movement, which was organized to fight for independence, led to a peaceful gathering in the village that resulted in the death of the paramount chief, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland has a lot of beaches because it straddles two harbours. The most popular are in three areas.
North Shore beaches (North Shore City) face the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
It has almost all sandy beaches where safe swimming is possible, and most of the beaches have plenty of shady spots created by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located at Mission Bay and the suburb of St Heliers, on the outskirts of Auckland Central and the port of Waitamata.
These beaches are usually quiet family beaches, with a range of shops along the coastline. They are safe for swimming.
The main local beer is 'Number One', which is not complex in flavour but is a pleasant, refreshing beer. Another local beer is 'Manta'.
There are many French wines to try, but New Zealand and Australian wines are also readily available.
Tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you prefer.
The concept of a 'flat white' is foreign to Australians. Short blacks are 'espressos', cappuccinos come with a mountain of cream (not froth), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is Belgian standard, the fruit juice is expensive but very tasty.
I travel to this reef area year round, and injuries from these causes on the reef are rare.
Still, you should listen to the advice of officials, keep all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur from October to April, when they are sometimes found on beaches and estuaries.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the sea, but are found mainly in the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travellers the peace of mind that there will be somewhere to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Tour operators often have special deals on certain hotels, but it's also possible to book other types of accommodation through them, such as camping sites.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport pickup/transfers, and sometimes flights and hotels.
We also hold bookings for customers who need time to decide or need time to obtain other documentation for their destination (e.g. visas).
However, if you have any amendments or requests, please contact your travel agent first, rather than contacting the hotel directly.
At some festivals, many people attending the music festival decide to camp on site, and most attendees feel that camping is an experience that everyone should try at least once.
To get close to the fun and excitement, you need to get there early to secure a camping spot close to the music.
Although the songs played on the central stage may come to an end, don’t forget that music can be played until late at night in various parts of the festival.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the Baltic in winter, it's worth checking the location of your cabin, as the ship can make quite a racket as it passes over the ice.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms and conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money their guests spend. They often have no windows and no clocks, and it can be difficult to find the exits.
They always have special food, drinks and entertainment to keep visitors coming back and keep the good vibes going.
Some places even offer free alcohol, but since alcohol impairs judgment, good gamblers know the importance of not getting drunk.
If you plan to drive over high altitude or mountainous roads, you should consider the possibility of snow, ice or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy or snow-covered roads, the friction is reduced, so you can't drive properly as if you were on a bare asphalt.
If a blizzard hits, a lot of snow can fall in a short amount of time, and you can get stuck.
Visibility may also be restricted due to falling or blowing snow, raindrops, or frost on vehicle windows.
In contrast, there are many countries where icy or snowy roads are a daily occurrence, and where roads are not often blocked throughout the year.
Safari is probably the most spectacular tourist attraction in Africa and will be the highlight for many visitors.
The widely known expression safari refers especially to a land journey to see the wonderful African wildlife of the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles closely and can be well observed using standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and can be better observed with binoculars.
"A hiking safari (also known as a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "walking safari") consists of hiking that can be done for a few hours or several days."
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in various locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo, which hosted the Summer Olympics in 1964, will become the only city in Asia to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice.
If you booked your 2020 flights and accommodation before the announcement, things might get a little complicated.
Refund policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-related refund policies are not extended through the July 2020 Olympic Games.
Most event tickets range from 2,500 yen to 130,000 yen, with the average ticket price being around 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry faster. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for rent, even if they don't have one in the room.
If you don’t have an iron or don’t like to wear ironed socks, you can use a hair dryer.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (it may shrink or scorch).
There are other ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against certain hazards.
In some areas, boiling the water for one minute is sufficient. In others, the water may need to be boiled for several minutes.
Water filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned about the quality of your water, we recommend drinking bottled water from a reputable brand.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are not common in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause inflammation, or, in worse cases, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison, or carry infectious diseases.
Epidemic diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping provides an opportunity to purchase goods that are exempt from taxes and consumption taxes in certain regions.
Travelers to countries with heavy taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially when buying alcohol or tobacco.
The road between Point Marion and Fairmont, located in isolated mountainous terrain, is known as the most difficult stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful of steep inclines, narrow lanes and sharp bends.
The posted speed limit is significantly lower than the previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and adherence to the speed limit is much more important within that section than in other sections.
Interestingly, cell phone service is much stronger here than at many other points along this route, such as Pennsylvania Wye.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are similar to those of their southern neighbor Austria, with lots of butter and variety.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples being used all year round and cherries or plums being used more commonly in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes, in particular, pair well with strong brewed coffee.
If you want a small, flavorful bread, try this bread, which is called a Berliner, Panko, or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish that is based on medicinal plants and spices, and is accompanied by meat or vegetables.
"Depending on the amount of water, curry can be ""thick"" or ""thin""."
In northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries, while in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesian food is a broad term that encompasses the diverse regional cuisines of the entire archipelago of 17,000 islands.
However, when used without qualification, the term tends to refer to food from the central and eastern parts of the island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterised by a variety of simple, seasonal dishes, with peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and a variety of spices being the main flavours favoured by the Javanese.
The backrest is a support that holds the rider's feet on both sides of the saddle.
This device gives the rider much more stability, but it can be a safety issue because the foot can get caught.
If a person falls off a horse and their foot gets caught in the stirrup, the horse may run off and the person may be dragged along. There are several safety precautions you can take to minimize this risk.
First, most riders wear tall boots with a heel, a smooth sole and a narrow shaft.
Next, some saddles, especially in the UK, have a safety bar that can release the saddle from the saddle if the rider falls backwards.
Cochamó Valley - Known as the Yosemite Valley of South America, this is Chile's premier climbing destination, with a variety of big granite walls and rock towers.
The mountain tops offer breathtaking views that are worth the climb. Hikers from all over the world continue to seek new paths in nature, which is full of infinite potential.
Alpine snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving descending a snow-covered terrain while wearing skis or a snowboard.
"Ski trips are a way of travel for enthusiasts called 'ski bums,' who plan their vacations around the time they spend skiing in one particular place."
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings depicting people skiing date back to 5000 BC.
As a sport, downhill skiing dates back at least to the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was established by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Backcountry skiing: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
This activity is related to alpine ski touring and mountaineering, but usually does not include them, the latter of which is done on steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski course as a similar hiking course.
Under good conditions, you can go a little further than walking, but without well-groomed tracks and a heavy backpack, you will not get the speed that corresponds to cross-country skiing.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries, and traveling to several countries usually means going through visa applications and passport checks several times.
However, the Schengen zone acts somewhat like a single country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately for each Schengen member state, which saves you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of an antique, and in some states, an antique is defined as any item that is more than 100 years old.
North America has a shorter geographic definition of antiques than Europe.
Handmade items may be considered antiques even if they are not as old as mass-produced similar items.
Reindeer husbandry is one of the Sami people's most important livelihoods, and in trade, such a culture is also important for many other actors.
Traditionally, not all Sámi people were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but most lived off reindeer as draught animals, combined with fishing and hunting.
Today, many Sami people work in modern trade, and tourism is an important source of income in the Sami area of Sapmi.
In particular, the term "Gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is widely used by non-Roma, perpetuates negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma people.
If the country you are visiting becomes a travel warning area, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
While you might want to hear the government's opinion rather than your own, the advice of governments is tailored to their own people.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different circumstances than Europeans or Arabs.
The alert is just a brief summary of the political situation in one country.
The views presented are mainly superficial, general and over-simplified compared to the more detailed information that can be obtained elsewhere.
Severe weather is any dangerous meteorological phenomenon, with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Adverse weather can occur anywhere in the world and there are different types depending on the region, terrain and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, heavy rain, wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, snow squalls, graupel and dust storms.
Travelers should check the local weather beforehand to ensure their travel plans are not disrupted.
Anyone planning to visit a country considered a combat zone should seek professional training.
An internet search for "hostile environment course" will probably provide the address of a local company.
The lectures usually go into much more detail on all the issues discussed here, and are usually accompanied by practical experience.
The course usually lasts two to five days and involves role-playing, various first-aid scenarios and, sometimes, weapons training.
There are plenty of books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival, but few that deal with war zones.
Travellers planning gender reassignment surgery overseas should ensure they have valid documentation when returning to Australia.
Whether a passport is issued with an unspecified gender (X) or whether documents can be updated to reflect a preferred name and gender varies by government.
The willingness to accept these documents from foreign governments is also very varied.
In the post-September 11, 2001 era, security screening has become even more of a hassle.
Transgender people before surgery should not expect to pass through scanners because of their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are return currents from waves breaking on reefs or similar structures often found on beaches.
Due to the systematic classification within the water, the reductant is concentrated in some deep places, which can form from rapid current to deep water.
Most of them try to swim against the current, which is often impossible, and die from exhaustion.
Once out of the current, it's not too difficult to swim back to shore as usual.
You may want to try to get to a place where you won't be caught in the current again, or you may want to wait for rescue depending on your swimming ability and whether you've been spotted by someone else.
Re-entry shock happens faster than culture shock because there is no honeymoon period, it lasts longer, and it can be more intense.
Travelers who have had no difficulty adapting to new cultures often have a particularly hard time readjusting to their native culture.
When they return to their home country after living abroad, they may show a tendency to adapt to the culture of the foreign country while losing some of the habits of their own culture.
When you first went abroad, most people were patient and understanding because they knew that travelers had to adjust to a new country.
People may not think that patience and understanding are needed for travelers who are boarding their flights home.
The Pyramid Sound and Light Show is one of the most popular attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in the quiet before the show starts.
You always hear the sounds of tourists and vendors. The story of light and sound is like a storybook.
Sphinx is set up as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
Scenes were projected onto the pyramids and other pyramids were lit up.
Discovered in 1819, the South Shetland Islands are claimed by several countries and in 2020, 16 countries were active, with the most bases.
The system is about 120km north of the Antarctic Peninsula, with the largest being King George Island, where Villa Las Estrellas is located.
Others include Livingston and Desolation islands, which are home to active volcanoes and natural harbors filled with water-filled caldera lakes.
Elsweyr is located in the south of the peninsula and borders the Sea of Beltinghause.
Here the peninsula's mountains rise to plateaus, then re-emerge to form a 360-kilometre-long belt of the Elsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or the Sentinel Range has Vinson Massif, the highest mountain in Antarctica, which is 4,892 m high.
In remote areas where cell phone coverage is not available, satellite phones may be the only option.

The service is frequently used in maritime transportation, including Yulong vessels, and where Wuneng data and voice services are needed.
For access to this service, you may want to contact your local telecommunications service provider for more information.
More and more people are using gap years for travel and study.
This is particularly popular with graduates, who can take a year out of their studies without the burden of academic work.
In most cases, enrolling on an overseas gap-year course can actually increase your chances of going on to higher education in your home country.
Usually, there is a fee to enroll in these training programs.
"Finland is a great destination for boating. The "Land of a thousand lakes" has thousands of islands in addition to its lakes and archipelago coastline."
You don't need a yacht to enjoy the archipelago and the lakes.
Although the coastal archipelago and large lakes are big enough for any yacht, sailing a smaller boat or even a kayak is a different experience.
In Finland, boating is a national leisure activity, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is similar in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is quite unusual outside of these countries (in New Zealand it is one in 40).
Most Baltic cruises certainly offer an extended stay in Russia's St. Petersburg.
This means you can spend two days visiting the historic city all day and return to your cruise ship at night to sleep.
If you go to the coast on a boat trip, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises include a guidebook that features Berlin, Germany, but as you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and visiting the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be a scary experience for anyone, but especially if you’ve never flown before or if you have a fear of flying.
This is nothing to be ashamed of, no different from the personal fears, loathings and other things that most people have.
For some people, understanding how an aircraft works and what happens during a flight, or overcoming fears based on not knowing or not being in control, can help.
Courier companies are paid a lot of money to deliver goods quickly, and often time is of the essence, especially when it comes to business documents, emergency repairs, or spare parts.
Major airlines use their own planes on some routes, but if it's a different route or a smaller airline, there's a problem.
If you sent it as air cargo, it may take several days to unload and clear customs on some routes.
The only way to get it processed faster was to send it as checked baggage, which airline rules require to be sent without a passenger on board.
The sure-fire way to fly first or business class is to pay a thick wad of cash to enjoy the privilege (or, better, have your company pay for you).
So it’s not cheap, expect to pay around four times the price of business class or up to 11 times the price of first class!
Generally, direct flights from A to B are so cheap that it doesn't even make sense to look for a seat discount, whether it's business or first class.
Airlines know there are certain key passenger segments that are willing to pay big money for fares that are priced to privilege speed and comfort over everything else.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
The 1994 conflict resulted in the creation of the Transnistria Republic, a self-proclaimed state in eastern Moldova with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member state.
Although political negotiations between the two Moldovas failed, economic relations were restored.
The main religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodoxy.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, and has the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transportation hub.
Once an ancient city, Sumyra is now a modern, developed and bustling commercial center, surrounded by mountains and a huge bay.

Bus 403 by Scotturb runs regularly to Sintra, stopping in Cabo da Roca.
Also, to the north, visit the world-famous Sanctuary of Fátima, a site of Marian apparitions.
Remember that this is basically a huge cemetery and a place of almost incalculable significance to a major part of the world's population.
There are still many people alive who survived here, and many more who were killed here or died from the labor, Jewish and non-Jewish alike.
Treat this place with dignity, solemnity, and respect. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not scratch or deface the structure or leave the site dirty.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to use Catalan, the majority understands it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, the official language established by law.

The regular announcements on the metro are only in Catalan, but in the event of an unplanned service interruption, an automatic system broadcasts in various languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.

The brusque exterior of Parisians will quickly disappear if you show them basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is mostly covered in dense forests of beech, fir, spruce, and Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The wide range of microclimates, different soils and varying altitudes result in a wide range of plant communities.

Here, rare species such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and the great bustard are found alongside many more common species.
While visiting the monastery, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and shoulders.
Most monasteries provide covers for women visitors who have not brought their own, but if you bring your own, especially in bright colors, you will be welcomed with a smile by the monk or nun at the entrance.
Along the same lines, men are asked to wear pants that cover their knees.
You can rent them at the entrance, but since not everyone washes them after use, it can be uncomfortable to wear these skirts. They are one size and can be worn by all men!
Like the food of the Mediterranean-like regions, Majorcan food uses bread, vegetables, meat (especially pork), and olive oil as its main ingredients.
A simple and popular summer evening meal is a pâté en croûte, which is bread filled with readily available ingredients such as cheese or tuna, tomato and olive oil.
All nouns used with the word Sie, meaning you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and nouns.
It's a bit complicated because you have to figure out whether the verb or adjective is used in a noun phrase, but it does make reading easier.
Italian is relatively easy to pronounce because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.

Pre-modern observatories are now mostly obsolete and are used as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution was not at the level it is today, these were located in places that were easily accessible, such as cities or campuses, unlike today's observatories.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The cherry blossom viewing event known as hanami has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.

Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have become universal, even among non-Christians in Christian-majority countries and non-Christians around the world.
It is a tradition to spend Easter night awake in a place where you can see the sunrise.
Of course there is a Christian theological explanation for this tradition, but it may be a pre-Christian spring and harvest ritual.
More traditional churches hold a Vigil of the Resurrection on the Saturday night of Holy Week, where the faithful often celebrate the Resurrection of the Lord at midnight.
All the animals that first arrived on the island either swam, flew or floated to the island.
Mammals could not travel as far from the mainland as the giant tortoises, which were the primary herbivores on the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs, have been brought to the islands.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you'll experience polar nights when the sun doesn't rise above the horizon.
The dark skies offer a good chance to see the Northern Lights.

Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Western cultures.
Suits are the standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by title and surname.
Teamwork is very important in the workplace, so the joint effort is emphasized more than individual performance.
Workers must obtain approval from their supervisors for any decision they make and must follow their supervisors' instructions without question.
