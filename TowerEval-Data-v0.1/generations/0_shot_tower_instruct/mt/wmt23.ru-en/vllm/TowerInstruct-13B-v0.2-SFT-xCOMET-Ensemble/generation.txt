The July issue is traditionally submitted during the Moscow Film Festival, and this is, of course, very sad: to read the columns when the soul yearns for Chabrol.
However, we will talk about the MMCFF next time (for now, I will just complain that this year, the organizers finally became convinced of the inexplicable idea that happy owners of purchased tickets are several times more important for the festival than accredited guests, a ridiculous and quite offensive principle that no normal film festival in the world is guilty of), and in this issue, we report on what we saw in Cannes and at Kinotavr.
The cover of the July issue is adorned with another pleasant face - the main character of the film "Predators" produced by Robert Rodriguez, and inside the magazine, try not to miss the story about "The Beginning" by Christopher Nolan (the man, by the way, who rebooted "Batman..."), the most - without a doubt - anticipated film of the summer.
This time we are also publishing the first part of a fairly detailed guide to the work of Alfred Hitchcock, and here it is definitely not necessary to advertise anything in particular, and it is clear to me that the author of "Suspicion" and "The Rope" is our Tatiana Alekseeva, Boris Glazerev, Anna Golovnya, Nick De Semlin, Dan Joling, Tamara Dondurey, Nikolai Karaev, Denis Korsakov, Maria Kuvshinova, Ivan Kulikov, Will Lawrence, Sergei Mezenov, Sergei Natapov, Ian Nathan, Kim Newman, Zaira Ozova, Neve Pearce, Alexey Prostiakov, Seraphima Skibyuk, Adam Smith, Mour Soboleva, Vasily Stepanov, Alexander Strelkov, Ollie Richards, Oleg Tishchenkov, Alena Logunova, Chris Hughitt, Olga Shakina, London-based journalist Evelyn Salt, despite her brilliant track record, was suspected of spying in favor of the Russians and decided to catch her at any cost.
Cornered, it will turn black, as we know it, and go out to find the truth.
The next action movie with Angelina Jolie in the role of a fatal girl promises to further strengthen the actress's position in the action genre.
She will cause one car accident after another, run along walls like in The Matrix, and throw strong men around like children in the same strict suits.
That's how beauty should save the world.
Here he is, the native, who blew up and fixed the world with "The Fifth Element" and made Milla Jovovich the most beautiful woman in the universe.
Bruce Willis was the most superheroic guy, and Gary Oldman was the most stylish and flawless embodiment of Evil.
And yet, all together, it turned out not to be a tedious American-style blockbuster about saving humanity, but a charming living carnival.
I don't want to remember what Besson did for 13 years between "The Element..." and "Adèle...".
He, to put it mildly, did not sit idle, but all this scriptwriting and production fuss and rare, hard-won directorial performances will be forgotten.
But "Adele..." - hardly.
When you watch this movie, it seems that the 13 years before us was not our Besson, but some kind of double.
He himself, the real one, lived in a small apartment in Montmartre, drank wine in a cafe across the street and wrote a story about a charming adventurer.
To recount the plot (even in broad strokes), heightening expectations, is more sinful than usual in this case.
The incredible thrill here is that around every corner or line of dialogue, there are surprises waiting for you.
And they are all pleasant.
Either a girl, or a vision
The unusual adventures of Adel
The wildest adventure movie of the decade suggests that "The Extraordinary Adventures of Adele" will start like "Amelie", veer towards "Jurassic Park", continue with "Indiana Jones" and "The Mummy", and end with "Titanic".
The film is based on the first volume of Jacques Tardi's comics about journalist Adele Blanc-Sec.
Louise Bourguen to Adeli has only appeared in three films.
The actress became famous for her role in "The Girl from Monaco", for which she was nominated for a Cesar Award.
The director does not run after the viewer with outstretched arms, begging them to appreciate the special effects, sets, or stunts, but instead draws them in, like an old-fashioned novelist, exclaiming before a great journey to the center of the earth or to the ends of the world: "Forward, my reader, great deeds await us!"
In doing so, Besson approaches genre cinema, which everyone knows about, unceremoniously and cheerfully, like a boy who has watched old films and read Jules Verne.
Manipulating banality, not denying oneself cynicism and not being afraid of risk
Director Luc Besson
IN ROLES: Louis Bourgogne, Mathieu Amalric, Frederic Bel, Gilles Lelouch
STORY: Strange things were happening in Paris in 1912.
The city was terrified by an ancient monster, which was brought to life by an old medium.
The police are chasing the fossil creature, as well as a famous hunter, a couple of scientists from the Museum of Natural History, and journalist Adele Blanc-Sec, who has a case not so much with the creature itself, but with a medium - she needs to save her sister.
For the same purpose, the girl is dragging a real mummy from Egypt.
Coming out on July 22
"Adele..." is a case where parody becomes the pinnacle of the genre itself and is capable of radically changing it, directing it along a new path.
This was the case with Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, Quentin Tarantino's gangster films, the aforementioned Indiana Jones (they both paid tribute to and mocked it), and finally, the same Fifth Element.
Besson's style in this film is made up of verbal trickery, actor clowning, and plot acrobatics (circus terms are entirely appropriate - the union of the two arts here is organic and strong as ever).
A few words should be said about Adele herself.
It embodied the undeservedly forgotten type of adventuress, who takes not so much by exploiting sexuality, but by pure courage and bravery.
In movies, such girls are usually paired with some kind of macho or romantic guy
TEXT: ALEXANDER STRELKOV
Face to face with history
There is only a timid and comical admirer, who only twists under his feet (his knowledge of zoology only proves useful).
Therefore, the energetic girl does not waste time on love nonsense, but cheerfully spends time in the company of ancient corpses, which, by the way, play a key role in the plot.
Trained on numerous genre "cats" and seemingly completely spoiled, Luc Besson showed unexpected creative fervor, reminding that the border between the preferences of bored visitors to mega-malls and high-brow regulars of art-house halls is easily overcome by films for cheerful lunatics.
Playing adventure movies without sadness, fear, or blame
The Death Room
The hermetic horror with claims to psychologism and political context, the debut horror film by Jonathan Liebesman in 2002 was torn apart by critics, but it was liked by the public and earned well at the box office, and most importantly, it caught the eye of producer Michael Bay.
This is how the young director ended up at a factory that churns out new horrors according to old recipes: Bay set himself the goal of re-shooting the entire horror classic in the form of remakes and entrusted Libesman with a prequel to "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (2006).
The critics again scoffed, but the public liked it again - Libesman worked in the spirit of the "new horrors", which emphasize the excessive physiological nature of violence.
In general, his example shows how an entire genre is struggling in convulsions, trying to invent new ways to influence a saturated audience: the naturalistic bloodshed of splatterers merges with the chase scenes of slashers.
The plot is reminiscent of the Saw franchise, but without the gallons of blood.
Among the prototypes is the debut film by Vincenzo Natali, "Cube". The film was made by Michael Bay.
So in the "Death Room", Libesman had to take a different path: instead of the mindless slaughter or monotonous running from a maniac, he chose a smarter option - almost without the notorious bloodshed, but with psychological games and riddles.
The evil doctors here are playing cat and mouse with the test subjects.
Three men are locked in a room and must come up with a survival strategy: team up or shoot each other?
Play by the rules and obey orders from outside?
Or try to break out of your cell at any cost?
They are not the only ones being tested, but also a young ambitious employee of the special services, who is being tested for ruthlessness by an experienced professor who is well-versed in wild experiments.
STORY: For $250, four volunteers sign up for an easy test.
They are put in an isolated room and given a stack of sheets with meaningless questions.
Then a polite person in a white coat enters the room, introduces himself as a doctor and shoots one of the test subjects in the head.
A game of survival begins, which government agents closely observe through the glass.
Too contemplative for a horror film, but not enough for explicit arthouse
He can hold a conversation with the world, and go to the face with a fire extinguisher, but he cannot let a single skirt pass.
On the contrary, the charming Nastya is cautious and unyielding in her sympathies.
She is offended by her father's courteous lifestyle and openly watches as he, as if parodying the famous scene from Paul Verhoeven's Showgirls, dives into the pool in search of another romantic victim.
The daughter rebels, and the father tempts her young suitor from a poor family with money.
But the main topic of the family conflict is not the difference in generations or the choice of profession, which is already predetermined one way or another, but the girl's unsuccessful attempts to refute the obvious idea that everything is bought and sold in modern Moscow.
The sluggish melodramatic Mger Mkrtchan, along with Pavel Bardin, filmed a comedy with Ivan Urgant called "Three and a Snowflake".
Depardieu convincingly portrayed the father of a growing daughter in the comedy genre
The fragmented plot revolves around the love affairs of the characters, who are always discussing psychology, but themselves, apparently, due to a clever directorial idea, focus on the language of the gaze and gesture.
Secondary plot lines (a girl who was injured in a car accident, whom Aleksey wants to marry, and an alcoholic athlete played by Sergei Gorobchenko) are, unfortunately, only sketched out.
The line about the business of buying up football players, which was left out of the film, is particularly unfortunate.
STORY: The agent who sells football stars is most concerned about the fate of his underage daughter Nastya.
The kind-hearted dad changes his women like expensive shirts, but his daughter is about to turn eighteen, and she must definitely marry a guy with a "spine".
How disappointing it is for the businessman when Nastya, in the struggle for independence and in defiance of her father, chooses his peer and business partner.
However, the author hit the nail on the head with a potential slogan for the film's audience: "Don't look for a problem where there isn't one." You couldn't put it more accurately.
Their similarity is simply amazing.
In both films, there are teams of tough guys, soldiers of fortune, who are forced to take revenge on those who betrayed them, and in each company there is one beautiful girl.
The heroes jump almost to the same parts of the world (both films start in Latin America and end in the port of Los Angeles) and exploit the same spectacular shots - something stuffed with dollar bills explodes there and a whirlwind of dollars descends on the set.
Even the villains, dressed in expensive costumes, are not easy to distinguish from each other (they are played by both Patricks - Jason Patrick here, Patrick Wilson there).
Zoë Saldana's previous role was Neytiri in Avatar.
Silvën White used to make dance battle movies - "Brotherhood of Dance".
Chris Evans was recently called to play the hero of other comics: he will be Captain America.
Director Sylvain White was inspired by a series of comics that came out in the 70s and was relaunched in the 2000s, Joe Carnahan - a comedy series from the 80s.
It's just amazing how they, without colluding, led different material to an absolutely identical thunderous marker, making quite heavy, predictable, unnecessary action movies, which evoke a lot of images of Willis and Schwarzenegger in memory (comparisons invariably turn out in favor of Bruce and Arnold).
If you have to choose between these two films, then "Losers" looks a little more attractive and is clearly more successful in terms of efficiency (after all, the budget is three and a half times smaller).
At least there's Zoey Saldana, who looks great in a bazooka
IN ROLES: Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Zoey Saldana, Chris Evans, Patrick Wilson, Idris Elba, Columbus Short
STORY: During an operation in the Bolivian jungle, a group of seasoned commandos working for the CIA were set up by their own superiors: the helicopter with the children they were trying to save was blown up, and the soldiers themselves have been considered dead since that second.
But they are alive - and they intend to take revenge on the scoundrel with the sinister voice who arranged all this.
All of this is nice, but, to be honest, spending an hour and a half of your life on a White picture is only worth it if you have absolutely no other options.
Made from recycled materials, a conditionally edible bug
A simple story about a fugitive Romanian convict
A Romanian low-budget film that won a prize at a prestigious international film festival.
In principle, having only these data at hand, one can vividly imagine the hypothetical content of the painting, and even some specific details of the form.
Without a shadow of a doubt, the film promises to be socially relevant.
Of course, it will be realistic, and at the same time, tough.
There is a high probability of the participation of non-professional actors.
The film will also feature a lot of Romanian poverty (yes, poverty knows no nationality, but Romanian poverty, as our festival winners prove from film to film, is especially poor).
Also, without knowing the year of release, one can easily mistake what is happening on the screen for the exercises of some underground critical realists from the Warsaw Pact countries, who were lectured about Bresson in the early 80s
The film received the Grand Prix of the Jury at the Berlin IFF.
The screenplay is based on a play by Andrea Valian, whose work is in particular demand among the directors of the Romanian "new wave".
Operator Marius Panduru often works with Corneliu Porumboiu.
Everything said is true for the debut work of Florin Serban, and - understand us correctly - is not at all derogatory, but rather recommendatory: the Romanian "new wave" is in that blissful stage of development when its representatives believe in the methods
His work has not yet been shaken.
This is the moment to catch: it is only thanks to this faith that one can endure the one and a half hour spectacle of the Romanian colony for minors and surrender to the charisma of the talented Pistereanu (whose story, despite the abyss separating two cultures, can be easily shared).
convert it into an 70s-style exploitation movie, with a cowboy who decides to take a walk from prison, where he will soon be released, to the nearest saloon).
IN ROLES: Georg Pistereanu, Ada Condescu, Mihai Constantin, Clara Voda, Marian Bratu
SYNOPSIS: After serving his four years, 18-year-old inmate Silviu (Pistereanu) is about to be released, but suddenly finds out that his mother wants to take his younger brother with her to Italy.
From this point on, the young man's behavior becomes inadequate.
An affair with social worker Anna further pushes the guy to desperate acts, the meaning of which is exhausted by the name of the picture.
What a load of rubbish!
If you want to watch - watch.
A decent debut, which gives a faint hope that a decent direction will emerge from the Romanian art house one day
A cartoon about the joys of villainy and family life
The directorial debut of a man named Grob (Soop) and his co-author Reno was made under the auspices of producer Christopher Meledandri, the gray cardinal of American animation, responsible, in particular, for all "Ice Ages", "Horton" and "Robots".
"Ugly Me" is probably the best work of his team: the picture is beautifully drawn (by the way, it makes sense to watch it in 3D), especially if you like it when different objects keep trying to jump out of the screen into the hall), it is written decently, and, most importantly, there is not a single low-brow joke, because of which one had to shamefully squeeze into the chair and cover one's ears with one's hands during "Ice Ages".
It is clear that the reason for the change in course was not the authors' sense of measure, but the blatant asexuality of the main character, which in turn was dictated by a reluctance to touch on the topic of pedophilia in any way.
For the "adult" part, in addition to the main conflict of single fatherhood, there is quite a harsh black humor (which, one would think, we owe to the director Coffin).
Overall, it's a very nice film - so much so that at some point it even seems too perfect and correct.
The hard work of a well-coordinated team of marketers is evident, who have thought through every detail to ensure that the film will appeal to all categories of citizens.
Not that we want to see the heroes of a children's cartoon eaten by cannibals or destroyed by a nuclear explosion
STORY: The snouted villain Gru, whose childhood dreams of space travel have transformed over the years into the idea of stealing the moon, is forced to enlist the help of children to carry out his grand plan and eliminate his young competitor.
In a certain advanced shelter, he adopts three orphan girls - Margo in glasses, Edith in a hat, and Agnes, who is as adorable as the cat from Shrek.
As it usually happens, children immediately transform the plans of adults.
The main character is based on Christopher Melendandri - both of them are bald, have big noses and tend to black humor.
In the original, the main characters were voiced by Steve Carell and Jason Segel.
In the finale, Gru dances Travolta's part
A car pulls up to an abandoned trailer somewhere in the middle of a desert, and three pairs of well-dressed women get out.
That's right.
The bearers of this gift are not so significant in themselves.
The camera confidently focuses attention on this part of the body.
For fans, we have good news right away - the entire film is in the same spirit.
Rick Jacobson understands the right things about female beauty and has cast the film in such a way that what is happening on the screen is secondary.
And a lot of funny things happen.
The "broker", "killer" and "stripper" dig in the sand, get drenched in water (don't ask why), carry some kind of foul-smelling substance and periodically engage in fierce fighting.
The creators believe that a mothering cow with generous forms, smeared in mud, with a broken nose and shining white teeth is cool.
"Stervoznye shutki" is primarily focused on classic sexploitation films.
Rick Jacobson directed episodes of Xena: Warrior Princess and Hercules: The Legendary Journeys.
A film with a similar spirit is currently in the Moscow box office: "A Gun for Jennifer".
It's even cooler when a bitchy beauty is screwing a bandit, a punk with a hole in his head is fighting with a Japanese schoolgirl, a samurai sword and lesbian sex are involved; and the intrigue is built up through an endless number of flashbacks.
In general, for a film fetishist, this is a real Klondike of pleasures.
Of course, it's clear that Jacobson and his gang had a lot of fun making this trashy parody, but the task itself seems rather strange.
If it weren't for the physical data of the actresses, it would have already become boring by the middle.
It can be assumed that this fowl came to us from the nighttime adult channel (Jacobson, by the way, often takes on serial episodes)
IN ROLES: Julia Voth, Erin Cummings, America Olivo, Michael Hirst, Ron Melendez
PLOT: Three dangerous beauties bring the mafia boss to the desert, where diamonds worth a substantial amount are hidden somewhere.
Having achieved nothing and having shot the unfortunate bandit, the girls start to scratch each other, fight with each other and the occasional thugs who arrive from somewhere, as well as regularly kissing and cuddling.
As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that all three are not who they appeared to be at the beginning.
Apparently, according to the author, it's even more fun that way.
A product for a narrow circle of lovers of monstrous nonsense
Yes, with his last film, "Judgment Day", a watered-down "Mad Max" for the poor, Marshall has made a serious misstep
The bloodthirsty and biting peplum returns the director's shaken confidence.
The new politically incorrect and gloomy magnum opus does not shy away from a modest budget, obvious sources of inspiration, and the ferocious film aesthetics of category "B".
The film also has a hooligan spirit in "Dogs of War" and animal cruelty in "The Descent".
The Marshall Plan to clean up the "peplum" from the post-gladiator movie dirt, in general, worked.
In 2011, Kevin Macdonald will present his interpretation of the story of the Ninth Legion.
His battle-scarred legionnaires (among others, the unexpectedly colorful David Morrissey and Liam Cunningham) are tough guys trying to reconcile their military duty with an overwhelming desire to survive.
Murder and the salacious details of going to the bathroom in ancient times are depicted here with love and detail.
The scene of the destruction of the Ninth Legion, which cost a lot of budget money, is directly inspired by the opening scene in the German forests from the now classic Gladiator by Sir Ridley Scott, but for some reason, I don't want to accuse Marshall of plagiarism: he works honestly and without complaints.
IN ROLES: Michael Fassbender, Olga Kurylenko, Dominic West, Liam Cunningham, David Morrissey
STORY: The lands of modern Scotland, occupied by the Holy Roman Empire.
A remote outpost, where centurion Quintus Diaz (Fassbender) is serving, is mercilessly defeated by the Pictish reconnaissance unit.
The miraculously saved Diaz is forced to first join the infamous Ninth Legion, and then, with a group of other surviving Romans, try to escape from a group of Pictish fighters led by the sadist Itain (Kurilenko).
The subtle art house actor has so far managed to win only sharply characterized supporting roles in Hollywood, but one very much wants to believe that after Centurion, the situation will change.
Pepulum is a corrected and supplemented edition.
Almost like Gladiator, only more modest and severe
The continuation of the story about the schoolgirl Bella (Kristen Stewart) and her complicated relationship with two extremely promising young people - the pale-faced vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and the werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner).
Pattinson's fans held their breath.
A large-scale cinematic version of the animated series about a bald boy-wizard, who is called upon to bring peace to four kingdoms.
The Lord of Fire has started a bloody war and subjugated his neighbors.
Young Aang can stop him only if he learns to control all the elements and becomes the Avatar.
Cobb's (Leonardo DiCaprio) house is able to steal other people's thoughts and works tirelessly in the field of industrial espionage.
By penetrating the object's sleep, it forces the sleeping brain to work according to its own rules.
But this time he has to do the opposite - leave in one head what was not there.
A masterclass in managing illusory worlds from Christopher Nolan.
An experienced wizard (Nicolas Cage) finds himself a young assistant in the hope of defeating an evil magician (Alfred Molina) together.
With the help of destructive spells, they will create a disaster in the middle of Manhattan with dragons and explosions.
As bald as a billiard ball, the cat has devised a plan to take over the world, and now the super-agents dogs are forced to join forces with their meowing antagonists.
The second series of the fluffy family comedy.
A group of ruthless thugs led by the seemingly weak-looking Royce (Adrien Brody) mysteriously find themselves on another planet, where they are hunted by stylish, fanged aliens.
The return of a cult character from the 80s to the big screen.
Pay attention to George Clooney, who teamed up with rock photographer-turned-director Anton Corbijn (Control) for a very interesting existential study of the psychology of an aging hitman hiding from people in a small Italian town and belatedly coming to terms with human nature.
"A visionary artist on the scale of Corbijn and the magnificent George Clooney - this is a cinematic union made in heaven," boasts the studio press release.
In addition, this project is another confirmation of the longest love affair in Clooney's life - with Italy: the filming took place in the picturesque town of Castel del Monte in Abruzzo.
Taking Martin Buta's novel "The Very Secret Gentleman" as a basis, Rowan Joffe made some changes to his screenplay: the place of the English narrator was taken by an American, and the main character, a gunsmith-outlaw, turned into a simple murderer.
The rest of the story is close to the original: while the killer Jack tries to deal with his last job and finally quit his lucrative trade, his icy heart melts under the charm of the local priest (Paolo Bonacelli) and a street prostitute (Tekla Ruten), whom Clooney's character instantly falls in love with.
"Jack tempts fate," says the official synopsis.
A dangerous messenger of darkness is getting closer and closer to him, and the mysterious lady who hires him may not be who she claims to be."
Judging by the trailer, Corbijn's visual experiments, seasoned with Clooney's ashy hair (the film resembles a long clip 02), have reached a qualitatively new level.
Daniel Radcliffe will play the lead role in the screen adaptation of Remarque's "All Quiet on the Western Front"
Or can I click you with a shotgun!?
Johnny Depp could be seen in two places at once this season.
First, in Venice on the set of the thriller "The Tourist" by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck ("The Lives of Others").
There he plays a heroin-addicted tourist in love with Angelina Jolie.
Secondly, in Puerto Rico, on the set of The Rum Diary, an adaptation of the debut novel by the legendary Hunter S. Thompson.
The director and screenwriter of the project is Bruce Robinson (“Withnail and I”), whose last directorial work was the thriller “Jennifer 8” in 1992.
Looking at the work of the poster artists of the domestic prison drama, one can even not doubt what inspired them.
But we can't approach the issue of implementing the idea literally!
However, at least it's good that the heroine of the Russian film is not a stranger, but not bald at all.
Director Dennis Dugan mainly specializes in projects with Adam Sandler.
They have already completed four joint projects: "Gilmore's Lucky Man", "Big Daddy", "Chuck and Larry: Fire Wedding", "Don't Mess with Gohan!".
In July, the fifth comedy, "Classmates", is released, and the sixth, "The Wife-Imposter", starring Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman, is in production.
The seventh film is also included in the schedule - a romantic comedy "Jack and Jill", where Sandler will have to play both Jack and his twin sister Jill at the same time.
Matthew Vaughn, who was remembered by the audience this year with the fantastic action movie "Pipet", will be in charge of the X-Men reboot.
In the film "X-Men: First Class", the director first called James McAvoy, giving him the role of a young X-Men professor.
Rosamund Pike will play the mutant telepath Emma Frost, aka the White Queen, Amber Heard will transform into the blue-skinned Mystique, and Michael Fassbender will presumably become Magneto.
While filming of the new Bond series is postponed, its new director Sam Mendes is not bored.
On his list of tasks is the musical "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" and the screen adaptation of the novel by Izen McEuzan "On the Shore".
The script will be adapted by the author himself.
Carey Mulligan has been offered the lead female role.
Gary Oldman is considering the role of the practical Major George Smiley - the main character of a series of novels by John Le Carre - in the screen adaptation of the thriller "The Spy Who Came Out of the Cold".
In the first adaptation of this work in 1979, Alec Guinness played the role.
The new version will be directed by Danish director Thomas Alfredson, creator of the horror film "Let Me In".
Tom Tykwer will adapt the fantastic bestseller novel by David Mitchell, Cloud Atlas.
According to the director, it is not an easy (the novel has six parallel storylines), but extremely interesting work.
Offers have already been received from Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, James McAvoy, Ian McKellen and Natalie Portman.
The international action film by Maxim Korostyshevsky, tentatively titled Soldiers of Fortune, is being filmed in Crimea.
It is dedicated to millionaires who have gone to war in search of adrenaline.
The film stars Christian Slater, Sean Bean, Wing Rams, Dominic Monaghan, Oksana Korostyshevskaya and others.
The film is scheduled to premiere in early 2011.
Sam Rockwell will star in the comedy "Baby Jesus" alongside English pop star Pixie Lott
Megan Fox was fired from Transformers 3
According to the Ragotype film company, the dismissal "is not related to the interview in which Fox compared Michael Bay to Hitler."
However, the place of the main heroine and the new love interest of Shia LaBeouf is likely to be taken by the English model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.
The girl has no experience in film, so she will have to take accelerated acting courses.
This fact should not frighten the discerning viewer - there are many examples in the history of cinema of successful retraining of models into actresses.
Charlize Theron ("Monster"), Angelina Jolie ("Life Interrupted"), Jessica Lange ("Blue Sky", "Tutsi"), Kim Basinger ("Secrets of Los Angeles"), Jennifer Connelly ("Mind Games"), Gina Davis ("The Accidental Tourist") and "First Vice-Miss USA-86" Halle Berry ("Ball of Monsters") started as models or appeared in fashion magazines, and eventually received a well-deserved "Oscar".
They have succeeded in acting (also the beautiful Milla Jovovich, Cameron Diaz, Monica Bellucci and, especially pleasing, our compatriot Olga Kurylenko.
High awards are clearly within their reach.
In short, Rosie has someone to look up to.
Valeria Gaia Germani, who received a Special Mention from the Cannes jury in 2008 for the film "Everyone Will Die, But I Will Remain" and who directed the scandalous TV series "School", has been appointed creative director at MT TV.
The channel's management believes that it is Valeria who will be able to bring about the desired and necessary changes.
In particular, plans are already underway to film their own series (about teenagers or about vampires).
Also, Germanika began casting new hosts.
The comedy "Kolotilov" by director Leo Gabriadze and producer Timur Bekmambetov unexpectedly turned into "Vykrutasy".
The main theme of the film remained the same - the provincial Russian language teacher Slava Kolotilov (Konstantin Khabensky) rushes to Moscow to his fiancée, but is delayed to train a football team of orphans.
The second plot line of the film has undergone a new development.
Instead of actress Elena Plaksina, the role of the capital's bride Nadya will be played by Milla Jovovich.
As an additional intrigue, a third one will appear - Nadia's former fiancé Danya (Ivan Urgant).
So, in addition to the question of whether the street team will win the football championship, there is a dilemma about who will get Milla Jovovich.
Due to the constant delays in filming The Hobbit and the presence of a multitude of external projects, Guillermo del Toro has abandoned his position as director.
Studios are urging producer Peter Jackson to take the project completely into his own hands, but he is only willing to do so if it is absolutely necessary.
Possible successors include David Yates, who finished filming the Harry Potter saga, and Neil Blomkamp, whose film "District 9", produced by Jackson, received an Oscar nomination.
The new director's name will be officially announced at the next Soths-Sop convention at the end of July.
Angelina Jolie will play Cleopatra
Overwhelmed by the tight schedule, critics and filmmakers rushed between the Sochi Winter Theater, where screenings with master classes were held, and the Zhemchuzhina Hotel, where press conferences and round tables were held in a continuous stream, barely managing to dive into the Black Sea.
The heroes of the competition films also behaved in a similar manner - almost everyone was running somewhere: the confused Asians from Yusup Razykov's "Gastarbeiter" and Dmitry Mamulia's "Another Sky" were looking for a missing grandson and wife, and the escaped gangster from Yuri Bykov's "Living"
The same mentors were happily led around by the finger by the hero of the detective Klim Shipenko's "Who am I?" - which, however, was remembered by the public more for the presence in the frame of the totally naked Zhanna Friske.
Local show business heroes appeared in a couple of competitive films - in the film "Slon" Sergey Shnurov played a truck driver who was taking a circus animal to slaughter, and Evgeny Grishkovets mused on his favorite topics - female betrayal, male loneliness, the healing power of alcohol - in the film adaptation for two "Satisfaction", where business partners challenged each other to an alcohol duel over a woman.
However, even the business events at Kinotavr had a noticeable showbiz flavor - not a single one was boring.
At a round table dedicated to the fate of Russian art house cinema, the chairman of the fund for the support of domestic cinema, Sergei Tolstikov, arranged a lively quarrel with critics: "Do you even read the articles in the press that I read?" he angrily asked those gathered.
"I write them," replied the president of ERVEZS! Andrei Plahov, confusedly.
The scandals did not end there: closer to the end of the festival, the film Ovsiyanki by Aleksey Fedorchenko was suddenly removed from the competition program - it will go to Venice: the selectors of Mostra decided that an extra Russian screening was a hindrance to them.
Previously, KinoTavr did not interfere with the giants - films from major festivals were shown in Sochi more than once: this time, for example, Sergei Loznitsa's film "My Happiness" participated in the competition, having competed with Mikhalkov and Virasethakun on the Cote d'Azur in the spring.
Nikita Sergeevich visited the film of a former Cannes competitor at the Kinotavr festival and said that he liked it.
The chairman of the jury, Karen Shakhnazarov, on the contrary, did not like the film at all - but under pressure from colleagues, he was forced to give it the prize for directing.
The award for best debut - "Missing" - was received by the daughter
A terrifying film encyclopedia of Russian life: the naive, humane, and rational hero is beaten, robbed, and provoked into monstrous acts without any apparent purpose.
A precisely crafted, purifying film experience, shot by a misanthropic mathematician, which calls for only one thing - start thinking.
A debutant with a philosophical education, Mamulia calls his films quotes from Mamaradashvili, avoids any events in the script, and claims that the viewer's joy is in the work of understanding his inaccessible meditative films.
The most difficult picture of Kinotavr has already been selected for the competition in Karlovy Vary - a directorial star was born.
Impeccably dressed and groomed programmer Leonid reacts to the world with restrained disgust, hiding in the burrow of a neat bachelor's life.
But a cast-iron baba descends on the house, an unfair hand of the punitive authorities falls on the hero's head, and he begins a senseless run through Kafkaesque spaces and situations.
"Sometimes it's useful to work not only with debutants," triumphantly declared producer Sabina Yeremeyeva from the stage, taking the prize.
Critics saw it differently: in their opinion, Sabine simply managed to pull an "internal debutant" out of the ranks of the country's art cinema.
And this is symptomatic - nowadays in our cinema, the bison follow the young people.
And not the other way around.
Documentary film, shot in a way that blows your mind more than an equivalent fictional film.
The author is interested in the screwdriver exploring the electric meter, and a piece of unsalted butter drifting across a cast-iron skillet, all of which turns the story of an unemployed miner, his rare-toothed lover, and her criminal brother into a real canvas of oil.
The winner of the short film competition, Nikolai Sokolov, applies the black and white style of the French New Wave to the world of sleeping districts.
Let the year-round montage tricks in the story about two schoolboys, one of whom dreams of making a bomb, and the other of playing Bach backward, seem strange, but for the rare attempt to poetize the surrounding reality - thank you.
"Three times a year - on the eve of Victory Day, Russia Day and City Day - about ten aircraft of the An-12, Il-18, An-32, An-24 type take off into the sky, equipped with meteorological equipment and technical means of influencing clouds for the duration of the work, and loaded with special environmentally friendly chemicals - liquid nitrogen, granulated carbon dioxide ("dry ice"), meteorological pyropatrons with silver iodide and powdered reagents.
The process looks like this: planes at a distance of 50-100 kilometers from Moscow (depending on the length and power of the rain front) “break up” these clouds with these reagents, and the particles of the substances condense the moisture around them.
As a result, precipitation falls earlier than planned, and exactly where the cloud was affected."
For ten years, work has been underway on a remake of the science fiction film, in which Michael York played the main role.
Recently, Carl Rinsch was appointed as the director (he already has a remake of "The Creatures from the Black Lagoon" in his schedule), who is famous for his advertising commercials.
Previously, the project was associated with the names of Bryan Singer (X-Men), James McTeigue (V for Vendetta) and Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy).
In the plot, the hero, who has turned thirty, is forced to flee from a death sentence, as the society of the future executes all citizens upon reaching this age.
Robert Rodriguez has acquired the rights to the 80s rotoscopic fantasy cartoon and plans to make a big-budget movie out of it.
The original was the result of the joint creative work of director Ralph Bakshi (The Lord of the Rings, 1976) and fantasy artist Frank Frazetta.
The theme of the cartoon was swords, magic, and a large number of drawn breasts.
In it, the warrior Larn saves the princess Tiger and the entire nation from the evil ruler of the ice Nekron.
Rodriguez promises to pay close attention to the creation of non-humans and barbarians on pterodactyls.
George A. Romero will send his zombies on vacation for the time being, as he himself plans to work on a remake of the classic giallo film by Dario Argento.
The heroes will return to the big screen thanks to none other than Michael Bay - the master of action, explosions, and horror remakes.
The director of the remake will be Damin Chen, who will also adapt the script.
Argento and Romero had already collaborated on "Day of the Dead" and had filmed "Two Evil Eyes" together in 1990.
This time, Dario is not directly involved in the project, but his brother Claudio is producing the film and writing the screenplay.
Jennifer Garner and Nick Nolte will join Russell Brand and Helen Mirren in the remake of the comedy "Arthur"
"I wanted to bring more strength to the female character to reflect the situation in China," says Chen.
Chinese women today run major businesses and win Olympic gold.
Gong Li embodies this power."
For the second time in a row, you are playing an imaginary character.
Is it a coincidence?
A pattern.
I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I am presenting two films here (at the Kinotavr and Sochi Film Market - EMRBE).
And in both I play the dream woman.
But... that's how the director saw me, that's how he presented me, and many people probably think that's how I am in real life.
The girl of my dreams.
Your film partner Alexander Yatsenko is completely different from his character.
How did you find common ground? What is it like on the set?
He is absolutely not what he seems at first glance.
At first, I saw him and thought, "Yeah... I'm not just going to have to."
Probably, without human contact, sincere and real, we would not have achieved anything.
And this contact happened with us literally a few minutes after the introduction.
We have become good friends, and I am not afraid to say it.
I told him about all my fears, about all my experiences, about the fact that I was afraid that I wouldn't succeed, and I asked him for some advice and help, and he gladly gave me this advice and help.
We talked a lot...
I tried to do this because I was very afraid of losing this contact, of losing our mutual understanding.
And so, at the premiere, we watched the whole film holding hands.
How did the filming in Sevastopol go?
Sevastopol is a city where I came for the first time.
I have never been there on tour, nor have I ever been there for a vacation or as a child.
This city has a special magic, a certain character, a certain charisma.
And it's a city you want to come back to.
It has its own provincial charm.
A place where no one is in a hurry and always manages to get everything done.
It seems that it was not difficult for you to play love for this city.
In general, you are extremely natural on screen, which many, frankly, did not expect.
How do you work with roles?
Do emotional scenes come easily to you?
You know, I'm not a professional actor.
And I am, by nature, a very trusting person.
If I come and agree to work with a director, then I am, in fact, entrusting myself to his hands and I want to be a test from which they will mold.
I understand perfectly well that it looks better from the outside, and I, again, ask for tips and talk to the director, for a very long time, not even I talk to him, but he has preliminary conversations with me and explains very clearly and precisely what he needs.
And then, through long, multi-hour rehearsals, we come to the organic nature you are talking about.
And how did you work with the film's director, Klim Shipenko?
I was thrilled with everyone, the operator, the director, the producer, Sasha Yatsenko.
Because I love working with crazy people!
I saw the same thing when I worked with Timur Bekmambetov.
He was ready to not sleep, not eat - and here was exactly such a situation.
Don't sleep, don't eat for days - and still, no matter how loud, no matter how hard.
And if something didn't work out, it was a disaster, and you had to do something urgently to make it work.
In this atmosphere of madness, it is very easy to work.
And I think that when people are so obsessed with what they do, it can't help but fail, because too much energy is being spent.
What scenarios are you rejecting?
What are the criteria for selecting the material you will be working with?
I don't want nonsense, stupid dialogues, films that don't say anything, don't carry anything.
I don't want to work just to appear on screen again.
Do you have any proposals, projects that you plan to work on in the near future?
There are currently no specific proposals or plans.
I'm not the kind of person who draws up schedules.
The script came in, it interested me, and today this premiere happened.

While we are working on the November issue, film festivals are taking place almost continuously in Moscow: the American Film Festival, Amfest, 2nd, and the British Film Festival will soon begin.
And here's the interesting thing: half of my acquaintances are constantly discussing the need to boycott someone, and to support someone else, for some - well, excuse me - very vague reasons.
Moreover, when one of these festivals is solemnly closed with a terrifying Chu4 projection without English subtitles, no one seems to notice anything.
The least you want to do is grumble about it, but if you buy a ticket with money and stay in the theater to watch giant pixels and horizontal figures of actors, then they will continue to show them to you.
And in the meantime, we have no pixels: "Tron: Legacy" (a continuation of the classic film about virtual reality), "Let Me In. The Story" (an American remake of the excellent Swedish film), "Unstoppable" (another approach by Tony Scott to the topic of trains), and a wildly detailed account of how the films about Conan, the barbarian, the destroyer, and the governor were created.

SOCIAL NETWORK
The history of the creation of the Facebook network
David Fincher's new film is, first and foremost, a story about a paradox.
The film tells the story of the invention of Facebook, one of the pioneering tools in the field of the Internet, which united the whole world, drove five friends apart and made its creator, 26-year-old former Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, the youngest billionaire of recent decades.
Jesse Eisenberg in the lead role is just as great as our conflicted genius, an emotionally isolated social outcast with an unpredictable set of motivations and attachments.
Zuckerberg is launching the site for a variety of reasons: partly because of his anger at the world, partly because of his interest in sports, and partly just because it's "cool."
The very idea and its implementation may seem spontaneous and impulsive, but the actual course of events suggests a clear calculation and a well-thought-out business plan.
The strengths of The Social Network become apparent from the first frames, particularly in the scene before the opening credits, where Zuckerberg is talking in a bar with his ex-girlfriend Erica (Mara): the sharp, tough dialogue by screenwriter Aaron Sorkin is already strong here and does not soften until the very end.
The same goes for Fincher's direction: relatively restrained (except for the Winklevoss twins, who were played by actors who didn't look alike.
The face of one of them was superimposed on the other using computer graphics.
At the same time as Zuckerberg, Natalie Portman studied at Harvard.
Rooney Mara has been cast in the lead role in Fincher's next film, "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo".
Director David Fincher
IN ROLES: Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Rune Mara, Justin Timberlake, Armie Hammer, Joshua Pence
STORY: The moody and introverted Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, having turned a corner in his personal life, takes on the ambitious task of creating a fundamentally new social network.
As Facebook's popularity grows, relationships with a few close friends begin to deteriorate and eventually lead to legal proceedings.
The color palette plays its role: warm, sometimes sunny, even in the dark it remains cozy, it maneuvers between two tangled chains of events and two separate legal disputes.
Outside of the endless stream of discussions, not much happens in the film: not a single death, not a single murder, and all of Zuckerberg's legal troubles are unlikely to warrant even an additional paragraph for his sparse Wikipedia page.
What attracted 49-year-old Sorkin and 48-year-old Fincher to this story, which is not very generous with details?
After watching, there is a persistent feeling that "The Social Network" is a portrait of our time, and understatement in this case is an important artistic technique.
Just about twenty years ago, Wall Street was doing pretty much the same thing, only on a larger scale - with space egos and big deals.
Now that the daily capacity has increased even more, the policy is no longer implemented at board meetings or in sandboxes.
Zuckerberg wants to be special, he dreams of becoming the center of attention.
Severin (Garfield) is hurt that his best friend has a new best friend (Timberlake) and now he has no one to play with.
The Winklevosses (Hammer and Pence), meanwhile, are kicking up their heels: who said that rich, beautiful, and athletic people can't also be smart?
(This line particularly amuses Fincher.)
If desired, a black comedy could have been made from the "Social Network".
Zuckerberg is obsessed with the idea of popularity and leadership, but what is more in his case - positive or negative?
And what social consequences will its invention entail?
Is he a swindler?
Or a clever manipulator?
Fincher and Sorkin will never close the book if there is even the slightest hint of something like that.
But it won't even be necessary here: in their version of history, it doesn't matter at all.
"What is it like to feel beautiful?" is asked in the song "VaBu Wot'te A Vsp Map" by Tre VeaNez, which precedes the credits.
The hero doesn't know.
The film suggests an answer.
Zuckerberg is a representative of the lost online generation, which has a weak idea of beauty and even less of feelings.
A well-made drama of character about a high-profile legal case in the internet era
In the early 17th century, when Ivan Susanin lived, surnames for people of humble origin had not yet begun to appear.
They used to call him "such-and-such, such-and-such's son".
That is, patronymics - nicknames based on the father's name - were in use.
But sometimes, for example in the case of a father's second marriage, the matronymic - a nickname based on the mother's name - was used.
Susannin is just such a case: "Ivan, son of Susannin".
The serfs of small landowners really did go without surnames for a long time - why do you need one when you have 20 souls and everyone is always in sight.
But the owners of thousands of estates were forced to give their peasants surnames.
So, the serfs of Prince Andrei Cherkassky already had surnames en masse at the beginning of the 18th century.
In the 19th century, even small landowners did not keep the peasant on the land, but let him go on a lease - let him earn a living with his craft and pay the landowner.
Such a peasant was given a passport, where the surname had to be written.
By the time serfdom was abolished in Central Russia, 55% of serfs had been released on a fee.
This means that they already had surnames.
Capital city criminologists have flown in to investigate the explosion in Novosibirsk
Criminalists from the central office and staff from the forensic center arrived in Novosibirsk to help with the investigation of the gas explosion in a house on Lineynaya Street, 39, reports NGS.
According to the investigation, the defendants, Irina Urbakh and Evgeny Kavun, posing as employees of the fictitious organization "Mezhregiongaz", inspected and repaired gas equipment.
They used low-quality parts, worked carelessly, and, on the contrary, inflated the prices for their services, the agency reports, citing an informed source.
On the eve of the tragedy on Lineynaya, a man and a woman visited three apartments in house No. 39, where they changed the hoses of the plates.
For example, in one of the apartments they installed a water hose instead of a gas one.
However, Kavun denies this.
According to him, this is impossible, everything was certified.
As a result of their actions, a gas-air mixture leaked and exploded in one of the apartments.
Two entrances collapsed - one completely, the other partially.
This led to a significant collapse of the building, which resulted in the deaths of 13 people.
Earlier, suspects in the case of the explosion of a house in Novosibirsk were arrested.
The scammers themselves came from Omsk.
In St. Petersburg, it was possible to avoid a sea flood

Specialists were able to prevent the flood thanks to the closure of the dam the day before.
On Friday, the threat of flooding in St. Petersburg increased dramatically due to bad weather in the city.
The sea flood was prevented thanks to the timely closure of the dam.
The potential flood could be the 32nd in a row, reports the St. Petersburg publication Nev.Tuday.
The water level reached 184 centimeters, but thanks to the closure of the valves in the Gulf of Finland, the water remained at 168 centimeters, which is only seven centimeters above the lower threshold of the dangerous flood level (from 161 to 210 centimeters).
Weather conditions were complicated by gusty winds, the speed of which sometimes reached 20-25 meters per second.
Now the dam has been reopened, the water level has dropped, and ships can once again sail in the Gulf of Finland.
It should be noted that the water level situation is being monitored by ten meteorological stations on the eastern side of the Gulf of Finland.
This allows for the prevention of flooding, which can follow from the strengthening of the wind.
In Turkey, 8 people have been arrested in the case of defects in the collapsed buildings
In the Turkish province of Shanlyurfa, 8 people were arrested in connection with the construction defects found in buildings that collapsed as a result of the earthquake.
According to Armenpress, Habertürk reports this.
As a result of the earthquake that occurred in Turkey on February 6, more than 20 thousand people died.
The number of injured exceeds 80 thousand.
It is noted that the earthquake is the strongest since 1939.
The earthquake, which measured 7.7 on the Richter scale, was followed by hundreds of aftershocks that were felt not only in 10 provinces of Turkey, but also in neighboring Syria.
Pashinyan sent congratulatory messages to the Supreme Leader of Iran and the President of the country
Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan sent congratulatory messages to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Seyyed Ali Khamenei, and to the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ebrahim Raisi, on the occasion of the 44th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.
Armenpress reported this in the Department of Information and Public Relations of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia.
In a message to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution of Iran, Seyed Ali Khamenei, it is said:
"Your Eminence,
I warmly congratulate you on the 44th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution.
The warm and friendly relations between Armenia and Iran, with centuries-old roots, rich history and traditions, are of particular importance for our two countries.
More than three decades have passed since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Republic of Armenia and the Islamic Republic of Iran, and we are witnessing sustainable and stable bilateral cooperation.
I am confident that the Armenian-Iranian friendship, forged in an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust, will achieve even greater successes for the benefit of the peoples of Armenia and Iran.
Taking this opportunity, I wish you good health and many years of life."
In a congratulatory message sent to Ebrahim Raisi, it says: "Your Excellency, please accept our heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to you and the friendly people of Iran on the occasion of the 44th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution.
Based on centuries-old history and mutual respect, the unbreakable Armenian-Iranian relations are of particular importance to the Republic of Armenia.
I am confident that, as a result of joint efforts, we will be able to take interstate cooperation to a new level, the multisectoral agenda of which will be even more expanded for the benefit of the well-being of our two friendly peoples and the security of our countries.
Emphasizing the importance of our views on establishing and strengthening regional peace and stability, I confirm the official invitation addressed to you during my visit to Tehran last year to visit Armenia.
Taking this opportunity, I wish you new achievements, and the friendly people of Iran - a stable peace."

Caption for the video: WW2 bomb explosion in Great Yarmouth is caught on camera
In England, in the port city of Great Yarmouth, an aerial bomb from World War II exploded on Friday, which sappers tried to neutralize.
A powerful explosion was heard dozens of kilometers away, but there were no casualties.
Norfolk County Police announced that, although the explosion was unplanned, no one from the military involved in defusing the bomb was injured.
"The device detonated shortly after work began to neutralize it.
Fortunately, the entire crew is safe.
The agencies have begun assessing the damage," said Nick Davison, assistant chief of police in Norfolk, to journalists.
Local residents write on social networks that the explosion shook houses at a distance of 24 km.

A 250-kilogram bomb was found during construction work on the bank of the Yar River, at the mouth of which, on the shore of the North Sea, stands Great Yarmouth.
Before attempting to defuse the bomb, the sappers built a protective wall of sand around it, and a cordon, inside which no outsiders were allowed, was set up at a distance of 200 meters.
Explosives experts initially planned to use a robot to remove the detonator from the bomb on Thursday, but the attempt failed, and then they decided, according to local media, to use the technique of "slow burning" of the explosives.
It was during this burning process that the explosion occurred.
During World War II, the Nazis dropped hundreds of thousands of bombs on Britain.
During the eight-month intensive bombing campaign known as the Blitz, from the autumn of 1940 to the spring of 1941, 450,000 bombs were dropped on Britain.
Among Belarusian researchers, women make up almost 40%
In Belarus, the number of women among researchers is 38.9%, reported Belta, a researcher at the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences, Alesia Solovei.
The proportion of women among candidates of sciences and doctors of sciences is also growing: among candidates of sciences, women account for 41.1%, among doctors of sciences - 21%.
In all fields of science, except for technical ones, the proportion of women exceeded 50%.
The most feminized field of scientific knowledge is medical sciences, in which women account for 64.4%.
Only in technical sciences do men predominate, women make up 26.7%.
In the National Academy of Sciences, the proportion of women among researchers is 49.1% - this is more than in the republic as a whole, by 10.2%.
Among candidates for a doctorate, the proportion of women is 46%, and among doctors of science, it is 20%.
Among the faculty and staff in higher education institutions, more than half are women (57%).
Among the pro-rectors for scientific, educational and pedagogical work, every third is a woman (31.8%), among the deans - 38.7%, deputy deans - 44.6%, heads of departments - 42.5%.
Women are the most numerous among senior lecturers and lecturers - over 60%.
The proportion of women among associate professors in the departments is also high (55.2%).
According to the republican public opinion monitoring conducted by the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences last year, the majority of Belarusians do not support gender stereotypes about women's opportunities in science.
63.5% (56.5% of men and 69% of women) disagree to some extent with the gender stereotype that science is a male domain.
More than half of the country does not hold the view that a woman is less competent as a scientist - 66.1% (59% of men and 71.6% of women).
"The transformation of gender stereotypes in the mass consciousness about women's research competence contributes to attracting young women to science, developing their creative potential, forming a successful role model of a female scientist, including through the transfer of experience and the mentorship institution," noted Alesia Solovei.
February 11 is celebrated annually as the International Day of Women and Girls in Science.
The holiday was established to introduce women and girls to the field of science, to encourage women to pursue scientific careers, and to recognize the achievements of women in science.
According to UNESCO, women make up 30% of the total number of researchers in the world.
The probability of a further increase in the key rate is higher than its decrease
This statement was made by the Chairman of the Bank of Russia, Elvira Nabiullina, following the meeting of its Board of Directors on February 10, which decided to maintain this rate at 7.50%.
The head of the regulator, in particular, noted that important changes have occurred recently.
On the one hand, the conditions for foreign trade have noticeably worsened - the prices for Russian oil have fallen.
On the other hand, the situation in the economy is better than the October forecast.
The shift in the structure of demand continues: consumption remains restrained, private investment slows down, but budgetary expenditures are growing.
At the same time, inflationary risks have generally increased.
"Therefore, this year, the probability of a rate increase exceeds the probability of a rate decrease.
The appropriateness of changing the rate will be determined by the development of the situation," said E. Nabiullina.
In addition to the more pronounced impact of fiscal policy, it noted three risks.
First, a rapid increase in consumption in the face of heightened inflationary expectations, if the factors that are holding back consumer activity weaken.
Secondly, there is an increasing shortage of workers and a lag in the growth of labor productivity compared to the growth of wages.
There are also still risks of additional tightening of sanctions.
Speaking about the regulator's future decisions, the Chairman of the Bank of Russia noted that, despite the earlier noted strengthening of pro-inflationary factors, the inflation forecast for this year remains at 5 - 7%.
According to her, this may require a higher trajectory for the key rate than was expected in October.
In the updated forecast of the Central Bank for this and next year, the ranges for the average key rate have been increased by half a percentage point, to 7.0-9.0% per annum for 2023 and 6.5 - 7.5% per annum for 2024.
"This does not rule out the possibility of a rate cut this year, but its likelihood and scale have diminished.
On the contrary, the likelihood has increased that some rate increase may be needed in 2024 for inflation to be close to the 4% target," concluded the head of the Bank of Russia.
The Bank of Russia has approved the requirements for the procedure for creating special closed-end mutual investment funds (PIFs) consisting of blocked foreign securities.
The regulator informs that such papers will be removed from the composition of the current retail mutual funds.
This will allow the management of remaining liquid assets and the resumption of operations with investment shares.
If a retail mutual fund contains more than 10% of locked-up securities, the management company must allocate them to a separate closed mutual fund by September 1, 2023.
Each shareholder will be issued shares of the new fund in an amount equal to the shares of the main fund.
It is also possible to change the status of a retail fund to a closed one.
For funds with a share of blocked securities of less than 10%, the new requirements are not mandatory.
But the management company has the right to allocate blocked assets into a separate closed mutual fund.
In addition, a requirement is introduced to inform shareholders about the consequences of withdrawing blocked securities into a special mutual fund.
In the future, if such securities are sold, the management companies are obliged to pay investment shareholders at least 90% of the funds received on a quarterly basis, according to a statement from the Bank of Russia.
In addition to summarizing the industry, experts also gave a forecast for the current year.
According to data from the Promsvyazbank Analytics and Expertise Center, in 2022, passenger turnover in air transport in Russia decreased by 6.3%, and passenger transportation decreased by 14.2%.
The volume of passenger transportation amounted to 95.2 million people, and the passenger turnover was 228.0 billion passenger-kilometers.
International passenger traffic amounted to 17.2 million people, which is 26.7% lower than the previous year, and domestic passenger traffic amounted to 78.0 million people (-10.9%).
PSB analysts note that the industry's relative stability was influenced by government support programs.
In 2022, a program to stimulate domestic tourism was in effect, which was allocated 38.8 billion rubles.
Tourists could receive a partial refund for tours with flights prepared by Rostourism.
In addition, several state support programs were implemented to ensure the accessibility of air transport, including subsidies for the transportation of citizens, the development of regional transportation, etc., with a total budget of more than 27.5 billion rubles.
In the second quarter of 2022, the government decided to allocate an additional 100 billion rubles to airlines and recapitalize Aeroflot with 52.5 billion rubles.
"Despite the sanctions pressure on the Russian aviation industry, as a result of the development of domestic tourism and the opening of new international destinations, as well as the continuation of state subsidies to the industry (so far, 25.3 billion rubles have been allocated), in 2023, passenger traffic, according to our estimates, will increase by 6.4%, to 101.2 million people (domestic passenger traffic will amount to 91.1 million people), according to the forecast of Rosaviatsia, up to 103.0 million people," analysts from PSB share their forecasts.
Terrorist attack in Jerusalem, a 6-year-old child died
Two people, including a 6-year-old child, were victims of a terrorist attack in Jerusalem: a car crashed into a bus stop at high speed.
Six other people were injured.
The driver of the car was shot on the spot.
Later it was revealed that he was a 31-year-old Palestinian from East Jerusalem.
His actions were classified as a terrorist attack by law enforcement agencies, the terrorist's relatives were detained, and the house was sealed.
At the same time, according to reports from Israeli media, the attacker had mental health problems, and he was only discharged from the hospital this week.
Austria is once again tightening controls at the border with Hungary after another influx of migrants in recent months.
Officials say many people are staying in cars at the border waiting to cross into Austria.
This is a signal to the Austrian authorities that they have already gone through the asylum procedure in Hungary.
Based on existing agreements, Austria believes that migrants are obliged to remain in the country where the request was made.
At the same time, the Austrian authorities consider it wrong to automatically send back to Hungary those who want to cross the border: many migrants fall victim to smugglers and find themselves between two border posts without the right to return to Hungary.
That is why, according to the police, increased control is needed.
The decision to tighten checks by Vienna followed a pledge by European Union leaders to allocate more funds for cameras, drones and watchtowers to guard the bloc's borders.
According to the Frontex agency, last year the number of illegal migrants who arrived in the EU and applied for refugee status exceeded the 2016 figures for the first time and amounted to more than 330 thousand.
The cargo "Progress 83" successfully docked with the ISS
The automatic resupply ship Progress 83 successfully docked with the International Space Station on Saturday at 3:45 GMT, completing a two-day orbital flight.
The docking occurred at an altitude of 269 statute miles over the southern part of the Pacific Ocean.
The docking was broadcast by the NASA Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas.
In Russia, the docking was controlled by specialists from the Flight Control Center.
The cargo ship was welcomed by cosmonauts Sergei Prokopiev, Dmitry Petelin and Anna Kikina from the ISS.
The Progress MS-22 spacecraft delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS, including 720 kg of refueling fuel, 420 kg of water, as well as about 1,354 kg of dry cargo.
In addition, the ship delivered food for Russian cosmonauts.
Progress 83 successfully launched from the Russian Baikonur Cosmodrome on Thursday.
At the same time, Roscosmos reported a depressurization of the Progress MS-21, which was prepared for undocking from the ISS and further sinking on February 18.
As the company's press service clarified, the ship's transition hatch was immediately closed: "Progress MS-21" was isolated from the general volume of the ISS.
The reasons for its depressurization are being investigated."
The TsUP also reported that the ISS crew is not in danger: "The temperature and pressure on board the station are normal.
The lives and health of the crew are not in danger, they are feeling well."
"There have been more cases of maternity tourism."
How pregnant Russians got stuck in Argentina
The Argentine Migration Service has begun to suspend and cancel the residence permits of Russians who obtained them through the birth of a child, but did not remain to live in the country.
Earlier, the authorities of the republic refused entry to the country to several pregnant Russian women, who were suspected of having come for the purpose of "maternity tourism".
On February 11, they were still allowed into Argentina by a court decision.
Read more in the article "Gazeta.Ru".
The Argentine Migration Service has begun to suspend and cancel the residence permits of Russians who obtained them through the birth of a child, but did not remain to live in the country.
This was reported by the director of the service, Florencia Carignano, to the C5N television channel.
"What we are doing is suspending the residence permits of those Russians who have come to get a residence permit because their child is Argentinean, but have spent more time outside (Argentina) than inside (the country)", she explained.
According to her, when the issue of Argentine citizenship for a Russian citizen is considered in court, the migration service will submit data that the residence permit was suspended because this person "spent a month in Argentina and never came back".
Carignano warned that Russians who received a residence permit after the birth of a child and left may have it revoked.
Against this backdrop, on February 9, it became known that three pregnant Russian women were "stuck" at the airport in Argentina due to a refusal to enter the country.
According to the head of the consular department of the Russian embassy in Argentina, Georgy Polina, the diplomatic mission links the incident with the fact that the authorities of the republic could consider the information provided by the girls upon entry to be incomplete or false.
One of them arrived on February 7, and two more arrived in the evening of February 8, reports RIA Novosti.
The diplomat emphasized that more pregnant women have flown to Argentina, but these three were specifically issued a prescription not to enter the country.
"They were not allowed into the country in accordance with the migration law, where one of the grounds for not allowing entry into the country is the provision of incomplete, false, or distorted information," Polin said.
On Saturday, February 11, the Argentine migration service, by court decision, allowed pregnant Russian citizens into the country, reported lawyer Christian Rubilar.
"An hour ago, they were all allowed to enter Argentina," TASS quotes him as saying.
Rubilar noted that the migration service changed its decision after the court ruling.
It is easier for foreign parents of a child born in Argentina to obtain a passport of the republic.
It allows for short-term travel to 171 countries without visas, including EU countries, the UK, and Japan, notes RBK.
In early January 2023, The Guardian wrote about a "boom in maternity tourism" to Argentina among Russians.
According to Polina, in 2022, from 2 thousand to 2.5 thousand citizens of the Russian Federation moved to the republic.
Many of them, the diplomat noted, are Russian women who plan to give birth there.
"In 2023, this number could grow to 10 thousand," he said.
In turn, Carignano previously stated that in 2022, about 10.5 thousand Russian citizens arrived in Argentina, and over the past few months, more than 5.8 thousand pregnant women.
On February 9, it became known how the prices for renting housing in St. Petersburg have changed.
It has fallen by 10%.
It is known that across the country, rent has become 25% more expensive, reports Patrol Peterburg with reference to RBK.
The average monthly rent for an apartment in St. Petersburg at the beginning of 2023 was 27,000 rubles.
A one-bedroom apartment cost 25,000 rubles per month, a studio apartment cost 22,000 rubles per month, and a two-bedroom apartment cost 36,000 rubles per month.
Experts believe that this trend may change by the spring, when many citizens who have traveled abroad will return home.
The reasons for the interrogation of women in a foreign country have become known.
The Argentine Migration Service did not allow six pregnant Russian women into the country, as the purpose of their visit turned out to be false.
This is reported by TASS, citing the Todo Noticias television channel.
For five hours, pregnant women were asked questions about the purpose of their visit.
Most of them admitted that they came to a foreign country to give birth.
In connection with this, representatives of the country did not let the Russian women into Argentina.
As the publication specifies, the migration service has a procedure for dealing with suspicions of "false" travelers.
For example, if it is noticeable that a woman is in the 33rd week of pregnancy, she does not have a return ticket to Russia, and she also cannot clearly explain where she is going on vacation, then she immediately falls under suspicion from the migration service.
Moreover, specialists clarify that it is difficult to be a traveler "in such conditions".
The artist's decision to leave the theater was planned.
The laureate of the State Prize of the Russian Federation, Alexander Filipenko, stated that the decision of the Moscow City Council Theater not to renew his contract was planned, and that everything was agreed upon in advance with the management.
He spoke about this in an interview with the Interfax agency.
In productions in which he took part, he invited artists from the second cast.
The People's Artist of the Russian Federation clarified that his contract ended in 2022.
All the details were agreed upon with the theater representatives a long time ago.
Moreover, everyone knew that the star was not going to renew the contract.
Filipenko noted that the management agreed to the meeting and prepared all the documents.
He assures that "he did not let anyone down".
In addition, it became known that the artist emigrated from Russia.
He flew to his heiress in Latvia.
Filipenko is going to undergo "long-term treatment" in a foreign country.
According to the publication, at the moment, the film actor is working as a guest actor at a Moscow theater.
According to the publication, the artist played in the Moscow Council in such performances as "Shakespeare's Hamlet" and "The Taming of the Shrew", "Uncle Vanya", as well as "Three Sisters".
On Friday, February 10, 340 thousand cubic meters of snow were removed from the private sector in the Kalininsky District.
This information was shared by the city hall.
At the moment, there are more than four hundred private sector streets in the Kalininsky district, from which snow must be cleared by spring.
The roads will be cleaned in two stages.
The first will end on February 15, and the second will run from March 1 to April 15.
114 pieces of special equipment and 123 workers will take part in the cleanup.
Authorities said contractors are facing snow removal on the road by residents of the houses.
Kirkorov won a lawsuit against a fisherman
In the lawsuit, the man claimed that the artist's construction was illegal, but he did not appear at the hearing.
A fisherman sued musician Philip Kirkorov over an allegedly illegally installed pier on his dacha in the Moscow region.
This is reported by the Fifth Channel.
However, the Saratov fisherman did not succeed in winning the case.
The Odintsovo City Court considered the complaint against the singer. According to the lawyer, documents and design projects were presented in court, which confirmed the legality of all structures installed on the territory of the celebrity's home.
As Alexander Dobrovinskoy, head of the law firm, clarifies, the construction of the pier left the plaintiff no chance to go fishing.
The application for the performer was submitted on January 11.
The star lawyer jokingly said that the man probably planned to catch fish exclusively from the artist's home.
Ironically, Dobrovinskoy clarified that he would ask Kirkorov to provide the plaintiff with his balcony for fishing.
He emphasized that from that place it is possible to continue casting a spinning rod.
A sleep specialist named the causes of sleep problems
Sleep specialist Sofia Cherkasova spoke about food products and habits that interfere with healthy sleep.
As the specialist noted, sleep problems often occur due to products containing caffeine.
This primarily refers to tea, coffee, chocolate, and any cocoa-containing desserts.
Their use before bed should be limited, as they not only interfere with falling asleep, but also make sleep "broken", which means it does not allow the body to fully recover.
According to the doctor, it is best to stop consuming caffeine-containing products 6-8 hours before bedtime.
Otherwise, they contribute to a decrease in the threshold of excitability of the nervous system and, as a result, difficulties with falling asleep occur.
Alcohol also negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
The doctor clarifies that small doses of alcoholic beverages help to relax and do not affect sleep.
However, quantities exceeding 36 grams when converted to pure alcohol lead to various sleep disturbances, such as shallow sleep and frequent nighttime awakenings.
In addition, to prevent problems with falling asleep, a sleep specialist recommends avoiding spicy food in large portions.
Large volumes and spicy foods contribute to an increase in body temperature, which negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
For healthy sleep, not only the external temperature regime must be observed: the optimal air temperature is 18-20 degrees - but also the absence of an elevated body temperature.
According to Cherkasova, it is not worth abusing heavy food before bedtime, as it will not allow the body to fully recover and rest: it will be forced to spend energy on digestion.
The doctor also reminded that lack of healthy sleep and accumulated sleep deprivation affect the quality of life and usual activities, so it is extremely important to adhere to a sleep and rest schedule and allow the body to recover.
Bloomberg named Trump's competitor in the upcoming presidential elections: In the world: Politics: INFOX.ru
According to the agency, the main competitor of the former president in the upcoming elections will be the governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis.
Republican Desantis has not yet officially announced his intention to run for the presidency, but Bloomberg sources report that he is already preparing for the primaries.
According to the agency, Desantis' team is already recruiting consultants to participate in the presidential elections and is conducting preliminary polls.
In confirmation of this, Bloomberg reports on a planned outdoor meeting for Republican Party leaders and government representatives at the end of February.
The agency reports that the Florida governor's team is seeking support among their Republican colleagues from Iowa, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and other states. Bloomberg experts named DeSantis as the main potential competitor to Donald Trump.
Experts believe that the current governor of Florida is well-known enough that he does not need to start a campaign right now, and they also note his ability to raise money.
Ron DeSantis was a supporter of Donald Trump's candidacy for the presidency in 2017, and he may be his competition in the presidential elections in November 2024.
Donald Trump officially announced his intention to run for president "to make America great again"... during a speech to his supporters in Florida.
The current president, Joe Biden, despite assurances from his team about his intention to participate in the 60th presidential election, stated that there is no firm decision on this issue.
Hundreds of demonstrations against pension reform will take place in France on Saturday
The fourth day of mass protests against pension reform is being held by French trade unions on Saturday.
Hundreds of demonstrations will take place across the country, French media report.
After a slight decrease in the number of protesters on Tuesday compared to the first two "days of mobilization," the unions hope to bring more protesters onto the streets this time, taking into account those citizens who were unable to participate in demonstrations on a weekday.
Law enforcement agencies expect between 600,000 and 800,000 demonstrators across the country, including between 90,000 and 120,000 in Paris, according to media reports.

The largest trade union association, the General Confederation of Labor (VKT), announced 2 million demonstrators.
According to the VCT, 400,000 demonstrators took to the streets in Paris on Tuesday.
Police say there were 57,000 of them.
On the previous day of protests on January 31, the number of demonstrators was estimated by the police to be 1.27 million and 2.8 million according to trade unions.
The next mass protests are planned for February 16.
As reported, on January 10, French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne presented the government's draft pension reform, which provides for an increase in the retirement age from 62 to 64 years.
It is expected that the established age threshold for retirement will gradually shift from 62 years to 64 over three months per year, and this process will last until 2030.
The new regime will apply to generations of French people born in September 1961 or after.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced during the 2022 election campaign that he was determined to carry out pension reform before the end of his second presidential term.
On February 6, the French National Assembly began considering the government's draft pension reform.

The depressurization of the "Progress MS-21" occurred on the ISS: February 12, 2023, 00:12
TASS - KAZINFORM - Roscosmos reported a depressurization of the "Progress MS-21", prepared for disconnection from the ISS, reports MIA "Kazinform" with reference to TASS.
"The hull of the Progress MS-21 transport cargo ship, which is scheduled to be sunk on February 18, has been depressurized, confirmed telemetry data received at the TsUP," the Roscosmos press service reported.
It is noted that at the moment it is isolated from the general volume of the station.
The causes of the incident are being investigated, and it did not affect the docking of the cargo ship Progress MS-22 or the further flight program of the ISS.
The situation was commented on by the Executive Director of Roscosmos for manned space programs, Sergei Krikalev.
"A leak of heat transfer fluid occurred in the thermal control system of the cargo ship, which has been docked to the station for several months.
The situation is somewhat similar to what happened to us with the ship ("Soyuz MS-22" - TASS) in mid-December," he said, noting that the commission that analyzed the incident with "Soyuz" concluded that the leak was caused by a micrometeoroid.
Roscosmos will conduct an analysis to ensure that there are no problems during the next launches.
"We need to conduct a thorough analysis to make sure that this cause does not apply to similar designs on future launches.
This is the most important task that will now be before us," he said.
According to the executive director, an analysis will be conducted in terms of the ship's preparation for launch, the materials that were used, and the technologies that were used in assembling the radiator.
The same analysis was carried out in the case of the damaged radiator of the Soyuz MS-22 spacecraft.
"The most important thing is to make sure that this is not some kind of systematic error," added Krikalev.
The executive director clarified that on Saturday, a commission began work, which will analyze all possible causes.
"The ship was supposed to be undocked and deorbited two days before the launch of the Soyuz spacecraft ("Soyuz MS-23" - TASS), so there will be no serious consequences for the crew's actions, for the crew's work... From this point of view, it will not affect the program," Krikalev noted.
The "Progress MS-21" truck was launched from Baikonur on a Soyuz-2.1a carrier rocket on October 26.
Two days later, it docked with the small research module "Search" of the Russian segment of the ISS.
The ship delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS.
NASA has named the place of depressurization of the "Progress"
The depressurization of the cargo ship Progress MS-21 on the International Space Station (ISS) occurred in the thermal control system.
This was reported by a representative of the American Mission Control Center (MCC) during negotiations with the ISS crew, broadcast by NASA.
Now, according to NASA, the leak of cooling liquid from Progress has stopped.
NASA believes that all of the coolant has completely leaked out.
"This morning we had a leak of coolant from the thermal control system into space, the coolant leak has stopped," said a representative of the American CUP (quoted by Interfax).
Previously, the Progress circuit was isolated due to a leak.
Roscosmos reported that the cosmonauts are not in danger.
The Progress MS-22 docked with the ISS today, February 11, and it will be taken out of orbit, according to the plan, on February 18.
The coordinator of strategic communications at the American National Security Council, John Kirby, refused to announce a possible trip of US President Joe Biden to Ukraine.

The head of the city of Serpukhov, Sergei Nikitenko, made a working tour of the territories.
Together with representatives of management organizations, he inspected the condition of apartment buildings and residential buildings.
The addresses from which the most requests from residents were received were placed under the strictest control.
- Many of the comments are well-founded and concern, first and foremost, the cleaning of the entrances and the maintenance of common areas.

The Deputy General Director of RZD suggested that the Governor of Irkutsk Oblast should develop new sales channels
The Irkutsk region needs to continue to develop alternative sales channels, in addition to the Far East.
This includes the domestic market and the ports of the Western direction, including the Azov-Black Sea basin.
This proposal was made by the Deputy General Director of RZD, Alexei Shilo, at a meeting with the Governor, Igor Kobzev, reported by the regional government on February 10, 2023.
As last year's practice showed, even despite the geographical location of the Irkutsk region, this decision can be extremely effective.
It is important that the logistics services of companies constantly interact with our "adjacent parties" (ports, operators, sea transport) and find optimal pricing conditions for transporting their products according to new schemes, emphasized Aleksey Shilo.
The governor noted the importance of stable product shipments, the Irkutsk region is one of the richest regions in Russia in terms of mineral resources and has significant reserves of hard and brown coal.
About 25 enterprises are engaged in coal mining in the region.
The instability of exporting products has a negative impact on the financial and economic activities of coal mining companies.
Igor Kobzev also emphasized that the Irkutsk region is an export-oriented region, so it is necessary to increase the size of monthly quotas for the transportation of timber and metallurgical products produced in the region to a level that ensures the stable operation of such enterprises.
- Understanding the importance of the Irkutsk region as an industrial center, we, for our part, will try to do everything to provide support in terms of transport volumes.
If there are additional volumes of shipments to the domestic market, then we are also ready to provide assistance in this direction, said Aleksey Shilo.
Konstantin Zaytsev held a meeting with the activists of the villages of Granovshchina and Homutovo
At the request of the head of the region, Igor Kobzev, the Chairman of the Government of Priangarsky, Konstantin Zaytsev, worked in the villages of Granovshchina and Khomutovo, Irkutsky District, today.
In the village of Granovshchina, the Chairman of the Government inspected the work of a new educational institution - the Granovsky School, which was opened in September 2022.
The facility was built as part of the federal project "Modern School" of the national project "Education".
The following facilities are located in eight school blocks: classrooms, a dining hall, a kitchen, an assembly hall, two gyms, club rooms, a library, administrative offices, toilets, and common recreation areas, as well as a medical block.
240.8 million rubles were allocated from the federal budget for construction, more than 512 million rubles - regional funds, and more than 72 million rubles - municipal funds.
In addition, a regional subsidy was allocated for the purchase of equipment in the amount of 64.2 million rubles.
After the opening, in addition to children from the village of Granovshchina, students from the Urikovsky school, which was undergoing major repairs, also attended the school.
More than 100 teachers lead the classes, of which almost 90 are subject teachers.
In 2022, the school was allocated a bus, purchased by the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation under a federal program.
Capital repairs of the Khomutovskaya Secondary School No. 2 began in 2022.
Elementary school students were distributed to Homutovskaya School No. 1, while the older students attend the second building of School No. 2.
According to the renovation plan, the roof, engineering systems, windows, and related elements will be replaced, the facade will be repaired, and the interior of the premises will be renovated.
An important component of the major repair is the reconstruction of the heat point with water heating, which was replaced by dry heat.
The cost of all work is more than 80 million rubles.
The renovation is in its final stages, there are problems with connecting to the power grid - an increase in capacity is needed, work is being done with the power supplier.
In addition, in Granovshchina and in Khomutovo, Konstantin Zaytsev held a meeting with citizens, some of whom had illegally connected their homes to the electrical grid.
It was decided that the network company will organize a personal reception next week to legally resolve these issues.
Very often, the issue of stable electricity supply is the main condition when buying a house, because the population increasingly uses electricity for heating.
Therefore, sellers sometimes illegally connect homes to nearby networks, which is already grounds for disconnecting the power supply.
Therefore, now network companies in those territories where active construction is underway, should pay special attention to this issue, emphasized Konstantin Zaitsev.
Anatoly Prokopiev assessed the effectiveness of state support measures for peasant-farmer households in the UOB

The farm is engaged in the cultivation and fattening of dairy cattle.
In 2014, a grant was received for the development of a family dairy farm for 60 heads.
Today, the farm has a herd of 150 cattle.
For many years, potatoes have also been grown here.
The head of the KFH tries to create all the necessary conditions for work and living for the team.

With this money, a tractor trailer, two press-pickers, and a mower were purchased.
The head of the farm increases the number of livestock every year and increases the gross production of meat.
In addition, the KFH sows annual fodder crops on an area of 40 hectares.
Stalin Mogzoev plans to open a fattening site.
After visiting three farms, the head of the district noted that state support measures are effective, necessary, and necessary.
The government of Irkutsk region pays great attention to agriculture.
Therefore, state support should not only be maintained, but also increased and improved.
We, in turn, must be the guarantor of food security.
Agricultural producers in the district are fulfilling this role with honor, emphasized Anatoly Prokopiev.
The border crossing between Armenia and Turkey has been opened for the first time in decades to deliver humanitarian aid
The Margara-Alijan border point on the border of Turkey and Armenia was opened for the first time in three decades to deliver humanitarian aid to those affected by the earthquake.
This is reported by Turkish and Armenian media.
The same crossing was used to deliver humanitarian aid from Turkey to Armenia after the devastating earthquake of 1988, notes the Turkish agency "Anadolu".
On Saturday, Armenia sent five trucks with 100 tons of food, medicine, water, and other emergency aid packages to the city of Adiyaman in southern Turkey, reported Serdar Kılıç, Ankara's special representative for Armenian-Turkish negotiations.
He expressed gratitude to the Vice Speaker of the Armenian Parliament Ruben Rubinyan and the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Armenia Vaan Kostanyan.
"I will always remember the help provided by the people of Armenia to alleviate the suffering of our people in the earthquake-stricken region," Kılıç wrote on his Twitter page.
The press secretary of the Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Vaan Unanyan, in turn, reported that trucks with humanitarian aid crossed the border through the Margara bridge and are heading to the region affected by the earthquake.
As reported by Public Radio of Armenia, the last time a car crossed the Margara Bridge was 30 years ago, in 1993.
Since then, the Armenian-Turkish land border has been closed.
The Turkish agency Anadolu cites other data and writes that the Margara-Alijan border point was last used for the delivery of humanitarian aid to Armenia to address the consequences of the devastating earthquake of 1988.
Then, aid collected through the Turkish Red Crescent was sent to the disaster zone in Armenia.
Earlier, Armenia sent 27 rescuers to Turkey and another 29 rescuers to Syria to the areas affected by the earthquake.
According to the latest data, more than 25 thousand people died in Turkey and Syria from the devastating earthquake that occurred on Monday.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reported on February 11 that 21,848 deaths have been reported in Turkey.
The Syrian side reported 3,553 fatalities.
Relations between Turkey and Armenia are clouded mainly by the fact that Ankara refuses to recognize the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire, and also supported Baku during the First and Second Karabakh Wars.
Recently, Yerevan and Ankara have made a number of attempts to normalize relations.
In 2021, Armenia and Turkey appointed special representatives who met several times in Vienna to discuss normalization issues.
In February 2022, commercial air traffic resumed between Yerevan and Istanbul after a two-year break.
In July 2022, Ankara and Yerevan agreed to open the land border for citizens of third countries as soon as possible.

In particular, he said that he was impressed by the player's performance at the recent World Cup.
According to him, the 22-year-old midfielder will be an excellent addition to the "blue" team, as he knows how to play in different positions.
"Fernandez is Makelele plus Lampard.
If you need him to play in the position of Makelele, then he can play there very well.
This guy also has a good goal sense, a good shot from outside the penalty area, so if you need him to play as a striker, like Lampard or Essien, he can do it," Crespo told British media.

Forecast for the match of the Club World Cup "Real" - "Al-Hilal" on February 11, 2023
On February 11, the final of the Club World Cup in football will be held at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in the Moroccan city of Rabat.
In the match for the trophy, Real Madrid and Al-Hilal from Saudi Arabia will meet.
The game will start at 22.00 Moscow time, and the live broadcast will be shown on the matchtv.ru website and the Match! Football 2 channel at 21.55 Moscow time.
Analysts from the bookmaker company BETSITI consider "blancos" to be huge favorites: you can bet on Real's victory in regular time with a coefficient of 1.28, the probability is approximately 77%.
The success of the nominal guests is available for 11.0 (8%).
Even a draw is offered at a noticeably lower quote of 6.10 (15%).
Do you believe that the teams will not reveal the strongest in 90 minutes?
A bet of 1000 rubles on a "peaceful" outcome in the event of a win will bring 6100 rubles.
You can bet on the triumph of the Madrid team, taking into account extra time and a series of penalties, for 1.14, this market on "Al-Hilal" is going for 5.80.
The team from Saudi Arabia is on its way to the final, having overcome two rounds, beating the Moroccan "Vidad" in a penalty shootout and the Brazilian "Flamengo" in regular time (3:2).
You can bet that the underdog will not lose to the Europeans in 90 minutes for 3.90.
Analysts are anticipating a high number of goals: total over 2.5 balls is available for 1.53, TM 2.5 - for 2.60.
Blancos are clearly superior to their opponent in class, whose squad, according to the statistical website Transfermarkt, is only 39.6 million euros.
For comparison: the Real roster is valued at 849 million euros.
In addition, to the horror of "Al-Hilal", the main striker of the Madrid team and the current holder of the "Golden Ball" Karim Benzema will recover by the final.
But even without the Frenchman, Real is performing well in this tournament: in the semi-finals, they defeated the Egyptian Al-Ahly 4:1.
The Arabs' matches were also quite impressive: in the quarterfinals, they tied 1:1 and won in a penalty shootout, and in the semifinals, they had a dramatic 3:2 victory.
Recommended bet: Real Madrid victory and TB 2.5 for 1.76.
Guberniev said that midfielder Pavel Mamaev has decided to end his playing career.
Well-known television commentator Dmitry Guberniev spoke about the fact that midfielder Pavel Mamaev has decided to end his playing career.
"Now it will be possible to cast a bust in the hero's homeland.
He made a big mistake and for most people he will be remembered not as a footballer, but as a football player who broke the law.
But he is still far from Kokorin.
Because no one has managed to squander their potential as much as Kokorin.
Mamayev, despite all his talents, was periodically noticeable.
I can only wish him good luck and realize himself somewhere else," quotes Guberniev Metaratings.ru.
The last club of the 34-year-old midfielder was Khimki.
The Moscow club did not extend the contract with the midfielder in the summer of 2022.
Mamayev previously played for Torpedo, CSKA, Krasnodar and Rostov.
Mamayev is the champion of Russia, three-time winner of the Russian Cup and two-time winner of the country's Super Cup with CSKA.

A tanker with diesel from a previously Russian-flagged vessel was not allowed into a Spanish port
The Maritime Command of Tarragona of the Main Directorate of the Commercial Fleet under the Ministry of Transport of Spain has banned the entry of the Maersk Magellan ship into the port of the city for the unloading of diesel fuel, since the cargo comes from the Nobel ship, which until July 1, 2022, sailed under the Russian flag, the Spanish Ministry of Transport reported.
"The Maritime Command of Tarragona of the Main Directorate of the Commercial Fleet under the Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Development has prohibited entry into the port of Tarragona for the unloading of diesel fuel on the ship "Maersk Magellan" under the flag of Singapore, because the cargo it is carrying comes from the ship under the Cameroonian flag "Nobel", which until July 1, 2022, sailed under the Russian flag," the ministry said in a statement.
The measure was adopted in accordance with European Union legislation, which prohibits access for any vessel registered under the Russian flag from April 16, 2022, or that has changed its flag after February 24, 2022.
The ministry clarified that the inspection was carried out on February 9, after which the ban was agreed upon.
The ministry recalled that this is not the first time that ships have been banned from entering Spanish ports.
In April 2022, the Black Star, a ship under the Maltese flag, was denied access to the port of Barcelona, which was carrying cargo from a ship under the Russian flag.
In 2022, after the strengthening of anti-Russian sanctions by the EU, the US and the UK imposed restrictions on the supply of Russian petroleum products, and then decided to limit fuel prices.
Since December 5, 2022, a price ceiling on sea oil supplies from Russia has been introduced by unfriendly countries.
At that time, a ceiling was set on Russian oil at $60/barrel.
Also, since December 5, the EU has imposed an embargo on sea oil supplies from Russia.
The problems that pregnant Russian women have had with entering Argentina have been explained
According to the expert, in the wake of the influx of people wanting to have a child in Argentina, the country's authorities have become more attentive to the entry of foreign citizens into their territory.
The difficulties with the entry of pregnant Russian women into Argentina are due to the fact that the country's authorities are not interested in a mass influx of foreigners who want to obtain citizenship for their children and a residence permit for themselves, and then leave.
This is reported by Lenta.ru, citing the professor of St. Petersburg State University, Victor Heifetz, the editor-in-chief of the journal Latin America.
According to him, no country supports such a practice.
He noted that in Argentina, the country is not approved of being turned into a transit point, rather than a final destination.
This applies to those who violate constitutional practice.
As the expert explained, the child will retain Argentine citizenship, but the decision on granting an Argentine passport to the parents after obtaining a residence permit will be made by the court.
If it is found that they did not actually live in Argentina and immediately left, citizenship may be denied.
This applies not only to Russians, but also to citizens of other countries.
Recently, as the specialist pointed out, maternity tours to Argentina are especially popular among Russians and Ukrainians.
Recall that Argentina grants citizenship based on the "right of the soil", that is, if a person was born on its territory.
An Argentine passport opens up the possibility of visa-free travel to 170 countries, including EU countries and the UK.
Earlier it was reported that Argentina began to revoke the residence permits of Russians who received the document through the birth of a child, but left the country.
Buenos Aires is interested in reducing such cases.
It also became known that six pregnant Russian citizens were denied entry into Argentina due to suspicion of providing false information about the purpose of their trip.
In Russia, the opening of hundreds of new fitness clubs is predicted
In Russia, citizens are regaining interest in fitness services, which allows market participants to expand their business.
This year, more than 400 new facilities, mostly small-format, may open in the country.
About 400 new fitness clubs may open in Russia, and their total number may increase by 5 percent.
According to Kommersant, several dozen players may leave the Russian market.
By the end of the year, there will be about 8,600 clubs in Russia.
According to the publication, most of the new clubs are small-scale projects with small initial investments and quick payback.
Such data is provided by representatives of the National Fitness Community.
President of the Association of Fitness Industry Operators Olga Kiselyova, in an interview with the publication, noted that 340-420 new fitness clubs will be small, the rest will occupy an area of more than 500 square meters.
NFS President Elena Silina noted that since 2020, every year has seen more club closures than openings.
Over the past three years, their number has decreased by 37 percent.
Meanwhile, independent analysts cite different figures.
According to Kontur.Focus, over the past three years, the number of organizations with the main type of activity "fitness center work" has grown by 10.1 percent, and now there are 5,12 thousand of them.
The industry suffered heavy losses due to the pandemic, but it began to recover in 2021.
According to 2GIS, there are 4,500 fitness clubs in Russian cities with a population of over one million.
Russians have started paying more attention to physical activity, as evidenced by the increase in attendance at fitness clubs.
In January 2023, attendance increased by 9.3 percent year over year.
As noted by Silina, if the trend is maintained, the industry will return to pre-crisis levels by the end of the year.
The management company from Kirov had its license revoked
The Arbitration Court of the Kirov Region has annulled the license for entrepreneurial activity in the management of apartment buildings, issued to the management company "Zabota".
In the Kirov region, the regional Arbitration Court has annulled the license for entrepreneurial activity in the management of apartment buildings previously issued to the management company "Zabota".
According to the regional State Housing Inspectorate, the court decision was made back in November 2022, but it only came into legal force in February 2023.
The arbitration court has stripped the management company of its license for several times ignoring the orders of the State Housing Inspectorate.
Currently, all facilities that were under the management of "Zabota" have been excluded from the register of licenses for carrying out entrepreneurial activities in the management of apartment buildings.
Their total area was 64.8 thousand square meters.
All the houses are located in the regional center.
The administration of Kirov knows that they are left without a management company.
In accordance with the requirements of Russian legislation, the State Housing Inspectorate informed the mayor about the situation.
Recall that in January 2023, the governor of the Kirov region, Alexander Sokolov, set a task for the employees of the State Housing Inspectorate to liquidate 2/3 of the management companies in the region by the spring, as there are too many of them.
The legality of the governor's demands has caused doubts among the Kirov communists.
They appealed to the regional prosecutor's office and asked to hold Sokolov accountable for administrative violations.
Presumably, the same position could be taken by the Federal Antimonopoly Service.
Antimonopoly officials also reportedly asked the prosecutor's office to check the legality of the actions of the regional leader.
Wildberries will make packages paid at pickup points
The Wildberries marketplace will make bags at order pickup points paid from February 13.
Their cost will range from 6 to 15 rubles.
Now, the packages are provided by the owners of the order pickup points.
In their absence, a fine is imposed.
From Monday, February 13, packages at Wildberries pickup points will no longer be available for free.
Users of the marketplace received a notification stating that buyers who need a bag will have to pay between 6 and 15 rubles for it.
This amount will be debited from the card specified in the personal account.
As the company pointed out, this step will help reduce the use of plastic and will contribute to the preservation of nature.
As follows from the appendix to the offer of services for the delivery of shipments to individuals, the executor, that is, the person who opened the pick-up point, must provide packages free of charge at the request of the client.
They must be made in certain colors and have a specified image.
The bags are purchased at the expense of the owners of the PVZ, and if this obligation is not fulfilled, a fine of 10,000 rubles is imposed for each violation.
Previously, Wildberries customers accused the platform of deducting money from cards whose data had previously been removed from the personal account.
As buyers fear, this is associated with great risks to safety.
The support service, in turn, explained that this is provided for in the user agreement.
As it follows from it, the company has the right to deduct money from remote cards without notifying the client if payment from others does not go through for one reason or another.
The company, commenting on the situation, stated that payments to customers are made with the permission of the clients, and no leakage of bank card data can occur.

A beautiful place, especially in the summer, with gazebos and barbecues around the mammoth sculpture.
There is a small park on the territory where you can take a walk with your family.
Large parking lot.
The store is located on the first floor of the Univer City shopping center.
Working hours are from 10-00 to 22-00.
In the store, you can have a coffee and a snack of freshly baked goods.
There is a small parking lot from the shopping center.
Friendly staff!
Delicious coffee, a wide selection of syrups and alternative milk.
The most delicious fresh baked goods😍😍😍.
Satisfying sandwiches.
Convenient cafeteria area
We came with our daughter to apply for a pension.
They welcomed me warmly, explained everything clearly, scanned the documents, filled out the application, and told me how to make an appointment for subsequent visits.
At the entrance, the administrator and security greet you in a cultured, respectful manner.
The building is decent, everything is equipped for people - there is a hall, a toilet, but it would be nice to buy a water cooler.
We came twice, everything was great!
I wish all workers peace, goodness, luck, and a decent salary, in this difficult time for everyone!!!
Just a great place!
After a long walk on the beach, there is nothing better than sitting by the window with a cup of mulled wine waiting for a salad with scallops (which is simply delicious!!!)
I highly recommend this wonderful place!!!)))
The sweet cashier asked me if I wanted coffee with me or in the hall, 200 or 300 ml.
I asked for 300 ml in the hall.
After a couple of minutes, I am given a plastic cup.
I wanted to do ceramics, so I'm in the studio.
They did something to me.
I ask why in a shot glass, not a cup.
The girl replies that they don't have cups with a capacity of 300 ml.
How does this fit into a person's head?
Ask yourself or in the room, i.e. determine the technology for yourself: pour coffee into a cup or a disposable cup.
To get an answer - in the hall, i.e. in a cup.
Please specify the volume.
Hearing that 300 ml.
To confront a person with the fact that there are no cups of this size.
Here's a paper cup, 300 ml.
It is noteworthy that this is the third such case in Green Okolets in my memory.
It's doubly noteworthy that I wasn't offered a standard cup so I could pour the contents of the plastic cup into it and drink the coffee the way I want. I asked for it myself.
A number of questions arise.
1. Are the Green Okolitsa Cafeteria and the Green Okolitsa organizations that are part of the same coin or are they not connected in any way?
If not connected, understanding appears.
If they are related, why has a food and trade enterprise known in the city for its service and quality sunk to the level of rhetoric of a kiosk at Kazansky railway station?
Rhetoric because, I repeat, this is the third time this has happened to me.
I don't rule out that this is happening not only to me.
2. Does the cashier have instructions?
I got the impression that she is acting on impulse.
I hope I'm wrong.
Please outline the actions for your employees in this case, if you are trying to provide a service.
We really like the circus, we have been going there since we were children.
I saw the numbers with Yuri Nikulin himself.
And now even with children, nephews.
I like the atmosphere in the circus, and the programs too.
The location of the places is very convenient.
The arena can be seen from almost any point, and the backs of those sitting in front of you do not interfere.
The circus is very intimate, family-oriented!
This time we went to the New Year's program.
We were a little disappointed.
Lots of clowns and acrobats.
I would like a room with tricks and more animals.
It's a shame that you can't take photos with animals in the foyer anymore.
But apparently there are reasons for this.
And overall, a very pleasant place!!
I wish you prosperity and to please us with your numbers!!!
I liked the developer Otdestroy, they choose good places to build residential complexes.
They use high-quality materials, which fully justifies the price.
Before buying, we were invited to see the complex when there were not even walls yet, so that we could see everything live, although we looked at apartments for a long time and not a single developer offered us this.
Russia's favorite ski resort!
The most fun is the gentle, not dense forests, especially when there is a lot of soft snow.
But the tracks are boring and short, in my opinion.
The longest on sector e, there are still more or less.
But overall, it has a great atmosphere, lots of different cafes and bars, so a fun skiing vibe is guaranteed!
Great master Peri!
I did everything as quickly and efficiently as possible, the salon is clean and pleasant.
Good service, friendly staff, there is a cloakroom and water.
Horrible service.
The second time I come to pick up my order at the time indicated in the application and wait at the window for more than 30 minutes for my order.
Today, such a service is unacceptable in business!
The response from the "care" service is that we are trying.
At the cash register, even without an apology, just - we're not to blame, it's the program.
You didn't find any other technical possibilities to communicate with your regular loyal customers.
"Trying" is for impotents, and business should work.
Thank you all, we are leaving.
We will not order from you again and will not recommend you to others.
A bad mood, waiting for guests, apologies from the hostess - not the best sauce for hot rolls.
I ordered a car (Jeep Wrangler Sahara) through an organization.
I expected to receive the car in 3-3.5 months (as was agreed), but it actually took 4.5 months - the delay was caused by the situation on the border between Lithuania and Belarus (Lithuania was complying).
In the end, I am very satisfied with the car, thanks to the guys - Dmitry, Stas, Alexander - always available, up-to-date information, professional advice, and a normal human attitude.
Thank you again!
We rented a house for 4 days for 3 people.
The cabins are clean, cozy, and warm (even very), the cabin has its own small kitchen with coffee, tea, sugar, spices, sunflower oil, and all necessary utensils.
There is a cleaning agent and a sponge available.
Among the drawbacks, one could single out the fact that there is not enough space, and the shower in the bathroom is tiny.
There are no designated places for storing snowboards or skis, and there is no place to dry clothes, so we had to borrow a dryer from the hosts and cram it in instead of a chair, and put a heater under it.
But overall, it's a pretty good option in a quiet place.
Stylish, clean, spacious.
The food is delicious, and the selection of dishes is sufficient to meet the needs of any guest.
Prices are reasonable.
There is wine and beer for those who want to drink.
I recommend the center of Moscow
A wonderful place with very polite staff, we will definitely come again.
The property has all necessary amenities, including parking and billiards.
Rooms with good repair and all amenities.
A beautiful and aesthetic place, we walked around during our visit to Kaliningrad.
I really enjoyed it, and Russia in miniature, and Ozerov park and landscape.
In winter, there are many natural hills for children)
A very cool tobacco and hookah shop)
We always shop here, prices are low, and quality is great!
Very responsive staff, will help and answer all questions)
I highly recommend this store for everyone to visit! ❤️
Location is convenient for everyone.
For me personally, it's normal.
They serve quickly, if any of the visitors are not stupid.
It's convenient to make an appointment.
The staff is attentive, they will give you advice, direct you, and consult with you even if you come on days when they are not open.
It's basically okay.
Great guys!
Thank you so much!
Everything was done quickly and efficiently, and the prices are reasonable compared to other services.
I thought the remote control was for ejecting, but they are all so clever and did it for me.
A huge thank you to the young guys!
I ordered a bouquet of 21 tulips with delivery in 2 hours on March 8.
They brought the flowers in a package after 6 hours, as if they had been stolen (there are barely enough papers to wrap the flowers).
Then, when the flowers were already in the vase, I realized that something was wrong.
I compared it with the photo on the website and the color turned out to be completely different from what I ordered.
I decided to count them and found that there were an even number of 20 tulips.
Support in WhatsApp responded to my complaints about the color and number of colors with "apparently they mixed up the color".
The next day I wrote again and I was offered to reimburse 15%.
I think this is the ultimate degree of audacity and most likely falls under the definition of fraud.
I have already sent a request to the tax office about the fact that they refused to issue a check to me.
Next in line are Rospotrebnadzor and the court.
I would not recommend anyone to get involved with this organization.
For more than 10 years, I have been going to the master Samir for hair coloring and haircuts.
I want to cancel the Professionalism of the master Samira, she does her job perfectly, I am always satisfied with her work.
She always listens carefully to the client's wishes, and the client is always satisfied with the result.
I highly recommend this master to all my family and friends.
All of her work is always done at the highest level!!!
A huge thank you to Master Samira 😍
I have been to this gaming club and I can say that the prices are great, there are a lot of gaming computers, and there is also food and drinks.
Among the cons, some keyboards are broken, the buttons fly off, and if we take the “usual gameplay” into account, the computers are not very powerful :(
Therefore, a rating of 4🥸
This place has become our family tradition)
The son goes to his group, and the mother goes to fitboxing in the evening.
The administrators are super-attentive, the coaches are professional.
They organize themed holidays for children, keep the gym clean and maintain the equipment.
It's nice to walk and exercise.
A 6-year-old child already hits well, strong OVP.
Recommended for children, moms and dads)
The best masters!
Irina is just gold!!
The work is done qualitatively, caringly, and everything is clarified.
You can always chat with girls about something!
The third time was !
I will not regret it for anything!
Finally, I can grow my hair after lightening it!!!
And Vita is also studying color theory.
That's why it will soon be able to combine blonde with keratin!
And your hair will say THANK YOU🥰🥰
The master receptionist Elena Polyanskaya is a very responsive master, who explained everything that is included in the regular maintenance in a clear manner.
She also provided all kinds of assistance during the repair of my car.
And also thanks to the master Valery Ushakov for his attentive and professional work.
He was ready to answer any question.
The work was done qualitatively.
The only thing that confused me when booking a service was the insufficiently correct information on the work regulations, but when I showed up for the service, the regulations were more clearly explained.
I want to express my deep gratitude to the staff of the Administration.
A very rare certificate from the guardianship authorities was needed to approve a real estate transaction, and the staff were very friendly and helped me obtain this certificate, even though they could have refused, as it is not part of their duties.
Thank you very much!
Very kind people work here.
Wonderful, kind, polite staff, I'm glad I came to this hairdresser!👍
Master Nahida did an impeccable highlighting, haircut, took into account and understood all my wishes, I definitely recommend her to everyone ❤️
I really enjoyed the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin.
It has been restored for the 800th anniversary, and the interior is stylish and clean.
There are also cafes and toilets for tourists.
I went on an excursion, that was also great.
And I definitely recommend the Russian collection of the Nizhny Novgorod Art Museum - an unexpectedly beautiful collection
I have known Olya for more than 3 years, and we use their services regularly.
During this time, we have seen Olya develop in her beloved profession, constantly learning new things and expanding the space for four-legged creatures, which only inspires admiration and trust.
We always leave our pets with a peaceful mind.
Daily video reports, if necessary, will be taken/taken away by a taxi for animals.
And they will also bring clean and tasty)
It's a fairytale 🥰
Thank you for your care and personal attention to our pets 🐕💜
The Sytny Los restaurant is located near the Medvedkovo metro station.
The restaurant is very cozy!
They prepare delicious dishes.
The menu is diverse.
It is advisable to book seats in advance, especially on Fridays!
A lovely well-maintained zoo.
Less Moscow, but just as interesting and convenient.
We went on a weekday - adult admission was 300₽, schoolchild 170.
There were few people, we took a walk, looked at the animals.
The ant-eater impressed me)
In Moscow, by the way, he was not seen.
There are a couple of cafes with reasonable prices, the toilet is clean and free, and we also saw a phone charging station.
Overall, I recommend it 👍
A salon at the highest level!!!
I am very satisfied with the services of the cosmetologist Kuznetsova Natalia, I only go to her.
I do various facial cleansings - both hardware and mechanical.
100% satisfied.
A master of his craft👍
She tells me all about the characteristics of my skin, and has chosen skincare products that are perfect for my skin type.
I am now happy and beautiful!!!
Thank you, Natalia!!!
A great club with a huge space, a swimming pool, a sauna, a hammam and excellent coaches!
Among the cons is the huge number of pensioners in the pool and in the changing room area.
It feels like they come to the club as if it were a public bathhouse!
Special emphasis on the women's department.
On weekdays, starting at 19:00, there are a lot of people!
I give it a three, and that's only because of the first visit, when I went to the consultant, if I'm not mistaken, Timur, but I could be wrong.
I processed everything quickly, explained everything +/-, everything was clear, my son also decided to get a card, and unfortunately, the consultants were busy with their own affairs, customers were waiting, a consultant approached my son in the end, who knew everything down to the last detail, he looked into the negotiation room several times, discussing something amusing, in the end, my son left without having done anything, the consultant said, well, if you don't want to, then don't, as I was present at this meeting, I was surprised.
A new office, in a new format, everything is comfortable and this attitude.
It's a shame that the first impression was ruined, now we visit another branch, and there the attitude towards customers does not depend on the change of staff.
The selection is very large, the quality is good (the fabric is resistant to the appearance of bobbins), the staff knows their range, they help with the choice of styles.
You can dress both a slim person and a child with an unconventional figure and height.
They are located near the metro, and there is even a small parking lot.
We recommend it!
I was there in September, celebrating my birthday.
In principle, I liked everything about the service and the quality of the food: the prices are low, the portions are medium-sized, so you can eat enough, or you can order again.
The only complaint is about table reservations.
When I ordered, I entered the number and everything else required, after which the bot immediately called to check the phone.
There is nothing else.
When I arrived at the restaurant itself, it turned out that the table was not booked.
We were lucky that there were free places and we managed to get a room.
But, in fact, it is a very good restaurant with an excellent price/quality ratio.
I recommend it!
I went for a cleaning last weekend.
For the first time, I see such an organized staff, who treated many of my questions with the utmost care, and suggested how and what to do for further dental treatment.
I wholeheartedly recommend it, the only clinic where they don't want to make money off of me that I can remember.
A good shopping center.
Everything is there!
A wide range of products.
Diversity of stores.
You can always find a product to your liking.
From food products to gifts.
I will never set foot in this store again.
We bought a washing machine, they said that we live outside the city, so we will deliver it ourselves.
The manager in the warehouse told me where to drive to the warehouse, and when asked if they would load it, he said yes. ))
The item was taken out of the warehouse without a box, and when asked why, they said that's how everything is loaded.
When I started to insist, they put two strips of foam plastic in, like it will do!
They refused to load it into the trailer, saying it's not their job, load it yourself, they have delivery )))
When I said that I would refuse the order altogether, they said, "OK, if you want, it doesn't matter to us." In the end, one of them still managed to get down from the ramp and help his father load the car into the trailer.
I am encountering such rude service for the first time.
A good shopping center, very clean. There is a wide selection of shops and cafes with restaurants.
There is a cinema "Kosmik" and an entertainment center for children "Nevidalia".
On the lower floor there is a large hypermarket "Lenta".
Convenient, large parking lot, convenient location.
A good supermarket for cosmetics, underwear and home goods.
A wide range of products, reasonable prices, polite, attentive staff.
Consultants will definitely help with the selection, provide advice.
Everyone will find something they need.
A good place to spend an evening.
The staff is very good, a pleasant establishment.
I recommend that everyone never make a mistake in their choice. The best establishment in Krasnodar, where you can relax and everything will be super.
I recommend visiting)
We express our gratitude to Marina Chasovaya, who was our agent for organizing the funeral.
When she came to us on call, she took on the task of resolving all issues related to this difficult and sad event, helped us choose everything we needed, was always in touch and informed us about how things were going.
Thanks to her, we were able to send a loved one off in a dignified manner.
Everything was arranged, clearly organized, as we discussed at the first meeting.
Marina, who perfectly understood the state of our loved ones, gave advice on how to make things better and simply sympathized with us.
He is a very good specialist in his field.
Thank you for everything.
Lured by the many good reviews, I contacted RemStirMash and was assigned a master named Alexander.
He started the conversation by saying that he is completely free the next day and ready to serve.
Everyone discussed it and set a time - 14.00.
The next day came - a call in the morning from the master and a statement that he would not be able to come, a difficult request (what is it like? and where is the "completely free?"), and, if he can, he will come after 18.00 instead of the appointed 14.00.
We agreed to meet again the next day.
15 minutes before the appointed time, another master calls and says that instead of Alexander, someone else can come, but in 2 hours.
What kind of tricks are these?
A day and a half of empty waiting, all planned tasks aside!
In short, a skilled master named Ivan came, fixed the problem, for which he is thanked.
So don't be fooled by empty promises and don't waste your time.
The evening observations did not live up to expectations at all.
First there was a small lecture with incomprehensible material, then we looked through a telescope.
Everything was not very organized, children would watch several times, adults would crowd and not be able to let others watch.
The objects we looked at through the telescope were the size of a regular star, and you can look at them for free without a telescope.
The girl answered the questions not very clearly, not realizing that ordinary people do not know many nuances.
It is not clear what the 600r is for.
An amazing place, one of the oldest Mexican restaurants in the city, has been around since the early 2000s.
Cozy atmosphere, always friendly service.
The price is average.
Sit down, eat 2-3 dishes for two (portions are very large) + a cocktail, about 2500 rubles👌
There are interesting beer cocktails, based on beer and tequila, for example, Macho Borracho, I highly recommend trying.
Price 420 r for 0.5 l.
And in general, the restaurant has very tasty food, I don't know about others, but I really liked it, I will definitely recommend my friends to go there)
Great store, I have been buying products from them for quite some time, since the opening.
Good quality products.
I bought a mixer five years ago, and it still works perfectly and is in good condition.
Therefore, when we did a major renovation in the apartment, we bought everything we needed here.
Excellent service!!!
It is very conveniently located, it is both in the center and in the region, in general, it is convenient)!
The gas quality is good, I fill up twice a week for more than 2 years, there are no problems, the price is great!!!
The chicks are on the map and for cash, they don't cheat on the liter.
The store is great!
You can choose any model, at a democratic price, and for any purpose!
The staff is always ready to help with the selection.
I took my daughter's laptop for studying, because her laptop was covered.
They helped, found the right one, gave a guarantee (a month) Thank you! 👍
The sommelier is working.
He helped me choose the wine, because it's hard to figure out on your own with such a large menu.
Working with sommeliers is an interesting and charming experience, Vasily, there are not enough of them in Moscow.
I ate pike perch - it was magical, chef respect.
The children's menu is the same as everywhere: macaroni, fries, chicken nuggets. We ate pizza, it's AMAZING here!
Adults liked the truffle, and children liked the sausage and mushrooms.
My husband ate smoked ribs - it's a bomb, soft, juicy, aromatic.
The staff is good, everyone is smiling and friendly.
We liked it.
The brand new WB order pickup point is conveniently located.
Working hours are from 10.00 to 21.00, without weekends and holidays.
There are fitting rooms inside the PVZ.
A very good place.
Here, you will find real professionals who are always ready to help.
There is also a group and a chat in WhatsApp for informative communication.
Fast delivery.
It's great that you can immediately see and try on the product.
It's great that it's near the house.
Excellent, modern hotel.
The room is spacious, very clean and cozy.
Everything stated in the description is available.
Breakfast is included in the price, a wide selection of dishes for every taste.
Convenient entrance, its own parking lot near the entrance.
Firm 5.
A wonderful puppet theater.
We often go to different performances.
Today we were at the performance of "The Frog Princess".
At the moment, this is the best of the children's shows.
It was very interesting, lots of puppets, special effects.
Even my 14-year-old son went just for company, but he said it was a very good show.
We went on vacation with my husband for 10 days in January 2023.
The vacation was a success on a "5", I liked everything!
I will start in order:
On the day of arrival, they called us, asked what time to expect us, gave us information about the cost of the transfer (1400 from the airport), we ordered a taxi (at 23:00 the price was 850r), we arrived quickly, there were no traffic jams, they let us through the barrier without any problems.
The administrative building is nearby, we processed it quickly, in 15-20 minutes.
All buildings have an elevator, which is a big plus!
The two-bedroom suite is spacious, with warm floors in both the bedroom and bathroom (without heating), a huge balcony with rattan furniture (a table and two chairs), and panoramic windows (in building 5).
The furniture in the room is normal, there is a dressing table with a large mirror, the fridge is not too small, and there is even a freezer.
There are a lot of green plants in the 5th building.
Everything is clean, they change towels and linen according to your wishes, but if you don't ask for a change, they still change them on the 4th day, the linen is of good quality.
The territory is well-maintained, there are benches everywhere, clean paths, and beautiful lighting in the evening.
A minibus takes you to the beach and back every 30 minutes.
5 min. to the nearest public transport stop.
In the dining hall, friendly guys will always wish you a good day.
The food is decent, but everyone comes here for something different, we were all very satisfied, and the choice and quality were always there, there was always fish, chicken, and meatballs, or something like that, vegetables as a side dish every day, their own delicious baked goods, more than four drinks, coffee made from beans, pancakes are always baked for breakfast, it's just that the cheese and sausage are not very good.
The medical staff is very friendly and loyal.
We were also lucky with the weather, there was no rain, the temperature was 11-16°C, and the sun was shining.
We liked everything, we really relaxed.
I want to come again, and specifically in January, when there are few tourists).
It's a shame that the swimming pool and the gym complex will not be put into operation.
Thank you to the entire team of the sanatorium for their coordinated and high-quality work!
We have been going to "Polyot" since August.
Doche turned 4 in September.
She really likes everything, the coach praises her) that's the most important thing.
Let's go to Valeria Nikolaevna Pleshkova!)
I could never have imagined that my daughter is so flexible!
Wandering the streets of St. Petersburg, my friends and I decided to check out this promising establishment - and we were not disappointed!
The prices are very affordable, and the incredibly tasty pizza is eaten in an instant, not even a crumb is left.
A pleasant atmosphere and charming staff, in short, I recommend it :)
It just so happened that I ended up in the Tomarovsk hospital with high blood pressure and a rapid heartbeat.
I was extremely surprised: cleanliness, order, wet cleaning twice, moreover, the windowsills, furniture, and doors are wiped down.
The food is dietetic, but excellent!!!
I was surprised that at 7 a.m. they brought tea with a sandwich (bread, butter, cheese), so to speak, a pre-breakfast.
The medical staff is attentive, they give both intramuscular and intravenous injections!!!
While the drip is still in place, they will come in, ask about your health...
I have had an ultrasound of my heart before, but this is the first time (unfortunately, I don't know the name of the doctor, a young man).
Special thanks to the treating physician Vetokhina Klavdiya Fedorovna!
A true professional: attentive, knowledgeable, gives a comprehensive answer to any question; she selected the dosage and medications, which normalized both blood pressure and heart rate, something she could not achieve after seeing other doctors.
A huge thank you to the chief physician, Mevsh Oleg Vladimirovna, who organized the smooth work of the hospital!!!
Thank you to the medical staff, the nurses, and the cooks!
When visiting the customer service, the impression was good.
In the hall, I met the administrator.
Knowledgeable and polite specialists quickly and patiently help clients with all their questions.
The specialist assisted in filing the application and provided clarification on my question.
For a small store, it's a pretty good selection of products.
There are semi-finished products, milk, vegetables, household chemicals, various small items.
It operates 24 hours a day, which is very convenient, and the staff is always friendly
It's great when there is a place in the city where you can go skiing.
The chairlift is of course busy on weekends, with a 40-second descent and a 5-10 minute wait.
But overall, it's great, immersing yourself in the atmosphere of positivity and winter, even if the roads are muddy and damp.
I went to the service center for iPhone 11 pro repair.
The rear window was broken and the battery needed to be replaced.
I contacted the master Alexander directly, who explained all the intricacies of the repair and immediately specified the price range.
Thank you for the repair, everything was done well.
The masters are very pleasant to talk to, they will show you everything and tell you everything.
However, when replacing parts, the camera was damaged, and the focus was lost.
I immediately reported the problem and received a quick response.
The error was corrected as soon as possible, and everything is working properly.
This service has good specialists with whom it is pleasant to conduct a dialogue.
Prices, compared to other services, are reasonable and affordable.
If repairs are needed again, I will definitely contact you!
Grandiose, beautiful, atmospheric.
But, like most historical sites, it requires close, prompt, and high-quality attention from restorers.
Therefore, 4 and most of these stars are dedicated to the creators, not the maintainers
Great movie
Responsive concierges, garbage is cleaned up, the territory is clean and beautiful, close to bus stops, schools, and stores.
20 minutes to the metro on public transport
A good, cozy place for recreation has opened in our area.
There are all the necessary shops.
A killer and diverse food court in terms of food.
The tables are located in cozy areas.
There is no boredom.
Well, we visited, we tried...
The interior has nothing in common with an Italian cozy cafe...
There is very little space, the tables are rectangular, like in a dining hall.
Pizza... well, who hasn't tried something tastier, so I found it a bit bland.
I didn't like the fact that the waiter is always standing behind your back and almost always looks your companion in the face.
We were uncomfortable.
Connolly, yes, they are tasty.
We will not come here again and will not recommend it to our friends.
Lena Grosskopf is the best hairdresser I have ever been to.
She does everything very carefully and qualitatively, I go to her with pleasure, I understand that everything will be done perfectly.
I also only take my daughter to Lena.
The salon atmosphere is amazing.
Thank you so much!
We broke down on the way from Nizhny, but the kind people from KatResource quickly responded and helped!
Respect to you and prosperity, there should be more such good people!
And the server is clean and good there!
We came to Sergei Chigrakov's concert.
A great concert venue, wonderful sound and atmosphere.
We will definitely come to the planned concerts this year.
A peaceful place, a wonderful Georgian restaurant, live music is played on weekends and holidays!
The staff is pleasant and responsive!
There is a children's room.
Wonderful Georgian cuisine!
The rating is the highest, I adore this place ❤
The park is located in the city center, and it is very easy to get there.
The park is clean, and there is space for both children and adults.
But there has been no sand on the children's playground for a long time, only dust remains.
There is also a fenced football pitch, which, unfortunately, is not very well maintained.
But there are more advantages in our park.
A spacious hall, clean, clear layout of goods.
There are products that can only be bought at the Crossroads.
The staff is friendly.
I didn't get any bad products.
Often there are promotions and discounts.
It's nice that it's close to home.
You can always find a parking spot.
We went to the bar twice, everything was great, polite staff, tasty dishes and most importantly - great music, the DJs know their stuff.
The only thing that disappoints is the soloist of the group "Rukhi Vverkh Band" for the second time.
Not only does he sing softly, but he also reads the lyrics of most songs from his phone, especially when it was songs by the group "Ruki Vverh".
It's kind of illogical (performing at the Bar Up, in the group Up Band).
We went on vacation in early March.
A good hotel, nice rooms.
In honor of his birthday, they gave him a room with a view of the Kremlin.
Room cleaning every day.
Replenishment of water, tea, coffee, shampoo and change of towels.
Breakfast is just a waste of time.
There is a mini bar with crazy prices.
If you want to order room service from a restaurant, you will have to pay a 20% service charge on top.
The prices in the restaurant are slightly inflated.
Tastes like three plus.
The water park was included in the cost of accommodation.
The aqua park itself cannot be called the best in Russia.
But the masseur was just a bomb.
Everything is fine, but the departure was a bit disappointing: neither goodbye nor good luck.
The employee at the entrance didn't even help open the door when he saw women with a lot of bags and suitcases.
We need to work on this to keep the brand.
A great place to gather with friends to take a steam bath.
A large and comfortable sauna, billiards, an open-air swimming pool, karaoke.
The food is delicious, the drinks are fresh)
The workshop is at a high level!
In a short time, I have already repaired 3 pairs of shoes (2 men and 1 woman).
Everything is fine.
The quality of work at height.
Special thanks to the master for his careful attitude and quality of work!
A great basketball school!
My son has been going for 5 months and he loves it, he looks forward to every training session.
Individual approach to children, interesting activities, warm and friendly atmosphere.
The store is great, the staff is friendly, I order online myself.
The store is in a great location.
Plus there are always discounts and promotions, which is also good
A good car shop - convenient location, large hall, good range.
Special thanks to the staff for their responsiveness!
There is a cafeteria with several tables.
I often go there - everything is fine!
Nice pool!
I'm specifically talking about "Little Frog", our coach Anastasia Vitalyevna really likes the child and is professional!!
The changing rooms are clean, the water is warm, and there are hairdryers!
I love the bakery's cookies, service, croissants, breakfasts, and coffee are always top-notch.
But alas, not this time, I ordered coffee and a couple of croissants, the girls at the cash register never made the coffee, until I reminded them, they made it, it's impossible to drink, it smells and there is a aftertaste of spoiled milk, I decided not to finish it and just left.
Last time there was a long black hair in my coffee, they replaced it.
Please be more careful, I am a guest returning here, even after such incidents.
Fabulous eyebrows are here!
Victoria does an excellent job of adjusting, taking into account all the proportions of the face individually.
Wax correction, which effectively removes all the fluff, and the eyebrows look neat for a long time.
The color is chosen based on hair and skin type, which is why the color lasts for a long time.
Don't make better eyebrows!
Thank you so much for organizing my mother's move!
Moving is always a huge stress, but with your company everything went very smoothly, quickly, and efficiently.
Special thanks to Vadim and Roman!
I will recommend your company to all my friends!
Everything is at the highest level.
We have been going to Novodent for dental treatment for the whole family for a long time.
Recently, I had my 8-year-old son's teeth treated, and everything went perfectly. The child is calm and ready to come back again.
You don't have to wait long, there are no queues because appointments are made in advance.
In my opinion, the most delicious shawarma in Tambov is only here, I am not a fan of shawarma, BUT when you want something naughty, only here and only here.
Tasty, fresh meat with lots of fillings.
And I just don't understand why, but it never flows for me.
Often when you finish eating shawarma, you don't eat it anymore because there's a lot of sauce and water, in short, fuuuu...., but not here.
That's why you guys are the best🙂
Good teaching staff.
In the dining hall, they always serve fresh food.
Interesting lessons in the school museum, various events are held throughout the school year
Nice store, polite staff, good selection.
However, the big minus is that the goods that are brought in are apparently destroyed right in the store.
Sometimes there is not enough space to walk between the rows, and it is also not very pleasant when the goods are placed directly on the floor, without pallets, but this is more of a comment on the organization, rather than on a specific store.
A delightful example of Soviet architecture.
Strict grandeur, which is carefully maintained.
I had a double pleasure from the concert, largely due to the atmosphere of the cultural center.
While we were waiting in the lobby, I definitely felt like I was coming to an event, that this was really a night out.
I was looking for a clutch set for my MB Sprinter.
I completely randomly stumbled upon this online auto parts store.
I called, entered the voucher code, and they said to wait)
After 10 minutes, they called back and offered several options.
Since the car is a personal work vehicle, he didn't want to save money and asked to order a good set of LUK clutches.
Another 5 minutes later, they called back and said that there was good news for you.
If you take not the whole basket + disk + straw, but take the LUK basket + disk set and the separate LUK straw separator, it will be cheaper by 2 thousand rubles, which could not please.
After taking off the clutch, I went to the service center.
When removing the gearbox, it was discovered that a flywheel was also needed, and the faster the better.
I already knew where to go), the manager understood the situation and ordered without prepayment by phone (the first time he also paid upon receipt).
The next day the flywheel was in his hands.
The car is quite happy with the new flywheel and clutch, and I am happy that everything came quickly, that they went to meet me.
I will definitely recommend and contact vinkod.shop
The New Year's party was a success, but with some nuances.
I booked a table for two, but they seated me at a table for four.
But no worries.
It's just strange that they didn't warn us.
The kitchen for four, the fish didn't work out at all.
A presenter with contests made at the school level is not very good, to be honest.
BUT everything is perfect when it comes to music.
The atmosphere was great.
Everything else seems like nitpicking.
Thank you for the event
I am leaving my review, with words of gratitude to all the staff of the maternity hospital number 7 in Chelyabinsk.
This institution is staffed only by people who know and love their work, doctors and nurses from God.
Both in the OBGYN department and in the maternity ward, and in the postpartum ward.
But I want to express special gratitude to Kotlyarova E.Y., the head of the maternity ward on the 5th floor, and Yarantseva N.V., the midwife in the maternity ward, thank you so much for your help at the birth of my daughter, for your kind heart, for your enormous professionalism.
A wonderful store.
A wide range of balls, always fast order processing and delivery.
Professional staff.
Very beautiful bouquets, always left with great taste, always fresh flowers.
We visited the establishment on the recommendation.
The food is amazing, the programs are nonexistent, the waiters are a bit cheeky, but we were in a great mood with the kids and celebrating an important event, so we were friendly.
There was no fire delivery plateau, the children waited.
You can safely go for good food.
