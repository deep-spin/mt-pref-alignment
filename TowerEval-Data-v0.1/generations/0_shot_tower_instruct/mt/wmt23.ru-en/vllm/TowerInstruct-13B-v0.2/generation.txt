The July issue is traditionally submitted during the Moscow Film Festival, and this is, of course, very sad: to read the pages when your heart is set on Chabrol.
However, we will talk about the MMKF next time (for now, I will only complain that this year the organizers finally became convinced of the inexplicable idea that happy owners of purchased tickets are more important for the festival than accredited guests, a ridiculous and quite insulting principle that no normal film festival in the world is guilty of), but in this issue we report on what we saw in Cannes and at Kinotavr.
The cover of the July issue is adorned by yet another pleasant face - the title character of the Robert Rodriguez film "Predators", and inside the magazine, try not to miss the story about "Inception" by Christopher Nolan (the man, by the way, who rebooted "Batman..."), the most - without any foolishness - anticipated film of the summer.
And this time we are publishing the first part of a fairly detailed guide to the works of Alfred Hitchcock, and here it is absolutely clear that the author of "Suspicion" and "The Rope" is our Tatiana Alekseeva, Boris Gleizerov, Anna Golovnya, Nick De Semlin, Dan Joling, Tamara Dondurey, Nikolai Karayev, Denis Korsakov, Maria Kuvshinova, Ivan Kulikov, Will Lawrence, Sergey Mesenov, Sergey Natapov, Ian Nathan, Kim Newman, Zaira Ozova, Neve Pierce, Alexey Prostakov, Seraphima Skibyuk, Adam Smith, Moor Soboleva, Vasily Stepanov, Alexander Strelkov, Ollie Richards, Oleg Tishchenkov, Alena Logunova, Chris Hewett, Olga Shakina, London-based Evelyn Salt, despite her brilliant track record, was suspected of espionage in favor of the Russians and decided to be caught at any cost.
Cornered, it will turn black, as we know it, and go off to find the truth on its own.
The latest action movie with Angelina Jolie in the role of a fatal babe promises to further cement the actress's position in the action genre.
She will cause one accident after another, run along walls like in The Matrix and knock over burly men in the same strict suits like a child.
That is how beauty should save the world.
Here he is, the native, who blew up and fixed the world with "The Fifth Element" and made Milla Jovovich the most beautiful woman in the universe.
Bruce Willis was the most superhero guy, and Gary Oldman was the most stylish and flawless embodiment of Evil.
And, at the same time, it all turned out to be not a tedious American-style blockbuster about saving humanity, but a charming, lively carnival.
I don't want to recall what Besson did for 13 years between "The Fifth Element" and "Lucy".
He, to put it mildly, did not sit idle, but all this screenwriting and production fuss and rare, forced directorial appearances will be forgotten.
But "Adele..." - hardly.
When you watch this movie, it seems like the 13 years before us was not our Besson, but some kind of doppelganger.
And he himself, the real one, lived in a small apartment in Montmartre, drank wine in the cafe across the street and wrote a story about the most charming adventurer.
In this case, it is more of a sin than usual to retell the plot (even in general terms), whetting expectations.
The incredible drive here is that there are surprises around every corner or line of dialogue.
And they are all pleasant.
Either a girl, or a vision
The unusual adventures of Adel
The most daring adventure movie of the decade hints that "The Extraordinary Adventures of Adele" will start like "Amelie," veer off into "Jurassic Park," continue with "Indiana Jones" and "The Mummy," and end with "Titanic."
The film is based on the first volume of Jacques Tardi's comic books about journalist Adèle Blanc-Sec.
Louise Bourgoin, before Adèle, only appeared in three films.
The actress became famous for her role in "The Girl from Monaco", for which she was nominated for a Cesar award.
The director does not run after the viewer with his hand out, begging to appreciate the special effects, sets or stunts, but instead draws them in, like an old-fashioned novelist, exclaiming before a great journey to the center of the earth or to the end of the world: "Come on, my reader, great things await us!"
At the same time, Besson treats genre films, about which everyone knows everything, with a reckless and cheerful attitude, like a boy who has watched too many old films and read too much Jules Verne.
Manipulating banality, not denying oneself cynicism and not being afraid of risk
DIRECTOR Luc Besson
IN ROLES: Louise Bourgoin, Mathieu Amalric, Frederic Bel, Gilles Lellouche
SYNOPSIS: Strange things were happening in Paris in 1912.
The city was stirred up by an ancient monster, which the old medium brought to life.
The police are chasing the prehistoric creature, as well as a famous hunter, a couple of scientists from the Museum of Natural History, and journalist Adele Blanc-Sec, who has a case not so much with the beast itself, but with a medium - she needs to save her sister.
For the same purpose, the girl is dragging a real mummy from Egypt.
OUT JULY 22
"Adele..." is a case where parody becomes the pinnacle of the genre itself and is capable of radically changing it, directing it down a new path.
This was the case with Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, with Quentin Tarantino's gangster movies, with the aforementioned Indiana Jones (they both paid tribute to it and made fun of it), and finally, with the same Fifth Element.
Besson's style in this film is made up of verbal trickery, actor clowning and plot acrobatics (circus terms are entirely appropriate - the union of the two arts is organic and strong as ever).
A few words should be said about Adele herself.
It embodied the undeservedly forgotten type of adventuress, who takes not so much by exploiting sexuality, but by pure courage and bravery.
In movies, such girls are usually paired with some sort of macho or romantic guy
TEXT: ALEXANDER STRELKOV
Face to face with history
There is only a timid and comical admirer, who only circles around her feet (his knowledge of zoology proves to be useful).
Therefore, the energetic girl does not waste time on love nonsense, but instead has fun in the company of ancient corpses, which, by the way, play a key role in the plot.
Trained on numerous genre "cats" and seemingly completely spoiled, Luc Besson showed unexpected creative daring, reminding that the border between the preferences of bored visitors to mega-malls and highbrow regulars of arthouse cinemas is easily overcome by films for cheerful lunatics.
Playing an adventure movie without sadness, fear or reproach
ROOM OF DEATH
A hermetic horror with claims to psychological depth and political context, in 2002 Jonathan Liebesman's debut horror film was torn apart by critics, but was well-received by the public and did well at the box office, and most importantly, caught the eye of producer Michael Bay.
That's how the young director ended up at a factory that churns out new horrors according to old patterns: Bay set himself the goal of re-filming the entire horror classic in the form of remakes and commissioned Libesman to make a prequel to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2006).
The critics again scowled, but the public liked it again - Libesman worked in the spirit of the "new horrors", who emphasize the excessive physiological nature of violence.
In general, we can observe how an entire genre is convulsing in its death throes, trying to invent new ways of influencing a jaded audience: the naturalistic gore of the splatterers merges with the slasher chase scenes.
The plot is reminiscent of the Saw franchise, but without the gallons of blood.
Among the prototypes is the debut film by Vincenzo Natali, "Cube", which was made by Michael Bay.
So in the "Death Room" Libesman had to take a different path: instead of the brutal slaughter or the monotonous running from the maniac, he chose a smarter option - almost without the infamous bloodshed, but with psychological games and riddles.
Evil doctors here play a cat-and-mouse game with the test subjects.
And three men in a locked room are trying to work out a survival strategy: team up or shoot each other?
Play by the rules and obey orders from outside?
Or try to break out of your cage at any cost?
They are not the only ones being tested, but also a young ambitious employee of the special services, who is being tested for ruthlessness by an experienced professor who is well-versed in wild experiments.
SYNOPSIS: For $250, four volunteers sign up for a simple test.
They are put in an isolated room and given a stack of sheets with meaningless questions.
Then a polite man in a white coat enters the room, introduces himself as a doctor and shoots one of the subjects in the head.
A game of survival begins, which government agents watch closely from behind the glass.
Too pensive for a horror movie, but not enough for explicit art house
He can hold a conversation with a lady, and even hit someone in the face with a fire extinguisher, but he can't let a single skirt pass by.
On the contrary, charming Nastya is cautious and unyielding in her sympathies.
She is offended by her father's gallant way of life and openly spies on him as he, as if parodying the famous scene from Paul Verhoeven's Showgirls, dives into the pool after another romantic victim.
The daughter rebels, and the father tempts her young beau from a poor family with money.
But the main theme of the family conflict is not a difference in generations or a choice of profession, which, one way or another, is already predetermined, but the girl's unsuccessful attempts to refute the obvious idea that in modern Moscow everything is bought and sold.
Mger Mkrtchyan, who directed a sluggish melodramatic film, teamed up with Pavel Bardin to make the comedy "Three and the Snowflake" with Ivan Urgant.
Depardieu convincingly portrayed the father of a growing up daughter in a comedy genre
The fragmentary plot revolves around the love affairs of the characters, who are always discussing psychology, and who, apparently, by a clever directorial idea, focus on the language of the glance and gesture.
The secondary plot lines (a girl who was crippled in a car accident, whom Aleksey wants to marry, and an alcoholic athlete played by Sergei Gorobchenko) are, alas, only sketched out.
It is especially a pity that the line about the business of buying up football players was left out of the final cut.
PLOT: More than anything else in the world, the agent who sells football stars is concerned about the fate of his underage daughter Nastya.
The kind-hearted dad changes his women like expensive shirts, but his daughter is about to turn eighteen, and she absolutely must marry a guy with a "spine".
What a disappointment for the businessman when Nastya, in the struggle for independence and in defiance of her father, chooses his peer and business partner.
But the author hit the nail on the head with the potential slogan for the film's audience: "Don't look for a problem where there isn't one." You couldn't put it more accurately.
Their resemblance is simply amazing.
In both films, there are squads of tough guys, soldiers of fortune, forced to take revenge on those who betrayed them, and there is one beautiful girl in each company.
The heroes jump around almost the same parts of the world (both films start in Latin America and end in the port of Los Angeles) and exploit the same spectacular shots - something stuffed with dollar bills explodes there and there, and a whirlwind of bills descends on the set.
Even the villains, dressed in expensive costumes, are not easy to distinguish from each other (they are both played by Patricks - Jason Patrick here, Patrick Wilson there).
Zoë Saldana's previous role was Neytiri in Avatar.
Sylvain White used to make dance battle films - "Step Up".
Chris Evans was recently called to play the hero of another comic book: he will be Captain America.
Director Sylvain White was inspired by a series of comics that came out in the 70s and was relaunched in the 2000s, Joe Carnahan - a comedy series of the 80s.
It's just amazing how they, without colluding, brought different material to an absolutely identical thunderous signifier, making rather heavy, predictable, unnecessary action movies, which bring to mind a lot of pictures with Willis and Schwarzenegger (comparisons invariably turn out in favor of Bruce and Arnold).
If you have to choose between these two films, then Losers looks a little more appealing and is clearly more successful in terms of ROI (the budget is three and a half times smaller).
At least there's Zoey Saldana, who looks great with bazookas
STARRING: Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Zoë Saldana, Chris Evans, Patrick Wilson, Idris Elba, Columbus Short
SYNOPSIS: During an operation in the Bolivian jungle, a group of seasoned commandos working for the CIA were set up by their own superiors: the helicopter with the children they were trying to rescue was blown up, and the soldiers themselves have been considered dead since that second.
But they are alive - and they are determined to take revenge on the villain with the sinister voice who arranged all of this.
All of this is nice, but honestly, spending an hour and a half of your life on a White movie is only worth it if you have absolutely no other options.
Made from recycled materials, the conditionally edible bowie knife
A simple story about a fugitive Romanian convict
A Romanian low-budget film that won a prize at a prestigious international film festival.
In principle, with only these data in hand, one can vividly imagine the hypothetical content of the painting, and even some specific details of the form.
Without a doubt, the film promises to be socially relevant.
Of course, it will be realistic, and tough.
There is a high probability of the participation of non-professional actors.
There will also be a lot of Romanian poverty in the film (yes, poverty knows no nationality, but Romanian poverty, as our festival laureates prove from film to film, is especially poor).
Also, without knowing the year of release, one can easily mistake what is happening on the screen for the exercises of some underground critical realists from the Warsaw Pact countries, who were lectured about Bresson in the early 80s
The film received the Grand Prix of the Jury at the Berlin IFF.
The screenplay is based on a play by Andrea Valentin, whose work is in particularly high demand among directors of the Romanian "new wave".
Operator Marius Panduru often works with Corneliu Porumboiu.
All of the above is true for the debut work of Florin Serban, and - understand us correctly - is not at all pejorative, but rather recommendatory in nature: Romanian "new wave" is in that blissful stage of development when its representatives believe in the methods
their work has not yet been shaken.
And this moment must be captured: it is only thanks to this faith that one can endure the hour and a half spectacle of the Romanian colony for minors and surrender to the charisma of the talented Pistereanu (whose story, despite the chasm separating two cultures, can be easily understood.
convert it into a 70s-style exploitation movie, with a cowboy who decides to take a walk from jail, where he'll be out soon, to the nearest saloon).
IN ROLES: Georg Pistereanu, Ada Condesa, Mihai Constantinescu, Clara Voda, Marian Bratu
SYNOPSIS: Having served his four years, 18-year-old inmate Silviu (Pistereanu) is about to be released, but suddenly finds out that his mother wants to take his younger brother with her to Italy.
From this moment on, the young man's behavior becomes inadequate.
The affair with social worker Anna further encourages the guy to commit desperate acts, the meaning of which is summed up in the title of the film.
What a load of rubbish!
If you want to watch, watch.
Not a bad debut, inspiring a faint hope that a decent movement will one day emerge from the Romanian art house
A cartoon about the joys of villainy and family life
The directorial debut of a man named Grob (Sop) and his co-author Reno was made under the auspices of producer Christopher Meledandri, the grey cardinal of American animation, responsible, in particular, for all the Ice Ages, Horton and Robots.
"Ugly Me" is probably the best work of his team: the picture is beautifully drawn (by the way, it's worth watching in 3D), especially if you like when different objects keep trying to jump out of the screen and into the hall), it's written decently, and, most importantly, there isn't a single low-brow joke, because of which you had to shamefully press yourself into the chair and cover your child's ears during "Ice Ages".
It is clear that the reason for the change of course was not the authors' sense of proportion, but the blatant asexuality of the main character, which in turn is dictated by a reluctance to touch on the topic of pedophilia in any way.
The “adult” part here, in addition to the main conflict of single fatherhood, is provided by some pretty harsh black humor (which, one would like to think, we owe to director Coffin).
Overall, it's a very nice film - so much so that at one point it seems almost too perfect and correct.
You can feel the hard work of a well-coordinated team of marketers who thought through every little detail to make the film appealing to all categories of citizens.
Not that we want to see the heroes of a children's cartoon eaten by cannibals or destroyed by an atomic explosion
PLOT: The snouted villain Gru, whose childhood dreams of space travel have over the years transformed into the idea of stealing the moon, in order to carry out his grand plan and eliminate a young competitor, is forced to resort to the help of children.
In some advanced shelter, he adopts three orphan girls - Margo in glasses, Edith in a hat, and Agnes, who is as adorable as the cat from Shrek.
As is usually the case, the children immediately changed the plans of the adults.
The main character is based on Christopher Melandri - both of them are bald, have big noses and are prone to black humor.
In the original, the main characters were voiced by Steve Carell and Jason Segel.
In the finale, Gru dances Travolta's part
A car pulls up to an abandoned trailer somewhere in the middle of a desert, and three pairs of well-built chicks get out.
That's right.
The bearers of this gift are not so essential in themselves.
The camera confidently focuses attention on this part of the body.
For connoisseurs, we have good news right away: the entire film is in the same spirit.
Rick Jacobson understands the right things about female beauty and he cast the film in such a way that what is happening on the screen is of secondary importance.
And a lot of funny things happen.
The "broker", "killer" and "stripper" dig in the sand, get doused with water (don't ask why), carry some sort of foul-smelling substance and periodically engage in brutal fights.
The creators think that a mooing cow with generous curves, smeared in mud, with a broken nose and teeth shining with whiteness is cool.
"Stervoznye shchuki" are primarily focused on classic sexploitation films.
Rick Jacobson directed episodes of Xena: Warrior Princess and Hercules: The Legendary Journeys.
A film with a similar spirit is currently showing in Moscow: "A Gun for Jennifer".
It's also cool when a bitchy beauty twists a bandit's balls, a battered punk fights with a Japanese schoolgirl, a samurai sword and lesbian sex are involved; and the intrigue is developed through an endless number of flashbacks.
In general, for a cinema fetishist, a real Klondike of pleasures is discovered here.
It is clear, of course, that Jacobson and his gang had a great time making this trashy parody, but the task itself seems rather strange.
If it weren't for the physical data of the actresses, it would have become boring by the middle.
One can assume that this fowl came to us from the adult night channel (Jacobson, by the way, often takes on serial episodes)
IN ROLES: Julia Whelan, Erin Cummings, America Olivo, Michael Hirst, Ron Melendez
PLOT: Three dangerous beauties bring the mafia boss to the desert, where diamonds worth a substantial amount are hidden somewhere.
Having achieved nothing and having shot the unfortunate bandit, the women start to scratch, fight with each other and the periodically arriving scumbags from somewhere, as well as regularly kiss and cuddle.
As the case progresses, it turns out that all three are not who they claimed to be at the beginning.
Apparently, according to the author, it's even funnier that way.
A product for a narrow circle of lovers of monstrous stupidity
Yes, with his latest film, Doomsday, and the watered-down Mad Max for the poor, Marshall has made a serious misstep
A bloody and biting peplum restores the director's shaken confidence.
The new politically incorrect and gloomy magnum opus is not shy about its modest budget, obvious sources of inspiration, and savage B-movie aesthetics.
The film also has the hooligan spirit of "Dogs of War" and the animalistic brutality of "The Drop".
The Marshall Plan to clean up the "populum" from the post-gladiatorial cinematic muck, in general, worked.
In 2011, Kevin Macdonald will present his interpretation of the story of the Ninth Legion.
His battle-scarred legionnaires (among others, the unexpectedly colourful David Morrissey and Liam Cunningham) are tough guys trying to reconcile their military duty with an overwhelming desire to survive.
Murder and the gory details of going to the toilet in ancient times are depicted here with love and detail.
The scene of the extermination of the Ninth Legion, which took up a lot of budget money, is directly inspired by the opening scene in the German forests from the now-standard Gladiator by Sir Ridley Scott, but for some reason, we don't want to accuse Marshall of plagiarism: he works honestly and without complaints.
IN ROLES: Michael Fassbender, Olga Kurylenko, Dominic West, Liam Cunningham, David Morrissey
PLOT: The lands of modern Scotland, occupied by the Holy Roman Empire.
The remote outpost where centurion Quintus Dias (Fassbender) is serving is mercilessly defeated by the Picts' scouting party.
Miraculously saved, Diaz is forced to first join the infamous Ninth Legion, and then, with a group of other surviving Romans, try to slip away from a group of Pictish warriors led by the sadist Etain (Kurilenko).
The subtle art-house actor has so far only managed to win sharply characterised supporting roles in Hollywood, but one really wants to believe that after Centurion the situation will change.
Pepulum is a corrected and supplemented edition.
Almost like Gladiator, only more modest and severe
The continuation of the story about schoolgirl Bella (Kristen Stewart) and her complicated relationship with two extremely promising young people - the pale-faced vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and the werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner).
Pattinson's fans held their breath.
A large-scale cinematic version of the animated series about a bald boy-wizard, who is called upon to bring peace to the four kingdoms.

The young Aang can stop him only if he learns to control all the elements and becomes the Avatar.
Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) can steal other people's thoughts and works tirelessly in the field of industrial espionage.
By penetrating the subject's sleep, it forces the sleeping brain to work according to its own rules.
But this time he will have to do the opposite — leave in one head what was not there.
A masterclass in managing illusory worlds from Christopher Nolan.

With the help of destructive spells, they will create a mess in the middle of Manhattan with dragons and explosions.
Bald as a billiard ball, the cat has hatched a plan to take over the world, and now the super-dog agents must join forces with their meowing adversaries.

A few hardened thugs, led by the frail-looking Royce (Adrien Brody), mysteriously find themselves on another planet, where they are hunted by stylish, fanged aliens.
The return of the cult character of the 80s to the big screen.
Note George Clooney, who teams up with rock photographer-turned-director Anton Corbijn ("Control") for a fascinating existential study of an ageing hitman hiding out from the world in a small Italian town and coming to grips with human nature.
"A visionary artist on the scale of Kubrick and the magnificent George Clooney - this is a cinematic union made in heaven," boasts the studio's press release.
Moreover, this project is another confirmation of Clooney's longest love affair in life - with Italy: the filming took place in the picturesque town of Castel del Monte in Abruzzo.
Taking Martin Booth's novel "The Very Private Gentleman" as a basis, Rowan Joffe made some adjustments to his screenplay: the English narrator was replaced by the American in the title, and the main character, an illegal arms dealer, became a simple murderer.
Otherwise, the story is close to the original: while hitman Jack tries to sort out his last job and finally give up his lucrative trade, his icy heart melts under the charm of the local priest (Paolo Bonacelli) and a street prostitute (Tecla Ruten) whom Clooney's character falls in love with instantly.
"Jack tempts fate," the official synopsis reads.
A dangerous messenger of darkness is getting closer and closer to him, and the mysterious lady who hires him may well turn out to be not who she claims to be."
Judging by the trailer, Cobbain's visual experiments, seasoned with Clooney's ashy hair (the film is like a long 02 clip), have reached a qualitatively new level.
Daniel Radcliffe to play the lead in Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front adaptation
Or maybe I'll shoot you with my air rifle!?
Johnny Depp could be seen in two places at once this season.
Firstly, in Venice, on the set of the thriller "The Tourist" by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck ("The Lives of Others").
There he plays a heroin-addicted tourist in love with Angelina Jolie.
Secondly, in Puerto Rico, on the set of The Rum Diary, the screen adaptation of the debut novel by the legendary Hunter S. Thompson.
The director and screenwriter of the project is Bruce Robinson (“Withnail and I”), whose last directorial work was the thriller “Jennifer 8” in 1992.
Looking at the work of the poster artists of the domestic prison drama, one can even not doubt what inspired them.
But you can’t approach the issue of implementing the idea literally!
However, at least the fact that the heroine of the Russian film is a stranger, but not bald at all, is a good thing.
Director Dennis Dugan mostly specializes in projects with Adam Sandler.
They have already completed four joint projects: "Gilmore's Lucky Man", "Big Daddy", "Chuck and Larry: Fire Wedding", "Don't Mess with Gohan!".
In July, the fifth comedy, "Classmates," comes out, and the sixth, "The Baster," with Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman, is in production.
The schedule also includes a seventh film, the romantic comedy Jack and Jill, in which Sandler will play both Jack and his twin sister Jill.
Matthew Vaughn, who was remembered by the audience this year with the spectacular action movie Kingsman, will be in charge of the X-Men reboot.
For the movie X-Men: First Class, the director first called James McAvoy, giving him the role of the young Professor X.
Rosamund Pike will play the mutant telepath Emma Frost, also known as the White Queen, Amber Heard will transform into the blue-skinned Mystique, and Michael Fassbender will presumably become Magneto.
While filming of the new Bond series is being postponed, its new director Sam Mendes is not getting bored.
On his list of things to do are the musical Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and the screen adaptation of the novel by Iain M. Banks, On the Shore.
The screenplay is being adapted by the author himself.
Carey Mulligan has been offered the main female role.
Gary Oldman takes on the role of practical Major George Smiley - the main character in John Le Carre's series of novels - in the screen adaptation of the thriller Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.
In the first adaptation of this work in 1979, Alec Guinness played.
The new version will be directed by Danish director Thomas Alfredson, the creator of the horror film "Let the Right One In".
Tom Tykwer will adapt David Mitchell's fantasy bestseller "Cloud Atlas".
According to the director, it is not an easy (in the novel there are six parallel storylines), but extremely interesting work.
Offers from him have already been received by Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, James McAvoy, Ian McKellen and Natalie Portman.
In Crimea, filming is underway for Maxim Korostyshevsky's international action movie, which is currently known by the working title "Soldiers of Fortune".
It is dedicated to millionaires who went to a real war in search of adrenaline for their money.
The film stars Christian Slater, Sean Bean, Wing Reams, Dominic Monaghan, Oksana Akinshina and others.
The film's premiere is scheduled for the beginning of 2011.
Sam Rockwell will star in the comedy "Baby Jesus" with English pop star Pixie Lott
Megan Fox was fired from Transformers 3
According to the Ratatouille film company, the dismissal "is not connected with the interview in which Fox compared Michael Bay to Hitler".
However, the place of the main heroine and the new love interest of Shia LaBeouf will most likely be taken by the English model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.
The girl has no experience in cinema, so she will have to take accelerated acting courses.
This fact should not frighten the sophisticated viewer - there are plenty of examples in the history of cinema of successful retraining of models into actresses.
Charlize Theron (“Monster”), Angelina Jolie (“Life Interrupted”), Jessica Lange (“Blue Sky”, “Tutsi”), Kim Basinger (“LA Confidential”), Jennifer Connelly (“A Beautiful Mind”), Gina Davis (“Random Tourist”) and “First Vice-Miss USA-86” Halle Berry (“Monster’s Ball”) started out as models or were photographed for fashion magazines, and eventually received a well-deserved Oscar.
They succeeded in acting (also the beautiful Mila Jovovich, Cameron Diaz, Monica Bellucci and, especially pleasing, our compatriot Olga Kurylenko.
High awards are clearly within their reach.
In short, Rose has someone to look up to.
Valeriya Gay Germanika, who received a Special Mention from the Cannes jury in 2008 for the film "Everybody Will Die, But I Will Remain" and who directed the scandalous television series "School", has been appointed creative director at the MT television channel.
The channel's management believes that it is Valeriya who will be able to bring about the desired and necessary changes.
In particular, they are already planning to shoot their own series (about teenagers or vampires).
Also, Germaniqa began casting new hosts.
The comedy "Kolotilov" by director Levan Gabriadze and producer Timur Bekmambetov unexpectedly turned into "The Escapists".
The main theme of the film remained the same: the provincial Russian language teacher Slava Kolotilov (Konstantin Khabensky) rushes to Moscow to his fiancée, but is delayed to train a football team of street children.
The second storyline of the film has undergone new development.
Instead of actress Elena Plaksina, the role of the capital's bride Nadya will be played by Milla Jovovich.
As an additional intrigue, a third one will appear - Nadia's former fiancé Danya (Ivan Urgant).
So, in addition to the question of whether the street team will win the football championship, there is a dilemma of who will get Milla Jovovich.
Due to the constant delays in the filming of The Hobbit and the presence of a lot of outside projects, Guillermo del Toro gave up the position of director.
Studios are urging producer Peter Jackson to take the reins, but he's only willing to do so if absolutely necessary.
Possible successors include David Yates, who has finished filming the Harry Potter saga, and Neil Blomkamp, whose film "District 9", produced by Jackson, received an Oscar nomination.
The name of the new director will be officially announced at the next Soth-Sop convention at the end of July.
Angelina Jolie to play Cleopatra
Stunned by the tight schedule, critics and filmmakers rushed between the Sochi Winter Theatre, where screenings with master classes were held, and the Zhemchuzhina Hotel, where press conferences and round tables were held, barely having time to dive into the Black Sea.
The heroes of the competition films also behaved in a similar manner - almost everyone was running somewhere: the confused Asians from Yusup Razykov's "Gastarbeiter" and Dmitry Mamuliya's "Another Sky" were looking for a missing grandson and wife, and the escaped gangster from Yuri Bykov's "To Live"
The same thugs were happily led around by the nose by the hero of Klim Shipenko's detective film, Who Am I?, which, however, was remembered by the public more for the presence in the frame of the totally naked Zhanna Friske.
Heroes of the domestic show business appeared in a couple of competitive films - in the film "Slon" Sergey Shnurov played a long-distance truck driver who was taking a circus animal to be slaughtered, and Evgeny Grishkovets mused on his favorite topics - female betrayal, male loneliness, the healing power of alcohol - in the two-person film adaptation "Satisfaction", where business partners challenged each other to an alcohol duel over a woman.
However, the business events at Kinotavr also had a strong showbiz feel to them – there was never a dull moment.
At a round table dedicated to the fate of Russian art house cinema, the chairman of the fund to support domestic cinema, Sergei Tolstikov, got into a heated argument with critics: "Do you read the articles in the press that I read?" he sternly asked those present.
"I write them," the confused answer of the president of the ERVEES! Andrei Plahov.
The scandals did not end there: closer to the end of the festival, the film Ovsyanki by Aleksei Fedorchenko was suddenly removed from the competition program - it will go to Venice: the selectors of Mostra decided that an extra Russian screening would be an obstacle for them.
Previously, the giants did not interfere with Kinotavr - in Sochi, films from major festivals were shown more than once: this time, for example, Sergei Loznitsa's film "My Happy Life" was in the competition, having competed with Mikhalkov and Virasethakun on the Cote d'Azur in the spring.
Nikita Sergeevich visited the film of a former Cannes competitor at Kinotavr and stated that he liked it.
The chairman of the jury, Karen Shakhnazarov, on the other hand, did not like Loznitsa's film at all - but under pressure from his colleagues, he was forced to give her the prize for directing.
The award for best debut - "Missing" - was received by the daughter
A terrifying cinematic encyclopedia of Russian life: the naive, humane and rational hero is beaten, robbed and provoked into committing monstrous acts without any apparent reason.
A precisely aimed, clarifying film experience, made by a misanthropic mathematician, who calls for only one thing - start thinking.
A debutant with a philosophy education, Mamulia calls his films quotations from Mamardashvili, avoids any events in the script and claims that the viewer's joy is in the work of comprehending his inaccessible meditative films.
The most difficult picture of Kinotavr has already been selected for the Karlovy Vary competition - a directorial star has been born.
Impeccably dressed and groomed programmer Leonid reacts to the world with restrained disgust, hiding in the burrow of his neat bachelor lifestyle.
But a cast-iron baba descends on the house, the hero's head is struck by the unjust hand of the punitive authorities, and he begins a senseless run through Kafkaesque spaces and situations.
"Sometimes it's useful to work not only with debutants," triumphantly declared producer Sabina Yeremeyeva from the stage as she accepted the award.
Critics saw it differently: in their opinion, Sabine simply managed to pull an "internal debutant" out of the veteran of domestic art cinema.
And this is symptomatic - nowadays in our cinema the bison follow the young people.
And not the other way around.
A documentary film shot in such a way that it blows your mind more than a similar fictional film.
The author is interested in the screwdriver examining the electric meter, and the piece of unsalted butter drifting across the cast-iron skillet—all of it turns the story about the unemployed miner, his rare-toothed lover, and her criminal brother into a real doc-canvas with oil.
Short film competition winner Nikolai Sokolov applies the black-and-white style of the French New Wave to the world of sleeping districts.
Let the Gorbachov-style montage in the story about two schoolboys, one of whom dreams of making a bomb and the other of playing Bach backwards, seem strange, but thank you for the rare attempt at poeticizing the surrounding reality.
"Three times a year - on the eve of Victory Day, Russia Day and City Day - about ten planes of the An-12, Il-18, An-32, An-24 type take off into the sky, equipped with meteorological equipment and technical means of cloud manipulation during the works, and loaded with special environmentally friendly chemicals - liquid nitrogen, granulated carbon dioxide ("dry ice"), meteorological pyropatrons with silver iodide and powdered reagents.
The process looks like this: planes, 50-100 kilometers from Moscow (depending on the length and intensity of the rain front), “break up” the clouds heading towards the city with these reagents. The particles of the substances condense the moisture around them.
As a result, precipitation falls earlier than planned, and in the very place where the cloud was affected."
For ten years now, work has been underway on a remake of the science fiction film, in which Michael York played the lead role.
Recently, the director was appointed Carl Rinsch (he already has a remake of "Creatures from the Black Lagoon" on his schedule), who is famous for his commercials.
Previously, the project was associated with the names of Bryan Singer (X-Men), James McTeigue (V for Vendetta) and Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy).
According to the plot, the hero, who has turned thirty, is forced to flee from a death sentence, since the society of the future executes all citizens upon reaching this age.
Robert Rodriguez has acquired the rights to the 80s rotoscoped fantasy cartoon and plans to make a big-screen movie out of it.
The original was the result of the joint creative efforts of director Ralph Bakshi (Lord of the Rings, 1976) and fantasy artist Frank Frazetta.
The theme of the cartoon was swords, magic and a lot of drawn tits.
In it, the warrior Larn saves Princess Tiger and the entire nation from the evil ruler of the ice, Nekron.
Rodriguez promises to pay close attention to the creation of non-humans and barbarians on pterodactyls.
George A. Romero will send his zombies on vacation for the time being, as he himself is planning to take on a remake of Dario Argento's classic giallo film.
The big screen will be brought back to life by none other than Michael Bay, the lord of action, explosions and horror remakes.
The director of the remake will be Damin Chen, who will also adapt the script.
Argento and Romero had already collaborated on "Day of the Dead" and together filmed "Two Evil Eyes" in 1990.
This time Dario is not directly involved in the project, but his brother Claudio is producing the film and writing the screenplay.
Jennifer Garner and Nick Nolte to join Russell Brand and Helen Mirren in remake of comedy 'Arthur'
"I wanted to bring more strength to the female character to reflect the state of affairs in China," says Chen.
— Chinese women today run major businesses and win Olympic gold.
Donnie Yen embodies that power."
For the second time in a row you play an imaginary character.
Is this an accident?
A pattern.
I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I am presenting two films here (at Kinotavr and the Sochi film market - EMrb).
And in both I play the dream woman.
But... that's how the director saw me, that's how he presented me, and many people probably think that's how I am in real life.
A girl of dreams.
Your film partner, Alexander Yatsenko, is completely different from his character.
How did you find a common language? What is he like on set?
He is absolutely not what he seems at first glance.
At first I saw him and thought, "Oh... not just me."
Probably, without human contact, sincere and real, we would not have succeeded.
And this contact happened to us literally a few minutes after we met.
We got on really well, I'm not afraid to use that word.
I told him about all my fears, all my worries, that I was afraid I wouldn't make it, and I asked him for some advice and help, and he was happy to give me that advice and help.
We talked a lot...
I tried to do this because I was very afraid of losing this contact, of losing our mutual understanding.
And that is why at the premiere we watched the entire film holding hands.
How did the filming in Sevastopol go?
Sevastopol is the city where I came for the first time.
I have never had a gig there, nor have I ever been there for a vacation or as a child.
This city has a special magic, some kind of character, its own charisma.
And it is a city that you want to return to.
It has its own provincial charm.
A place where no one is in a hurry and everyone always manages to get there.
It seems that it was not difficult for you to play the part of being in love with this city.
In general, you are extremely natural on screen, which many, frankly, did not expect.
How do you work with roles?
Are emotional scenes easy for you?
You know, I'm an amateur actor.
And I am, by nature, a very trusting person.
If I came and agreed to work with the director, then I, in fact, entrust myself to his hands and I want to be a test from which they will mold.
I understand perfectly well that it looks better from the outside, and I, again, ask for hints and talk to the director for a very long time, not I who talk to him, but he who talks to me and conducts preliminary conversations with me and explains very clearly and precisely what he needs.
And then, after long, multi-hour rehearsals, we arrive at the organic nature you speak of.
And how was it working with the director of the film, Klim Shipenko?
I was thrilled by everyone, the cameraman, the director, the producer, Sasha Yatsenko.
Because I love working with crazy people!
I saw the same thing when I worked with Timur Bekmambetov.
He was ready to not sleep, not eat - and here was exactly the same situation.
Not sleeping or eating for 24 hours - and still, no matter what, it's raining or thundering.
And if something didn't work out, it was a catastrophe, and it was urgent to do something to make it work.
It's very easy to work in this atmosphere of madness.
And I think that when people are so obsessed to the point of being sick about what they're doing, it can't not work out, because so much energy is being expended.
What scenarios are you refusing?
What are the criteria for selecting the material you will be working with?
I don't want nonsense, stupid dialogues, films that don't say anything, don't carry anything.
I don't want to work just to appear on the screen once again.
Do you have any proposals, projects that you are going to work on in the near future?
There are no specific proposals or plans at the moment.
I am not the kind of person who draws up schedules.
The script arrived, it interested me, and today the premiere happened.

While we are working on the November issue, film festivals are taking place almost continuously in Moscow: the American film festival, Amfest, 2nd, and the 2-t-1 festival will begin soon, followed by the British film festival.
And here's the interesting thing: half of my acquaintances are constantly discussing who needs to be boycotted and who needs to be supported, for some - well, excuse me - very obscure reasons.
Moreover, when one of these festivals is solemnly closed with a terrifying Chu4 projection without English subtitles, no one seems to notice anything.
You don't want to complain about this, but if you buy a ticket with your own money and then sit in the auditorium watching giant pixels and horizontal figures of actors, then that's what they'll keep showing you.
And in the meantime, we have no pixels: Tron: Legacy (a continuation of the classic film about virtual reality), Let Me In. Saga (an American remake of the excellent Swedish film), Unstoppable (another approach by Tony Scott to the topic of trains), and a wildly detailed account of how the films about Conan, the barbarian, destroyer and governor were created.

The studios aren't stupid, by the way: in order to stretch out the viewers' enjoyment and squeeze the maximum out of the franchise, they decided to split the seventh film into two parts.
So the sentimental farewell to the magical world of Hogwarts will stretch until next summer.
SOCIAL NETWORK
The history of the creation of the Facebook network
David Fincher's new film is, first and foremost, a story about a paradox.
The film tells the story of the invention of Facebook, one of the pioneering tools of the Internet, which united the whole world, broke up five friends and made its creator, 26-year-old former Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, the youngest billionaire of recent decades.
Jesse Eisenberg is as great in the lead as our conflicted genius, an emotionally isolated social outcast with an unpredictable set of motivations and attachments.
Zuckerberg is launching the site for a variety of reasons: partly out of anger at the world, partly out of sporting interest and partly just because it's "cool."
The very idea and its implementation may seem spontaneous and impulsive, but the actual course of events suggests a clear calculation and a well-thought-out business plan.
The strengths of The Social Network become apparent from the first frames, especially in the scene before the opening credits, where Zuckerberg talks in a bar with his ex-girlfriend Erica (Marling): the sharp, tough dialogue by screenwriter Aaron Sorkin gains strength here and does not soften until the very end.
The same goes for Fincher's direction: relatively restrained (except that the Winklevoss twins were played by actors who didn't look alike.
The face of one of them was superimposed onto the other using computer graphics.
Natalie Portman was studying at Harvard at the same time as Zuckerberg.
Rooney Mara was cast in Fincher's next film, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
DIRECTOR David Fincher
STARRING: Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Rooney Mara, Justin Timberlake, Armie Hammer, Joshua Pence
PLOT: The moody and withdrawn Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, having received a turn for the worse on the personal front, takes on the ambitious task of creating a fundamentally new social network.
As Facebook grows more popular, relationships with a few fellow friends begin to sour and eventually lead to lawsuits.
The color palette plays its part: warm, at times sunny, even in the dark it remains cozy, it maneuvers between two tangled chains of events and two separate lawsuits.
Outside of the constant stream of debate, there isn't much that happens in the film: not a single death, not a single murder, and all of Zuckerberg's legal troubles hardly amount to an extra paragraph on his sparse Wikipedia page.
What attracted the 49-year-old Sorkin and the 48-year-old Fincher to this story that is not too generous with details?
After watching it, you get the persistent feeling that The Social Network is a portrait of our time, and that the lack of detail in this case is an important artistic technique.
Just twenty years ago, Wall Street was doing much the same thing, only on a larger scale - with space egos and big deals.
Now that overnight funding rates have gone even higher, the policy is no longer being conducted in boardrooms, but in sandboxes.
Zuckerberg wants to be special, he dreams of being the center of attention.
Seaverin (Garfield) is hurt that his best friend has a new best friend (Timberlake) and now he has no one to play with.
The Winklevosses (Hammer and Pence), meanwhile, are pounding the pavement: Who says rich, beautiful, and athletic can't also be smart?
(This line particularly amuses Fincher.)
If desired, a black comedy could have been made out of The Social Network.
Zuckerberg is obsessed with the idea of popularity and leadership, but what is more in his case - positive or negative?
And what social consequences will its invention entail?
Is he a swindler?
Or a cunning manipulator?
Fincher and Sorkin would never close the book if there was even the slightest hint of something like that.
But it won't even be necessary here: in their version of history, it's not important at all.
"What is it like to feel beautiful?" asks the song "Vabu Wotce A Vsp Map" by Tre VeaNez that precedes the titles.
The hero doesn't know.
The film suggests the answer.
Zuckerberg is a representative of the lost online generation, which has a poor understanding of beauty and even less of feelings.
A tastefully made character drama about a high-profile trial in the internet age
In the early 17th century, when Ivan Susanin lived, surnames had not yet really started to appear among people of humble origins.
They got by with the designation "son of so-and-so".
That is, patronymics - nicknames based on the father's name - were in use.
But sometimes, for example in the case of a father's remarriage, the matronymic - a nickname based on the mother's name - was used.
Susannin is just such a case: "Ivan, Susanna's son".
The serfs of small landowners really did go without surnames for a long time - why would you need one when you have 20 souls and everyone is always in sight.
But the owners of the multi-thousand-acre estates were forced to give their peasants surnames.
So, the serfs of Prince Andrei Cherkassky already had surnames en masse at the beginning of the 18th century.
In the 19th century, even small landowners did not keep the muzhik on the land, but let him out on lease - let him earn a living with his craft and pay the landowner.
Such a peasant was issued a passport, where the surname had to be written down.
Of the serfs in Central Russia, 55% were released on a quit-rent basis when serfdom was abolished.
Which means they already had surnames.
Capital criminalists flew in to investigate the explosion in Novosibirsk
Central office forensic experts and staff from the forensic examination centre have arrived in Novosibirsk to help with the investigation into the gas explosion in a house on Liniya, 39, reports NGS.
According to the investigation, the accused, Irina Urbach and Evgeny Kavun, posing as employees of the fictitious organization "Mezhregiongaz", inspected and repaired gas equipment.
They used low-quality parts, worked carelessly, and, on the contrary, overpriced their services, the agency reports, citing an informed source.
The day before the tragedy on Liniya, the man and woman visited three apartments in house No. 39, where they changed the hoses of the stoves.
For example, in one of the apartments they installed a water hose instead of a gas one.
However, Kaoun denies this.
According to him, this is impossible, everything was certified.
As a result of their actions, there was a gas leak and an explosion of a gas-air mixture in one of the apartments.
Two entrances collapsed - one completely, the other partially.
This led to a significant collapse of the building, which resulted in the deaths of 13 people.
Earlier, suspects were arrested in the case of the explosion in a house in Novosibirsk.
The fraudsters themselves came from Omsk.

The specialists were able to prevent the flood thanks to the dam being closed the day before.
On Friday, the threat of flooding in Saint Petersburg increased dramatically due to the bad weather in the city.
The sea flood was prevented thanks to the timely closure of the dam.
The potential flood could have been the 32nd in a row, reports the St. Petersburg publication Nev.Tuday.
The water level reached 184 centimeters, but thanks to the closing of the floodgates in the Gulf of Finland, the water level was kept at 168 centimeters, which is only seven centimeters above the lower threshold of the dangerous flood level (from 161 to 210 centimeters).
Weather conditions were complicated by gusty winds, the speed of which at times reached 20-25 meters per second.
Now the dam has been opened again, the water level has dropped, and ships can once again sail through the Gulf of Finland.
It should be noted that ten meteorological stations on the eastern side of the Gulf of Finland are monitoring the water level situation.
This will prevent flooding that may follow the strengthening of the wind.
In Turkey, 8 people were arrested in the case of defects in the collapsed buildings
In the Turkish province of Şanlıurfa, 8 people were arrested in connection with the construction defects found in the buildings that collapsed as a result of the earthquake.
As reported by Armenpress, Habertürk reports this.
As a result of the earthquake that occurred in Turkey on February 6, more than 20 thousand people died.
The number of wounded exceeds 80 thousand.
It is noted that the earthquake is the strongest since 1939.
The 7.7-magnitude earthquake was followed by hundreds of aftershocks, which were felt not only in 10 provinces of Turkey, but also in neighboring Syria.
Pashinyan sent congratulatory messages to the Supreme Leader of Iran and the President of the country
Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan sent congratulatory messages to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Seyyed Ali Khamenei, and to the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ebrahim Raisi, on the occasion of the 44th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.
This was reported to Armenpress by the Department of Information and Public Relations of the Office of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia.
The message to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution of Iran, Seyed Ali Khamenei, reads:
Your Eminence,
I warmly congratulate you on the 44th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution.
The Armenian-Iranian warm and friendly relations with centuries-old roots, rich history and traditions are of special importance for our two countries.
More than three decades have passed since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Republic of Armenia and the Islamic Republic of Iran, and we are witnessing sustainable and stable bilateral cooperation.
I am confident that the Armenian-Iranian friendship, which has been forged in an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust, will continue to achieve even greater successes for the benefit of the peoples of Armenia and Iran.
I take this opportunity to wish you good health and many years of life."
In the congratulatory message sent to Ebrahim Raisi, in particular, it says: "Your Excellency, please accept our heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to you and the friendly people of Iran on the occasion of the 44th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution.
Based on centuries-old history and mutual respect, the unbreakable Armenian-Iranian relations are of special importance for the Republic of Armenia.
I am confident that as a result of joint efforts, we will be able to take interstate cooperation to a new level, the multisectoral agenda of which will be even more expanded for the benefit of the well-being of our two friendly peoples and the security of our countries.
Emphasizing the importance of our views on establishing and strengthening regional peace and stability, I confirm the official invitation addressed to you during my visit to Tehran last year to visit Armenia.
I take this opportunity to wish you new achievements, and the friendly people of Iran - a stable peace".

Video caption: WW2 bomb explosion in Great Yarmouth is caught on camera
In Great Yarmouth, a port city in England, an aerial bomb from World War II exploded on Friday, which sappers were trying to disarm.
The powerful explosion was heard dozens of kilometers away, but there were no casualties.
Norfolk Police said that while the explosion was unplanned, no military personnel involved in the bomb disposal were injured.
"The device detonated shortly after the start of the operation to neutralize it.
Fortunately, the entire crew is safe.
The agencies have begun assessing the damage," Norfolk Police Assistant Chief Nick Davison told reporters.
Locals are writing on social media that the explosion shook houses 24 km away.

Caption under the photo: The explosion happened despite the plans of the sappers, but there were no fatalities or injuries
The 250-kilogram bomb was found during construction work on the bank of the River Yar, at the mouth of which, on the shore of the North Sea, Great Yarmouth stands.
Before attempting to defuse the bomb, the sappers built a protective sand wall around it, and a cordon, inside which no outsiders were allowed, was set up 200 meters away.
Bomb disposal experts initially, back on Thursday, were going to use a robot to cut the detonator off the bomb, but the attempt failed, and then they decided, according to local press, to use the technique of "slow burning" of the explosives.
It was during this burning process that the explosion occurred.
During the Second World War, the Nazis dropped hundreds of thousands of bombs on Britain.
During the eight-month intensive bombing campaign from the autumn of 1940 to the spring of 1941, known as the "Blitz", 450 thousand bombs were dropped on Britain.
Women account for almost 40% of Belarusian researchers
In Belarus, the number of women among researchers is 38.9%, reported to Belta the scientific employee of the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences Alesia Solovei.
The proportion of women among candidates of sciences and doctors of sciences is also growing: among candidates of sciences women account for 41.1%, among doctors of sciences - 21%.
In all fields of science, except for technical ones, the proportion of women exceeded 50%.
The most feminized field of scientific knowledge is medical sciences, where the share of women is 64.4%.
Only in technical sciences do men predominate, women make up 26.7%.
In the National Academy of Sciences, the proportion of women among researchers is 49.1% - this is more than in the republic as a whole, by 10.2%.
Among candidates of sciences, the proportion of women is 46%, among doctors of sciences - 20%.
More than half of the teaching staff in higher education institutions are women (57%).
Among the pro-rectors for scientific, educational and educational work, every third is a woman (31.8%), among the deans - 38.7%, deputy deans - 44.6%, heads of departments - 42.5%.
Women are most prevalent among senior lecturers and lecturers - over 60%.
There is also a high percentage of women among associate professors in the departments (55.2%).
According to the republican monitoring of public opinion conducted by the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences last year, the majority of Belarusians do not support gender stereotypes about women's opportunities in science.
63.5% (56.5% of men and 69% of women) do not agree with the gender stereotype that "science is a male sphere of activity."
More than half of the country does not hold the opinion that a woman is less competent as a scientist - 66.1% (59% of men and 71.6% of women).
"The transformation of gender stereotypes in the mass consciousness about women's research competence contributes to attracting young women to science, developing their creative potential, and forming a successful role model of a female scientist, including through the transfer of experience and the institution of mentoring," noted Alesia Solovei.
February 11 is annually celebrated as the International Day of Women and Girls in Science.
The holiday was established to involve women and girls in the field of science, to encourage women to pursue scientific careers, and to recognize the achievements of women in science.
According to UNESCO, women make up 30% of the total number of researchers in the world. -0-
The probability of a further increase in the key rate is higher than its decrease
This statement was made by the Chairperson of the Bank of Russia, Elvira Nabiullina, following the results of the meeting of its Board of Directors on 10 February, which decided to keep the rate at 7.50%.
The head of the regulator, in particular, noted that important changes have occurred recently.
On the one hand, the conditions of foreign trade have noticeably deteriorated - the prices of Russian oil have fallen.
On the other hand, the economic situation is developing better than the October forecast.
The shift in the structure of demand continues: consumption remains restrained, private investment is slowing down, but budgetary expenditures are growing.
At the same time, overall pro-inflationary risks have increased.
"Therefore, this year the likelihood of a rate hike exceeds the likelihood of a rate cut.
The expediency of changing the rate will be determined by the development of the situation," said E. Nabiullina.
In addition to the more pronounced impact of fiscal policy, she noted three risks.
Firstly, a rapid increase in consumption in the context of heightened inflationary expectations, if the factors that are holding back consumer activity weaken.
Secondly, there is an increasing shortage of workers and a lag in the growth of productivity behind the growth of wages.
And there are still risks of additional tightening of sanctions.
Speaking about the regulator's future decisions, the Chairperson of the Bank of Russia noted that, despite the earlier noted strengthening of pro-inflationary factors, the inflation forecast for the current year remains at 5-7%.
According to her, this may require a higher trajectory for the key rate than was assumed in October.
In the updated forecast of the Central Bank for this and next year, the ranges for the average key rate have been increased by half a percentage point, to 7.0-9.0% per annum for 2023 and 6.5-7.5% per annum for 2024.
"This does not rule out the possibility of a rate cut this year, but its likelihood and magnitude have diminished.
On the contrary, the likelihood has increased that some rate hikes may be needed in order for inflation to reach the target of around 4% in 2024," concluded the head of the Bank of Russia.
The Bank of Russia has approved the requirements for the procedure for creating special closed-end investment funds (PEFs) consisting of blocked foreign securities.
The regulator informs that such securities will be removed from the list of existing retail mutual funds.
This will allow the management of the remaining liquid assets and the resumption of operations with investment shares.
If a retail mutual fund has more than 10% of locked-in securities, the management company must allocate them to a separate closed-end mutual fund by September 1, 2023.
Each shareholder will be issued shares of the new fund in a quantity equal to the shares of the main fund.
It is also possible to change the status of the retail fund to a closed one.
For funds with a share of blocked securities of less than 10%, the new requirements are not mandatory.
But the management company has the right to allocate the blocked assets into a separate closed mutual fund.
In addition, a requirement is introduced to inform shareholders about the consequences of withdrawing blocked securities into a special mutual fund.
In the future, if such securities are sold, the management companies are obliged to pay investment shareholders at least 90% of the funds received on a quarterly basis, the Bank of Russia said in a statement.
In addition to summarizing the industry, experts also gave a forecast for the current year.
According to data from Promsvyazbank’s Analytical and Expertise Centre, in 2022, passenger turnover in air transport in Russia decreased by 6.3%, and passenger transportation by 14.2%.
The volume of passenger transportation amounted to 95.2 million people, and the passenger turnover amounted to 228.0 billion passenger-kilometers.
International passenger traffic amounted to 17.2 million people, which is 26.7% lower than the previous year, while domestic traffic amounted to 78.0 million people (-10.9%).
PSB analysts note that the industry's relative stability was influenced by the state support program.
In 2022, a domestic tourism stimulation program was in effect, which was allocated 38.8 billion rubles.
Tourists could receive a partial refund for tours with flights prepared by Rostourism.
In addition, several state support programs were implemented to ensure the accessibility of air transportation, including subsidies for the transportation of citizens, the development of regional transportation, etc., with a total budget of more than 27.5 billion roubles.
In the second quarter of 2022, the government decided to allocate an additional 100 billion roubles to airlines and to recapitalise Aeroflot with 52.5 billion roubles.
"Despite the sanctions pressure on the Russian aviation industry, as a result of the development of domestic tourism and the opening of new international destinations, as well as the continuation of state subsidies for the industry (25.3 billion roubles have been allocated so far), in 2023, passenger traffic, according to our estimates, will increase by 6.4%, to 101.2 million people (domestic passenger traffic will amount to 91.1 million people), according to the forecast of Rosaviatsia, up to 103.0 million people," PSB analysts share their forecasts.
Terrorist attack in Jerusalem, 6-year-old child killed
Two people, including a 6-year-old child, were the victims of a terrorist attack in Jerusalem: a car crashed into a bus stop at high speed.
Another six people were injured.
The driver of the car was shot dead on the spot.
It later emerged that the attacker was a 31-year-old Palestinian from East Jerusalem.
Law enforcement agencies classified his actions as a terrorist attack, the terrorist's relatives were detained, and the house was sealed.
At the same time, according to Israeli media reports, the attacker had mental health problems, and he was only released from the hospital this week.
Austria is once again tightening controls on its border with Hungary following another influx of migrants in recent months.
Officials say many people are staying in their cars at the border waiting to cross into Austria.
This is thus a signal to the Austrian authorities that they have already gone through the asylum procedure in Hungary.
Based on existing agreements, Austria believes that migrants are obliged to remain in the country where the request was filed.
At the same time, the Austrian authorities do not consider it correct to automatically send back to Hungary those who want to cross the border: many migrants fall victim to smugglers and find themselves between two border posts without the right to return to Hungary.
This is why, according to the police, increased control is required.
The decision to tighten checks by Vienna followed a pledge by European Union leaders to provide more funds for cameras, drones and guard towers to secure the bloc's borders.
According to the Frontex agency, last year the number of illegal migrants who arrived in the EU and requested refugee status exceeded the 2016 figures for the first time and amounted to more than 330 thousand.
The cargo "Progress 83" successfully docked with the ISS
The Progress 83 automatic resupply ship successfully docked with the International Space Station on Saturday at 3:45 a.m. Greenwich time, completing a two-day orbital flight.
The docking occurred at an altitude of 269 statute miles over the southern part of the Pacific Ocean.
The docking was broadcast by the NASA Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas.
In Russia, the docking was monitored by specialists from the Flight Control Center.
The cargo ship was greeted by the cosmonauts Sergei Prokopiev, Dmitry Petelin and Anna Kikina from the ISS.
The Progress MS-22 spacecraft delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS, including 720 kg of refueling fuel, 420 kg of water, as well as about 1,354 kg of dry cargo.
In addition, the ship delivered food for Russian cosmonauts.
Progress 83 successfully launched from the Russian Baikonur Cosmodrome on Thursday.
At the same time, Roscosmos reported a depressurization of the Progress MS-21, which was prepared for undocking from the ISS and further sinking on February 18.
As the company's press service specified, the ship's hatch was immediately closed: "Progress MS-21" was isolated from the ISS's general volume.
The reasons for its depressurization are being established."
The TsUP also reported that the ISS crew is not in any danger: "The temperature and pressure on board the station are normal.
The lives and health of the crew are not in danger, they are feeling well."
"There have been more cases of maternity tourism".
How pregnant Russians got stuck in Argentina
The Argentinean Migration Service has begun to suspend and cancel the residence permits of Russians who received them through the birth of a child, but did not remain to live in the country.
Earlier, the republic's authorities denied entry to several pregnant Russian women who were suspected of arriving with the purpose of "maternity tourism".
On February 11, they were still allowed into Argentina by court decision.
Read more in the material from Gazeta.Ru.
The Argentinean Migration Service has begun to suspend and cancel the residence permits of Russians who received them through the birth of a child, but did not remain to live in the country.
The director of the service, Florencia Carignano, spoke about this to the C5N television channel.
"What we are doing is suspending the residency of those Russians who came to get residency because their child is Argentine, but who have spent more time outside (Argentina) than inside (the country)," she explained.
According to her, when the issue of Argentine citizenship for the Russian will be considered in court, the migration service will submit data that the residence permit was suspended because this person "spent a month in Argentina and never came back".
Carignano warned that the Russians who received a residence permit after the birth of a child and left, may have it revoked.
Against this backdrop, on 9 February it became known that three pregnant Russian women were "stuck" in an airport in Argentina due to being denied entry into the country.
According to the head of the consular department of the Russian embassy in Argentina, Georgy Polina, the diplomatic mission links the incident with the fact that the authorities of the republic could consider the information provided by the girls upon entry to be incomplete or false.
One of them arrived on February 7, two more arrived in the evening of February 8, RIA Novosti reports.
The diplomat emphasized that more pregnant women flew to Argentina, but it was these three who were issued a prescription not to enter the country.
"They were not allowed into the country in accordance with the migration law, where one of the grounds for denying entry is the provision of incomplete, false, or distorted information," said Polin.
On Saturday, February 11, the Argentinean migration service, by court decision, allowed pregnant Russian citizens into the country, reported lawyer Christian Rubilar.
"An hour ago they were all allowed to enter Argentina," TASS quotes him as saying.
Rubilar noted that the migration service changed its decision after the court ruling.
It is easier for foreign parents of a child born in Argentina to obtain a passport of the republic.
It allows for short-term travel to 171 countries without visas, including EU states, Great Britain and Japan, RBC notes.
In early January 2023, The Guardian wrote about a "boom in maternity tourism" to Argentina among Russians.
According to Polina, between 2,000 and 2,500 Russian citizens moved to the republic in 2022.
Many of them, the diplomat noted, are Russian women who are going there to give birth.
"In 2023, this number may grow to 10 thousand", he said.
In turn, Carignano previously stated that in 2022, around 10.5 thousand Russian citizens arrived in Argentina, and over the past few months, more than 5.8 thousand pregnant women.
On February 9, it became known how rental prices for housing in St. Petersburg have changed.
It has fallen in price by 10%.
It is also known that rental prices have increased by 25% across the country, reports Patrol Petersburg, citing RBC.
The average monthly rent for an apartment in St. Petersburg at the beginning of 2023 was 27,000 rubles.
A one-room apartment cost 25,000 rubles a month, a studio apartment - 22,000 rubles a month, a two-room apartment - 36,000 rubles a month.
Experts believe that this trend may change by the spring, when many citizens who have been abroad will return home.
The reasons for the interrogation of women in a foreign country have become known.
The Argentinean Migration Service did not let six pregnant Russian women into the country, as the purpose of their visit, which they had indicated, turned out to be false.
TASS reports this with reference to the Todo Noticias television channel.
For five hours, pregnant women were asked about the purpose of their visit.
Most of them admitted that they had come to a foreign country to give birth.
In connection with this, representatives of the country did not let the Russian women into Argentina.
As the publication specifies, the migration service has a procedure of action if there are suspicions of "false" travelers.
For example, if it is obvious that a woman is in her 33rd week of pregnancy, she has no return ticket to Russia, and she cannot clearly explain where she is going to go on holiday, then she immediately comes under suspicion from the migration service.
Moreover, experts clarify that it is difficult to be a traveler "under such conditions".
The artist's decision to leave the theatre was planned.
The recipient of the State Prize of the Russian Federation, Alexander Filippenko, stated that the decision of the Moscow City Council Theatre not to renew his contract was planned, and, moreover, everything was agreed upon in advance with the management.
He spoke about this in an interview with the Interfax agency.
In the productions in which he took part, he invited artists from the second cast.
The People’s Artist of the Russian Federation clarified that his contract ended in 2022.
All the details were agreed with the theatre representatives a long time ago.
Moreover, everyone knew that the star was not going to renew the contract.
Filippenko noted that the management agreed and prepared all the necessary documents.
So, he assures that he "did not let anyone down".
In addition, it became known that the artist emigrated from Russia.
He flew to his heiress in Latvia.
Filippenko is going to undergo "long-term treatment" in a foreign country.
As the publication says, at the moment the film actor works in the Moscow theatre as a guest actor.
According to the publication, the artist played in the Moscow Council in such plays as "Shakespearehamlet" and "The Taming of the Shrew", "Uncle Vanya", as well as "Three Sisters".
On Friday, February 10, 340 thousand cubic meters of snow were removed from private sector territories in Kalininsky District.
This information was shared by the city hall.
At the moment, there are more than four hundred private sector streets in Kalininsky District that need to be cleared of snow by the spring.
The roads will be cleaned in two stages.
The first will end on February 15, and the second will take place from March 1 to April 15.
114 pieces of special equipment and 123 workers will take part in the cleanup.
Officials said contractors are facing snow removal on the roadway by residents of the homes.
Kirkorov won a lawsuit against a fisherman
In the lawsuit, the man claimed that the artist's construction was illegal, but he did not show up for the hearing.
The fisherman sued the musician Philip Kirkorov over an allegedly illegally installed pier at his dacha in the Moscow region.
This is reported by the Fifth Channel.
However, the Saratov fisherman did not win the case.
The Odintsovo City Court considered the complaint against the singer. According to the lawyer, the court was presented with documents and design projects that confirmed the legality of all structures installed on the territory of the celebrity's home.
As the head of the law firm, Alexander Drobrivinsky, clarifies, the construction of the pier left the plaintiff no chance of going fishing.
The application for the performer was submitted on January 11.
The star lawyer joked that the man probably planned to fish exclusively from the artist's home.
Ironically, Dobrovinsky clarified that he would ask Kirkorov to provide the plaintiff with his balcony for fishing.
He emphasized that from that spot it is possible to cast a spinning rod further.
A sleep specialist named the causes of sleep problems
Sleep specialist Sofia Cherkasova spoke about foods and habits that interfere with healthy sleep.
As the specialist noted, sleep problems often arise due to products containing caffeine.
This primarily concerns tea, coffee, chocolate and any cocoa-containing desserts.
Their use before bedtime should be limited, since they not only interfere with falling asleep, but also make sleep "fractured", which means that it does not allow the body to fully recover.
According to the doctor, it is best to stop consuming caffeinated products 6-8 hours before bedtime.
Otherwise, they contribute to a decrease in the excitability threshold of the nervous system and, as a result, difficulties with falling asleep occur.
Alcohol also negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
The doctor clarifies that small doses of alcoholic beverages contribute to relaxation and do not affect sleep.
However, amounts exceeding 36 grams when converted to pure alcohol lead to various sleep disturbances, such as shallow sleep and frequent nighttime awakenings.
In addition, to prevent problems with falling asleep, the sleep specialist recommends giving up spicy food in large portions.
Large volumes and spicy food contribute to an increase in internal body temperature, which negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
For healthy sleep, it is not only necessary to maintain the external temperature regime: the optimal air temperature is 18-20 degrees - but also the absence of an elevated body temperature.
According to Cherkasova, it is not worth overindulging in heavy foods before bed, as it will not allow the body to fully recover and rest: it will be forced to spend energy on digestion.
The doctor also reminded that the lack of healthy sleep and accumulated sleep deprivation affect the quality of life and usual activities, so it is extremely important to adhere to a sleep and rest schedule and allow the body to recover.
Bloomberg named Trump's competitor in the upcoming presidential elections: In the world: Politics: INFOX.ru
According to the agency, the main competitor of the former president in the upcoming elections will be Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.
Republican Desantis has not yet officially announced his intention to run for the presidency, but Bloomberg sources report that he is already preparing for the primaries.
According to the agency, Desantis’ team is already selecting consultants to participate in the presidential elections and is conducting preliminary polls.
In confirmation of this, Bloomberg reports on a planned off-site meeting for Republican Party leaders and government representatives at the end of February.
The agency reports that the Florida governor's team is seeking support among Republican colleagues from Iowa, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and other states. Bloomberg experts named DeSantis the main potential competitor to Donald Trump.
Experts believe that the current governor of Florida is well-known enough that he does not need to start a campaign right now, and also note his ability to raise money.
Ron DeSantis was a supporter of Donald Trump's candidacy for the presidency in 2017, and he may run against him in the presidential election in November 2024.
Donald Trump has officially announced his intention to run for president "to make America great again"... during a speech to his supporters in Florida.
The current president, Joe Biden, despite the assurances of his team about his intention to participate in the 60th presidential election, stated that there is no firm decision on this matter.
Hundreds of demonstrations against pension reform will take place in France on Saturday
France's unions are holding a fourth day of mass protests against pension reform on Saturday.
Hundreds of demonstrations will take place across the country, French media report.
After a slight decrease in the number of protesters on Tuesday compared to the first two "days of mobilization," the trade unions hope to bring more protesters onto the streets this time, taking into account those citizens who were unable to participate in the demonstrations during the week.
Law enforcement agencies expect between 600 thousand and 800 thousand protesters across the country, including between 90 thousand and 120 thousand in Paris, the media writes.
On February 7, 757 thousand people took part in the protests against the pension reform, according to the French Ministry of the Interior.
The largest trade union association, the General Confederation of Labour (CGT), announced 2 million demonstrators.
According to the CGT, 400 thousand demonstrators took to the streets of Paris on Tuesday.
Police say there were 57,000 of them.
On the previous day of protests, on January 31, the number of protesters was 1.27 million, according to police estimates, and 2.8 million, according to trade unions.
The next mass protests are planned for February 16.
As reported, on January 10, French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne presented the government's draft pension reform, which provides for an increase in the retirement age from 62 to 64 years.
It is expected that the established age limit for retirement will gradually shift from 62 to 64 years of age over a period of three months per year, and this process will continue until 2030.
The new regime will apply to French generations born in September 1961 or later.
During the 2022 election campaign, French President Emmanuel Macron declared his determination to carry out pension reform before the end of his second presidential term.
On February 6, the French National Assembly began considering the government’s draft pension reform.

ASTANA.KAZINFORM - The capital's police department urges drivers to be extremely careful on the roads, to take into account the impact of weather conditions, the reduced visibility during precipitation, and the change in the adhesion properties of the road surface in icy conditions.
Over the past 24 hours, 181 accidents were recorded.
Kazinform reports this with reference to the press service of the police department of the city of Astana.
Pedestrians should also be careful on the road, since their violation of the rules of crossing the roadway also often leads to serious consequences.
This year, there were 11 cases of vehicles hitting pedestrians who crossed the roadway in violation of established requirements, and all 11 pedestrians suffered bodily harm.

The depressurization of the "Progress MS-21" occurred on the ISS: February 12, 2023, 00:12
TASS - KAZINFORM - Roscosmos reported a depressurization of the Progress MS-21, which was prepared for undocking from the ISS, reports the MIA "Kazinform" with reference to TASS.
"The hull of the Progress MS-21 transport cargo spacecraft, which is scheduled to be deorbited on February 18, has been depressurized, according to telemetry data received at the Mission Control Center," the Roscosmos press service reported.
As noted, at the moment it is isolated from the general volume of the station.
The causes of the incident are being investigated, and it did not affect the docking of the Progress MS-22 cargo ship or the further flight program of the ISS.
The situation was commented on by the Executive Director of Roscosmos for manned space programs, Sergei Krikalev.
"A coolant leak occurred in the thermal control system of the cargo ship, which has been docked at the station for several months.
The situation is somewhat similar to what happened to us with the ship (Soyuz MS-22 - TASS note) in mid-December," he said, noting that the commission that analysed the incident with Soyuz came to the conclusion that the leak was caused by a micrometeoroid.
Roscosmos will conduct an analysis to ensure that there are no problems during the next launches.
"We need to do a deep analysis to make sure that this cause is not carried over to similar configurations on future launches.
That is the main task that will now be facing us," he said.
According to the executive director, an analysis will be conducted from the perspective of the ship's readiness for launch, the materials that were used, and the technologies that were used in assembling the radiator.
The same analysis was carried out in the case of the damaged radiator of the Soyuz MS-22 spacecraft.
"The most important thing is to make sure that this is not some kind of systematic error," Krikalev added.
The executive director clarified that on Saturday a commission began work, which will analyze all possible causes.
"The ship was supposed to be undocked and deorbited two days before the launch of the Soyuz spacecraft ("Soyuz MS-23" - TASS note), so there will be no serious consequences for the crew's actions, for the crew's work... From this point of view, it will not affect the program," noted Krikalev.
The "Progress MS-21" truck was launched from Baikonur on a Soyuz-2.1a carrier rocket on October 26.
Two days later, it docked with the Russian segment of the ISS’s small research module, “Pozisok”.
The ship delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS.
NASA named the location of the Progress depressurization
The depressurization of the Progress MS-21 cargo ship at the International Space Station (ISS) occurred in the thermal control system.
This was reported by a representative of the American Mission Control Center (MCC) during negotiations with the ISS crew, which was broadcast by NASA.
Now, according to NASA, the leak of coolant from Progress has stopped.
NASA believes that all of the coolant has been completely released.
"This morning we had a leak of coolant from the thermal control system into space, the coolant leak has stopped," said a representative of the American MCC (quoted by Interfax).
Previously, the Progress module was isolated due to a loss of pressure.
Roscosmos reported that the cosmonauts are not in any danger.
The Progress MS-22 docked with the ISS today, February 11, and it will be taken out of orbit, according to plan, on February 18.
John Kirby, the strategic communications coordinator at the US National Security Council, refused to announce a possible trip by US President Joe Biden to Ukraine.

The day before, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre announced Biden's visit to Poland from February 20 to 22.
As the administration representative stated, during the trip, the US president will discuss bilateral cooperation with the leadership of Poland, as well as collective efforts to support Ukraine and strengthen NATO's deterrence capabilities.
Earlier, Kirby said that Biden would visit Ukraine when the time was right, but now is not the time for official visits.
Fitness expert talks about winter outdoor training to reduce weight
Fitness expert named winter walks an excellent way to lose weight without intense exercise
Fitness expert Anthony Yeung spoke about an effective interval training on the street for weight loss.
His words are quoted by the Eat This, Not That portal.
The specialist called active walks in winter an excellent way to lose weight without intense exertion, as well as to improve the state of the cardiovascular system and psychological health.
"Walk at a normal pace for the first five to ten minutes to warm up your body and joints.
Then, for one minute, walk as fast as you can without breaking into a run.
One minute at a normal pace," explains Young.
It is necessary to make three approaches.
Next, the specialist advises doing jumps or squats with weights for 15 seconds, and then walking at a comfortable pace for another 45 seconds.
You need to repeat this sequence five times. Then, Young suggests alternating an active step (two minutes) and a calm one (one minute) three more times.
The walk should be finished with a five-minute walk at a calm pace and a few stretching exercises.

The head of Serpukhov checked the condition of the MKD
The head of the Serpukhov district, Sergey Nikitenko, conducted a working tour of the territories.
Together with representatives of management organizations, he inspected the condition of apartment buildings and residential homes.
The addresses from which the most appeals from residents were received were under the strictest control.
- Many of the comments are quite justified and concern, first and foremost, cleaning of the entrances and maintenance of common areas.
The people of Serpukhov themselves are not staying on the sidelines and are actively fighting the problem of vandalism, especially the widespread graffiti.
We will work on this issue, taking into account the Safe City cameras, said the head of the municipality, Sergei Nikitenko.
Attention was also drawn to the replacement of mailboxes, light bulbs, the installation of wiring in boxes, and the untimely removal of garbage from container sites.

The Deputy Director of RZD proposed that the Governor of Irkutsk Oblast develop new sales channels
Irkutsk region needs to continue developing alternative sales channels, in addition to the Far East.
This includes the domestic market and the ports of the Western direction, including the Azov-Black Sea basin.
This proposal was made by the Deputy CEO of Russian Railways, Alexei Shilo, at a meeting with Governor Igor Kobzev, the regional government reported on February 10, 2023.
- As last year's practice showed, even despite the geographical location of Irkutsk region, this decision can be extremely effective.
It is important that the logistics departments of companies constantly interact with our ‘adjacent’ parties (ports, operators, sea transport) and find the optimal pricing conditions for transporting their products along new routes, emphasized Aleksey Shilo.
The governor noted the importance of stable product shipments, and the Irkutsk region is one of the richest regions in Russia in terms of mineral resources and has significant reserves of hard and brown coal.
About 25 enterprises are engaged in coal mining in the region.
The instability of export product shipments has a negative impact on the financial and business activities of coal mining companies.
Igor Kobzev also emphasized that the Irkutsk region is an export-oriented region, so it is necessary to increase the size of monthly quotas for the transportation of timber and metallurgical products produced in the region to a level that ensures the stable operation of such enterprises.
- Understanding the importance of Irkutsk region as an industrial center, we, for our part, will try to do everything to provide support in terms of transport volumes.
If there are additional volumes of shipments to the domestic market, then we are also ready to provide assistance in this area, said Aleksey Shilo.
Konstantin Zaitsev held a meeting with the activists of the villages of Granovshchina and Khomutovo
At the request of the head of the region, Igor Kobzev, the Chairman of the Government of Priangarya, Konstantin Zaitsev, worked today in the villages of Granovshchina and Khomutovo in the Irkutsk region.
In the village of Granovshchina, the Head of Government inspected the work of a new educational institution, the Granovskaya School, which opened in September 2022.
The facility was built as part of the federal project "Modern School" of the national project "Education".
The following facilities are located in the eight school blocks: classrooms, a dining hall, a kitchen, an assembly hall, two gyms, club rooms, a library, administrative offices, toilets, common recreation areas, and a medical block.
240.8 million roubles were allocated from the federal budget for construction, more than 512 million roubles from regional funds, and more than 72 million roubles from municipal funds.
In addition, a regional subsidy was allocated for the purchase of equipment in the amount of 64.2 million roubles.
After the opening, in addition to children from Granovshchina, students from the Urikovskaya school, which was undergoing major repairs, also attended the school.
Classes are taught by more than 100 teachers, of which almost 90 are subject teachers.
In 2022, the school was allocated a bus purchased by the Russian Ministry of Industry and Trade under a federal programme.
Work on the major renovation of Khomutovskaya Secondary School No. 2 began in 2022.
The students in the lower grades were assigned to Khomutovskaya School No. 1, and the older grades attend the second building of School No. 2.
According to the renovation plan, the roof, engineering systems, windows and related elements will be replaced, the facade will be renovated, and the interior of the premises will be finished.
An important component of the capital repairs is the reconstruction of the heat point with water heating, which was replaced with dry heat.
The cost of all the work is more than 80 million roubles.
The renovation is in the final stages, there are problems with connecting to the power grid – we need to increase capacity, and we are working with the power supplier.
In addition, in Granovshchina and Khomutovo, Konstantin Zaitsev held a meeting with citizens, some of whom had bought homes that had been illegally connected to the electrical grid.
It was decided that the grid company will organize a personal reception next week to legally resolve these issues.
- Very often, the issue of stable electricity supply is the main condition when buying a house, because the population is increasingly using electricity for heating.
Therefore, sellers sometimes illegally connect homes to nearby networks, and this is already grounds for disconnecting the power supply.
Therefore, right now, network companies in those territories where active construction is underway must pay special attention to this issue, Konstantin Zaitsev emphasized.
Anatoly Prokopyev assessed the effectiveness of state support measures for farms in the Ulyanovsk region
The head of the UOB Anatoly Prokopyev visited three KFHs in Ekhirit-Bulagatsky District today.
The head of a small farm in the village of Kapsal, Yulia Madayeva, received a grant for the development of her farm as a beginner farmer in 2014.
One of the main areas of the farm's activity is the production of livestock products.
The livestock population is increasing every year, and the gross production of meat and milk is growing.
Later, thanks to state support, it became possible to participate and win a grant in the form of subsidies for the development of a family dairy farm in 2019.
Currently, the cattle population in the farm is about 150 heads, 60 of which are cows.
In addition, they grow grain crops and sow annual fodder crops.
Thanks to the activities of the KFH of Viktor Katanaev, the area of Kharyashino in the village of Kulunkun was transferred to the category of inhabited localities.
The farm is engaged in the cultivation and fattening of dairy cattle.
In 2014, a grant was received to develop a family dairy farm for 60 heads.
Currently, the farm has 150 head of cattle.
Potatoes have also been grown here for many years.
The head of the KFH tries to create all the necessary conditions for the team to work and live.
There is now a whole village on the territory of the farm.
Anatoly Prokopyev took personal control of the issue of building two km of road from Kharyashino to Ust-Ordynsky.
The main activities of the Stalina Mogzoeva LLC in the village of Otonkhoy are cattle breeding and buffalo breeding.
In 2020, the farm participated in a competitive selection and received an "AGROSTARTUP" grant for the development of a livestock farm.
With this money, a tractor trailer, two balers and a mower were purchased.
The head of the farm increases the number of livestock every year and increases the gross production of meat.
In addition, the KFH sows annual fodder crops on an area of 40 hectares.
Stalina Mogzoeva plans to open a fattening area.
Following the visit to three farms, the head of the district noted that state support measures are effective, necessary and required.
- The Irkutsk region government pays a lot of attention to agriculture.
Therefore, state support should not only be maintained, but also increased and improved.
We, in turn, must be the guarantor of food security.
Agricultural producers in the region are fulfilling this role with honour, - Anatoliy Prokopyev emphasized.
Crossing on Armenian-Turkish border opened for first time in decades for delivery of humanitarian aid
The Maragha-Alijan border crossing on the border between Turkey and Armenia was opened for the first time in three decades to deliver humanitarian aid to the earthquake victims.
This is reported by Turkish and Armenian media.
The same crossing was used to deliver humanitarian aid from Turkey to Armenia after the devastating earthquake of 1988, notes the Turkish agency Anadolu.
On Saturday, Armenia sent five trucks with 100 tons of food, medicine, water and other emergency aid packages to the city of Adiyaman in southern Turkey, said Serdar Kilic, Ankara's special representative for Armenian-Turkish negotiations.
He expressed gratitude to the Vice Speaker of the Armenian Parliament Ruben Rubinyan and the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Armenia Vahan Kostanyan.
"I will always remember the help provided by the people of Armenia to alleviate the suffering of our people in the earthquake-stricken region," Kılıç wrote on his Twitter page.
The press secretary of the Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Vahan Unanyan, in turn, reported that the trucks with humanitarian aid crossed the border via the Margara bridge and are heading to the earthquake-stricken region.
As Public Radio of Armenia reports, the last time the car crossed the Margara bridge was 30 years ago, in 1993.
Since then, the Armenian-Turkish land border has been closed.
The Turkish agency Anadolu cites other data and writes that the Maragha-Alijan border crossing was last used for the delivery of humanitarian aid to Armenia to address the consequences of the devastating earthquake of 1988.
Then, aid collected through the Turkish Red Crescent was sent to the disaster zone in Armenia.
Earlier, Armenia sent 27 rescuers to Turkey and another 29 rescuers to Syria to the earthquake-stricken areas.
According to the latest data, more than 25 thousand people died in Turkey and Syria from the devastating earthquake that occurred on Monday.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan reported on February 11 that 21,848 deaths have already been reported in Turkey.
The Syrian side reported 3,553 deaths.
Relations between Turkey and Armenia are clouded mainly by the fact that Ankara refuses to recognise the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire, and also supported Baku during the First and Second Karabakh Wars.
Recently, Yerevan and Ankara have made a number of attempts to normalize relations.
In 2021, Armenia and Turkey appointed special representatives who met several times in Vienna to discuss normalization issues.
In February 2022, commercial air traffic between Yerevan and Istanbul resumed after a two-year break.
In July 2022, Ankara and Yerevan agreed to open the land border for citizens of third countries as soon as possible.

Makhachev received a prestigious award from UFC - RT in Russian
Russian mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter Islam Makhachev received a prestigious award from the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), becoming the recipient of the "Submission of the Year" award for his early victory over Brazilian Charles Oliveira.
"Submission of the Year".
When I caught Oliveira and locked the door, I thought he would give up.
I knew my skills and I told the journalists and everyone around that I was going to strangle Charles.
And I beat the most dangerous grappler.
I know that I deserve this award.
Thank you," the UFC press service quotes the fighter as saying.
The fight for the vacant UFC lightweight championship belt between Makhachev and Oliveira, which took place in October 2022 at a tournament in Abu Dhabi, ended with the 31-year-old Russian winning by a handheld triangle choke in the second round.

In particular, he stated that he was impressed by the player's performance at the last World Cup.
According to him, the 22-year-old midfielder will be an excellent addition to the "blue" team, as he knows how to play in different positions.
"Fernandes is Makelele plus Lampard.
If you need him to play in the position of Makelele, he can play there very well.
This guy also has a good sense of goal, a good shot from outside the penalty area, so if you need him to play as a striker, like Lampard or Essien, he can do it," Crespo told the British media.

The game will begin at 22:00 Moscow time, and the live broadcast will be shown at 21:55 MSK on the matchtv.ru website and the Match! Football 2 channel.
Analysts from the betting company BETCITY consider "blancos" to be huge favorites: you can bet on Real's victory in regular time with a coefficient of 1.28, the probability is approximately 77%.
The nominal guests' success is available at 11.0 (8%).
Even a draw is offered at a significantly lower quote of 6.10 (15%).
Do you believe that the teams won't reveal the strongest in 90 minutes?
A bet of 1000 rubles on a “peaceful” outcome will bring 6100 rubles in the event of a win.
You can bet on a triumph for the Madrid team, taking into account extra time and a penalty shootout, for 1.14, this market on Al-Hilal is at 5.80.
The team from Saudi Arabia made it to the final by winning two rounds, beating the Moroccan "Wydad" in a penalty shootout and the Brazilian "Flamenco" in regular time (3:2).
You can bet that the underdog won’t lose to the Europeans in 90 minutes for 3.90.
Analysts are anticipating a large number of goals: the total of more than 2.5 balls is available for 1.53, TM 2.5 - for 2.60.
Blancos are clearly superior to their opponents, whose roster, according to the statistical website Transfermarkt, is only 39.6 million euros.

In addition, to the horror of Al-Hilal, the main striker of the Madrid team and the current holder of the Golden Ball, Karim Benzema, will recover by the final.

The Arabs' matches were also quite spectacular: in the quarterfinals they tied 1:1 and won in a penalty shootout, and in the semifinals they won 3:2 in a dramatic game.
Recommended bet: Real victory and TB 2.5 for 1.76.
Guberniev stated that midfielder Pavel Mamaev has decided to end his playing career.
Famous TV commentator Dmitry Guberniev said that midfielder Pavel Mamaev has decided to end his playing career.
"Now it will be possible to cast a bust in the hero's homeland.
He made a big mistake and for most people he will be remembered not as a footballer but as a football vandal.
But he is still far from Kokorin.
Because no one has managed to squander their potential like Kokorin.
Despite all his talents, Mamayev was periodically noticeable.
I can only wish him good luck and to realise himself somewhere else," Metaratings.ru quotes Guberniev as saying.
The last club of the 34-year-old midfielder was Khimki.
The Moscow region club did not renew the midfielder's contract in the summer of 2022.
Previously, Mamayev played for Torpedo, CSKA, Krasnodar and Rostov.
Mamayev is a Russian champion, three-time winner of the Russian Cup and two-time winner of the country's Super Cup with CSKA.

A tanker with diesel fuel from a vessel that previously sailed under the Russian flag was not allowed into a Spanish port
The Tarragona Naval Command of the General Directorate of the Merchant Navy at the Ministry of Transport of Spain has banned the Maersk Magellan vessel from entering the city's port to unload diesel fuel, as the cargo is from the Nobel vessel, which until July 1, 2022, sailed under the Russian flag, the Spanish Ministry of Transport reported.
"The Tarragona Maritime Command of the General Directorate of the Merchant Navy at the Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Development has prohibited the entry into the port of Tarragona for the unloading of diesel fuel on the Maersk Magellan ship under the Singapore flag, because the cargo it is carrying comes from the ship under the Cameroonian flag "Nobel", which until July 1, 2022, sailed under the Russian flag," the ministry said in a statement.
The measure was adopted in accordance with European Union legislation, which prohibits access for any vessel registered under the Russian flag from April 16, 2022, or that changed its flag after February 24, 2022.
The ministry clarified that the inspection was conducted on February 9, after which the ban was agreed upon.
The ministry recalled that this is not the first time that ships have been banned from entering Spanish ports.
In April 2022, the Black Star, a Maltese-flagged vessel carrying a cargo from a Russian-flagged vessel, was denied access to the port of Barcelona.
In 2022, after the strengthening of anti-Russian sanctions, the EU, the United States and Great Britain introduced restrictions on the supply of Russian petroleum products, and then decided to limit fuel prices.
Since December 5, 2022, the price ceiling on sea oil supplies from Russia introduced by unfriendly countries has been in effect.
At that time, a ceiling was set on Russian oil at $60/barrel.
Also, since December 5, the EU has imposed an embargo on sea oil shipments from Russia.
The problems that pregnant Russian women have had with entering Argentina have been explained
According to the expert, against the backdrop of the influx of people wanting to give birth in Argentina, the country's authorities have become more attentive to the entry of foreign citizens into their territory.
The difficulties with the entry of pregnant Russian women into Argentina are connected with the fact that the country's authorities are not interested in a massive influx of foreigners who want to obtain citizenship for their children and a residence permit for themselves, and then leave.
This was reported by Lenta.ru, citing St. Petersburg State University professor Victor Heifetz, editor-in-chief of the journal Latin America.
According to him, no country supports this practice.
He noted that Argentina does not approve of the country being turned into a transit point, rather than a final destination.
This applies to those who violate constitutional practice.
As the expert explained, the child will retain Argentine citizenship, but the decision on granting Argentine passports to the parents after obtaining a residence permit will be made by the court.
If it turns out that they did not actually live in Argentina and left right away, they may be denied citizenship.
This applies not only to Russians, but also to citizens of other countries.
Recently, as the specialist pointed out, maternity tours to Argentina are especially popular among Russians and Ukrainians.
Recall that Argentina grants citizenship by "right of the soil," that is, if a person is born on its territory.
An Argentine passport opens up the possibility of visa-free travel to 170 countries, including EU states and the UK.
Earlier it was reported that Argentina had begun to revoke the residence permits of Russians who had obtained the document through the birth of a child, but had left the country.
Buenos Aires is interested in reducing such cases.
It also became known that six pregnant Russian citizens were denied entry into Argentina due to suspicion of providing false information about the purpose of their trip.
In Russia, the opening of hundreds of new fitness clubs is predicted
In Russia, citizens are regaining interest in fitness services, which allows market participants to expand their business.
This year, more than 400 new facilities, primarily small-format ones, may open in the country.
In Russia, around 400 new fitness clubs may open, and their total number may increase by 5 percent.
As Kommersant reports, several dozen players may leave the Russian market.
By the end of the year, there will be around 8,600 clubs in Russia.
According to the publication, the majority of new clubs are small-scale projects with small initial investments and quick payback.
Such data is provided by representatives of the National Fitness Community.
The president of the Association of Fitness Industry Operators, Olga Kiselova, noted in a conversation with the publication that 340-420 new fitness clubs will be small, while the rest will occupy an area of more than 500 square meters.
The president of the NFS, Elena Silina, noted that since 2020, every year has seen more club closures than openings.
Over the past three years, their number has decreased by 37 percent.
At the same time, independent analysts cite different figures.
According to data from Kontur.Focus, over the past three years, the number of organizations with the primary type of activity "fitness center" has grown by 10.1 percent, and now there are 5,120 of them.
The industry suffered huge losses due to the pandemic, but it began to recover as early as 2021.
According to 2GIS, there are 4.5 thousand fitness clubs in Russian millionaire cities.
Russians have started to pay more attention to physical activity, as evidenced by the increase in attendance at fitness clubs.
As of the end of January 2023, attendance increased by 9.3 percent year-on-year.
As noted by Silina, if the trend is maintained, then by the end of the year the industry will return to pre-crisis indicators.
The management company from Kirov had its license revoked
The Arbitration Court of the Kirov Region has revoked the license for entrepreneurial activity in the management of apartment buildings, issued to the management company "Zabota".
In Kirov region, the regional Arbitration Court has revoked the license for entrepreneurial activity in the management of apartment buildings previously issued to the management company, "Zabota".
According to the regional State Housing Inspectorate, the court decision was made back in November 2022, but it only came into legal force in February 2023.
The arbitration court has revoked the license of the management company for the fact that the organization ignored the orders of the State Housing Inspectorate several times.
Currently, all facilities that were under the management of Zabota have been removed from the register of licenses for entrepreneurial activity in the management of apartment buildings.
Their total area was 64.8 thousand square meters.
All the houses are located in the regional centre.
The administration of Kirov knows that they are without a management company.
In accordance with the requirements of Russian legislation, the State Housing Inspectorate informed the mayor about the situation.
To recap, in January 2023, the governor of the Kirov region, Alexander Sokolov, set a task for the staff of the State Housing Inspectorate to eliminate 2/3 of the region’s management companies by the spring, as there are too many of them.
The legality of the governor's demands has caused doubts among the Kirov communists.
They appealed to the regional prosecutor's office and asked that Sokolov be held administratively liable.
Presumably, the Federal Antimonopoly Service could have taken the same position.
Antimonopoly officials also allegedly asked the prosecutor's office to check the legality of the actions of the head of the region.
Wildberries will make packages in pickup points pay-to-use
The Wildberries marketplace will make bags at order pickup points payable from February 13.
Their cost will range from 6 to 15 roubles.
Now the packages are provided by the owners of the order pickup points.
In the absence of these, a fine is imposed.
Starting on Monday, February 13, packages at Wildberries pickup points will no longer be free.
Users of the marketplace received a notification according to which buyers who need a bag will have to pay between 6 and 15 roubles for it.
This amount will be debited from the card specified in the personal account.
As the company indicated, this step will help reduce the use of plastic and will contribute to the preservation of nature.
As follows from the annex to the offer of services for the delivery of consignments to individuals, the executor, i.e. the person who opened the pickup point, must provide the packages free of charge at the client's request.
At the same time, they must be designed in certain colors and have a specified image.
The bags are purchased at the expense of the owners of the VVZ, and if this obligation is not fulfilled, they are subject to a fine of 10,000 roubles for each violation.
Previously, Wildberries customers accused the site of withdrawing funds from cards whose data had previously been deleted from the personal account.
As buyers fear, this is associated with great security risks.
The support service, in turn, explained that this is provided for in the user agreement.
As follows from it, the company has the right to debit money from remote cards without notifying the client if payment from other sources does not go through for one reason or another.
The company, commenting on the situation, stated that payments to customers are made with the customers' permission, and that there can be no leak of bank card data.

There is a not very large park on the territory where you can take a walk with your family.
Large car park.
The store is located on the first floor of the Univer City shopping center.
Hours of operation from 10-00 to 22-00.
In the store, you can have a coffee and a snack of freshly baked goods.
There is a small parking lot from the mall.
Friendly staff!
Delicious coffee, a wide selection of syrups and alternative milk.
The most delicious fresh baked goods😍😍😍.
Hearty sandwiches.
Comfortable cafeteria area
I came with my daughter to get my pension.
They welcomed me, explained everything clearly, scanned my documents, processed my application, and told me how to book subsequent appointments.
At the entrance, the administrator and security personnel greet you in a cultured and respectful manner.
The building is decent, everything is equipped for people - there is a hall, a toilet, but it wouldn't hurt to buy a water cooler.
Came twice, everything was great!
I wish all workers peace, good, luck and a decent salary, in this difficult time for everyone!!!
Just a great place!
After a long walk on the beach, there is nothing better than sitting by the window with a cup of mulled wine while waiting for the scallop salad (which is simply delicious!!!)
I strongly recommend this wonderful place!!!)))
A lovely cashier asked me if I wanted my coffee to go or in the lounge, 200 or 300 ml.
I asked for 300 ml in the hall.
After a couple of minutes, I am given a plastic cup.
I wanted to do ceramics, so I'm in the "ceramics room".
They did it to me.
I ask why in a shot glass and not a cup.
The girl replies that they don't have cups with a capacity of 300 ml.
How does this fit in a person's head?
Ask yourself or in the room, i.e. determine the technology for yourself: pour the coffee into a cup or a disposable cup.
To get an answer - in the hall, i.e. in a cup.
Please specify the volume.
To hear that 300 ml.
To make the person face the fact that there are no cups of that size.
Here, they say, a paper cup, 300 ml.
It is noteworthy that this is the third such case in Zelenograd on my memory.
It is doubly remarkable that I was not offered a standard cup so that I could pour the contents of the plastic cup into it and drink the coffee the way I wanted to. I asked for it myself.
A number of questions arise.
1. Are the Green Okolitsa Cafeteria and the Green Okolitsa organization two sides of the same coin or are they not connected in any way?
If not connected, understanding appears.
If they are connected, why has a food and retail establishment known in the city for its service and quality sunk to the level of the rhetoric of a kiosk at Kazansky Station?
Rhetoric because, I repeat, this is the third time this has happened to me.
I don't rule out that this happens not only to me.
2. Does the cashier have instructions?
I got the impression that she was acting on impulse.
I hope I am wrong.
Please write down the actions for your employees in case you are trying to be helpful.
We really like the circus, we have been going there since we were children.
I saw the numbers with Y. Nikulin himself.
And now with children and nephews.
I like the atmosphere at the circus, and the programmes too.
The location of the places is very convenient.
You can see the arena from almost any point, and the backs of those sitting in front of you don't get in the way.
The circus is very intimate, family-oriented!
this time we went to the New Year's program.
A little bit disappointed.
Lots of clowns and acrobats.
I would like a room with magic tricks and more animals.
It's a shame that you can't take photos with the animals in the foyer anymore.
But apparently there are reasons for this.
And in general, a very nice place!!
I wish you prosperity and to please us with your numbers!!!
I liked the developer Otdelstroy, they choose good locations for building residential complexes.
They use high-quality materials, which fully justifies the price.
Before the purchase, we were invited to look at the complex, when there were not even walls yet, so that we could see everything in person, although we looked at apartments with many developers and none of them offered us this.
Russia's favorite ski resort!
The most fun is in the gentle, sparse forests, especially when there is a lot of soft snow.
But the tracks are boring and short, in my opinion.
The longest on sector e, there are more or less.
But overall a great atmosphere, lots of different cafes and bars so a fun skiing vibe is guaranteed!
Great work Peri!
She did everything as quickly and as well as possible, the salon is clean and pleasant.
Good service, friendly staff, there is a cloakroom and water.
Horrible service.
This is the second time I come to pick up my order at the time of readiness, which is indicated in the application, and I wait for my order at the window for more than 30 minutes.
Today, such service is unacceptable in business!
The Care response is that we are trying.
At the checkout, even without an apology, just - we're not to blame, it's the program.
You didn't call to warn them, and you didn't find any other technical means of communicating with your previously loyal customers.
Impotents are trying, but business must work.
Thank you all, we are leaving.
We won't order from you again and we won't recommend you to anyone.
A bad mood, waiting for guests, apologies from the hostess - not the best sauce for hot rolls.
I ordered a car (Jeep Wrangler Sahara) through the organization.
I was expecting to receive the car in 3-3.5 months (as was agreed), but it actually took 4.5 months - the delay was caused by the situation on the Lithuanian-Belarusian border (Lithuania was responsible for this).
In the end, I am very happy with the car, thanks to the guys - Dmitry, Stas, and Alexander - always available, up-to-date information, professional advice, and a normal human attitude.
Thank you again!
We rented a house for 4 days for 3 people.
The cottages are clean, cozy, and warm (even very warm), and each cottage has its own small kitchen with coffee, tea, sugar, spices, sunflower oil, and all necessary dishes.
There is detergent and a sponge.
The only downside is that there is not enough space, and the shower in the bathroom is tiny.
There are no designated places to store snowboards or skis, and there is no good place to dry clothes, so we had to borrow a dryer from the owners and cram it in for a chair, and put a heater underneath it.
But in general, it's a good option in a quiet place.
Stylish, clean, spacious.
The food is tasty, and the selection of dishes is sufficient for the needs of any guest.
Prices are reasonable.
There is wine and beer for those who want to drink.
The center of Moscow, I recommend
A wonderful place with very polite staff, we will definitely come again.
The territory has all necessary amenities, including parking and billiards.
Rooms with good repair and all amenities.
A beautiful and aesthetic place, we walked around during our visit to Kaliningrad.
I really enjoyed it, and Russia in miniature, and Ozerov park and the landscape.
In winter there are many slopes that are natural for children)
A very cool tobacco and hookah shop)
We constantly shop here, prices are low, and the quality is great!
Very responsive staff, will advise and answer all questions of interest)
I recommend this store to everyone to visit! ❤️
Location is convenient for everyone.
For me personally, it's normal.
They serve quickly, if any of the visitors aren't slow.
It is convenient to make an appointment.
The staff is attentive, they will give advice, direct you, and provide consultations even if you come on days when they are not accepting patients.
In principle, it's fine.
Great guys!
Thank you so much!
Everything was done quickly and efficiently, and the prices are reasonable compared to other services.
I thought it was a remote control for the ejector, but they are all so clever and they did it for me.
Huge thanks to the young guys!
I ordered a bouquet of 21 tulips with delivery 2 hours before March 8.
They brought the flowers in a package after 6 hours, as if they had been stolen (there was just enough paper to wrap the flowers).
Then, when the flowers were already in the vase, I realized that something was wrong.
I compared it to the photo on the website and the color was completely different from what I ordered.
I decided to count and it turned out that there were an even number of 20 tulips.
Support in WhatsApp to my complaints about the color and the number of colors replied "apparently they mixed up the color".
The next day I wrote again and was offered a 15% refund.
I think this is the ultimate in cheek and most likely falls under the definition of fraud.
I have already sent a statement to the tax office about the fact that they refused to give me a receipt.
Rospotrebnadzor and the court are next in line.
I would not recommend anyone to get involved with this organization.
For more than 10 years I have been going to the master Samir for hair coloring and haircuts.
I want to cancel the Professionalism of the master Samira, she does her job perfectly, I am always satisfied with her work.
She always listens carefully to the client's wishes, and the client is always satisfied with the result.
I would recommend this master to all my family and friends.
All her work is always done to the highest standard !!!’
A huge thank you to Master Samira 😍
I have been to this gaming club and I can say that the prices are great, there are a lot of gaming computers, and there are drinks and food.
Among the cons, some keyboards have broken keys that fly off, and if you take the “usual gameplay” into account, the computers are not very powerful :(
Therefore, a rating of 4🥸
This place has become our family tradition)
The son goes to his group, and the mother does fitboxing in the evening.
The administrators are super-attentive, the coaches are professional.
They organize themed holidays for children, keep an eye on cleanliness and exercise equipment.
It's nice to walk and exercise.
The 6-year-old child already takes a hit well, strong OFP.
Recommendations for children, moms and dads)
The best craftsmen!
Irina is just gold!!
The work is done well, the person is caring, and they clarify everything.
You can always chat with girls about something!
It was the third time!
I will not regret it for anything!
Finally I can grow my hair after lightening it!!!
And Vita is also studying color theory.
That is why it will be the first to be able to combine blond with keratin soon!
And your hair will say THANK YOU🥰🥰
The receptionist, Elena Polyanskaya, is a very helpful person, and explained everything that is included in the scheduled maintenance in a clear manner.
Also, during the repair of my car, she provided all kinds of assistance.
And also gratitude to the master Valery Ushakov for the attentive and professional work.
He was ready to answer any question.
The work was done well.
The only thing that was confusing when scheduling the service was the insufficiently correct information on the work regulations, but when I showed up for the service, the regulations were explained more clearly.
I want to express my deep gratitude to the Administration staff.
A very rare certificate for the guardianship authorities was needed to approve the real estate transaction, and the staff were very friendly and helped to issue this certificate, even though they could have refused, as it is not their responsibility.
Thank you very much!
Very kind people work here.
Wonderful, kind, polite staff, I don't regret coming to this particular hairdresser's!👍
Master Nakhida did an impeccable highlighting, haircut, took into account and understood all my wishes, I definitely recommend her to everyone❤️
I really enjoyed the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin.
It was restored for the 800th anniversary, and it's stylish and clean inside.
There are also cafes and toilets for tourists.
I went on an excursion, it was great too.
And I definitely recommend the Russian collection of the Nizhny Novgorod Art Museum - an unexpectedly beautiful collection
I have known Olya for more than 3 years, and we use her services regularly.
During this time, we have seen how Olya develops in her favourite field, constantly learns new things and expands the space for four-legged creatures, which only inspires admiration and trust.
We always leave our pets with a peaceful mind.
Daily video reports, if necessary, will be taken/brought away by a taxi for animals.
And they will also bring a clean and tasty one)
it's a fairy tale 🥰
Thank you for the care and personal attention to our pets 🐕💜
The Sytin Losos restaurant is located near the Medvedkovo metro station.
The restaurant is very cozy!
They prepare delicious dishes.
The menu is diverse.
It is advisable to book seats in advance, especially on Fridays!
A lovely well-kept zoo.
Less than Moscow, but just as interesting and convenient.
We went on a weekday - adult admission was 300₽, schoolchild 170.
There were few people, we went for a walk with pleasure, looked at the animals.
The ant-lion impressed)
In Moscow, by the way, he was not seen.
There are a couple of cafes with reasonable prices, the toilet is clean and free, and we also saw a phone charging station.
In general, I recommend 👍
Salon at the highest level!!!
I am very satisfied with the services of the cosmetologist Kuznetsova Natalia, I only go to her.
I do various facial cleanses - both with a machine and manually.
100% satisfied.
A master of his craft👍
She explains everything in detail about the skin, picked out skincare products that are suitable for my skin type, just perfect.
I now walk happy and beautiful!!!
Thank you Natalia!!!
Great club with huge space, pool, sauna, hammam and great trainers!
One of the downsides is the huge number of pensioners in the pool and in the changing room area.
It feels like they come to the club like they are coming to a public bath house!
A special emphasis on the women's department.
On weekdays, starting at 7:00 PM, there are a lot of people!
I give it three stars, and that's only because of the first visit, when I was seen by a consultant, if I'm not mistaken, Timur, but I could be wrong.
He processed everything quickly, explained everything +/- clearly, my son also decided to process the card, and unfortunately the consultants were busy with their own affairs, clients were waiting, a consultant approached my son in the end, who knew everything down to the last detail, he looked into the booth several times, discussing something amusing, in the end my son left without processing anything, the consultant said, well, if you don't want to, then don't, as I was present at this meeting, I was surprised.
A new office, in a new format, everything is comfortable and the attitude is like that.
It's a shame that the first impression was ruined, now we visit another branch, and there the attitude towards customers does not depend on the shift of employees.
The selection is very large, the quality is good (the fabric is resistant to puckering), the staff knows their range, they help with choosing styles.
You can dress both a slim child and one with a non-standard figure and height.
Located close to the metro, even a small parking lot is available.
We recommend!
He was there in September, celebrating his birthday.
In principle, everything was fine with the service and the quality of the food: prices are low, portions are medium-sized, so you can eat enough, or you can order again.
The only complaint is about booking a table.
When I ordered, I gave them my number and everything, and then the bot immediately called to verify the phone.
There is nothing else.
When I arrived at the restaurant itself, it turned out that the table had not been reserved.
We were lucky that there were free seats and we were able to be accommodated.
But, in fact, a very good restaurant with an excellent price/quality ratio.
I recommend it!
I went to get my teeth cleaned on the recent weekend.
For the first time I saw such an organized staff, who treated many of my questions with the utmost care, and suggested how and what to do to further treat my dental cavity.
I wholeheartedly recommend it, the only clinic where they don't want to make money off of me that I can remember.
A good shopping center.
Everything is there!
A wide range of products.
Variety of shops.
You can always find a product to your liking.
From food to gifts.
not a foot in that store again.
bought a washing machine, said that we are outside the city, so we will deliver it ourselves.
the manager in the room said where to drive up to the warehouse, on the question "will they load it?" he said yes. ))
at the warehouse they took out without a box, when asked why? they answered that they load everything like that.
when I started to insist, they gave me two strips of foam plastic, like it'll do!
they refused to load the trailer, saying it's not their job, load it yourself, they have delivery )))
when I said that I would refuse the order altogether, they said "whatever you want, we don't care," in the end, one of them stooped so low as to come down from the ramp and help his father shove the car into the trailer.
I have never encountered such rude service before.
Good shopping center, very neat. A large selection of shops and cafes with restaurants.
There is a Cosmic cinema and the Nevidalia entertainment center for children.
On the lower floor there is a large Lenta hypermarket.
Convenient, large parking lot, convenient location.
A good supermarket for cosmetics, underwear and household goods.
A diverse range of products, reasonable prices, polite, attentive staff.
Consultants will definitely help with the selection and provide advice.
Everyone will find something they need.
A good place to spend an evening.
The staff is very good, a pleasant establishment.
I recommend that everyone never make a mistake in their choice. The best establishment in Krasnodar, where you can relax and everything will be super.
I recommend visiting)
We would like to express our gratitude to Clock Marina, who was our agent for organizing the funeral.
Having arrived at our place on call, she took on the solution of all issues related to this difficult and sad event, helped us choose everything we needed, was always in touch and informed us of how things were going.
Thanks to her, we were able to give a loved one a decent send-off.
Everything was formalized, clearly organized, as we discussed at our first meeting.
Marina, who was well aware of the state of our loved ones, gave us advice on how to make things better and simply sympathized with us.
He is a very good specialist in his field.
Thank you for everything.
Lured by the many good reviews, I contacted "RemStyrmash" and they assigned me master Alexander.
He began the conversation by saying that he was completely free the next day and ready to serve.
Everyone discussed it and set a time - 2 p.m.
The next day came - a call in the morning from the master and a statement that he would not be able to come, a complicated request (what is it? and where is the "completely free?"), and if he can, then instead of the appointed 14.00 he will come after 18.00.
We agreed to meet again the next day.
15 minutes before the appointed time, another master calls and says that instead of Alexander, he can come, but in 2 hours.
What kind of tricks are these?
A day and a half of empty waiting, all planned tasks put aside!
In short, a skilled master, Ivan, came, fixed the breakdown, for which I am grateful.
So don't be fooled by empty promises and don't waste your time.
The evening observations did not live up to expectations at all.
First there was a small lecture with incomprehensible material, then we looked through a telescope.
Everything was not very organized, children would watch several times, adults would crowd and not let others watch.
The objects we looked at in the telescope were the size of a regular star, and you can look at them for free without a telescope.
The girl answered the questions not very clearly, not understanding that ordinary people do not know many of the nuances.
It is not clear why 600r.
An amazing place, one of the oldest Mexican restaurants in the city, has been around since the early 2000s.
Cozy atmosphere, always friendly service.
The price is average.
To sit down, eat 2-3 dishes for two (portions are very large) + a cocktail, about 2500 p.
There are interesting beer cocktails, based on beer and tequila, for example, Macho Borracho, I highly recommend trying.
Price 420 r for 0.5 l.
And in general, the restaurant itself has very tasty food, I don't know about others, but I really enjoyed it, I will definitely recommend my friends to go there)
A great store, I have been buying products from them for quite some time, since the opening.
Good quality products.
I bought a mixer, it's been five years already, and it works perfectly and is in good condition.
Therefore, when we did a major renovation in the apartment, we bought everything we needed here.
Excellent service!!!
It is located very conveniently, it is both near the center and near the outskirts of the region, in general, it is convenient)!
The gas quality is good, I fill up 2 times a week for more than 2 years, there are no problems, the price is excellent!!!
The eaglets are not cheating on the map and for cash, by the litre.
The store was great!
You can choose any model, at a democratic price, and for any purpose!
Staff are always on hand to help with choices.
I took my daughter's laptop for her to study on, because her laptop was covered.
Helped, picked up, gave a guarantee (a month) Thank you! 👍
The sommelier is working.
he helped me choose the wine, because it's hard to figure out what to choose from such a large menu.
Working with sommelier Vasily is interesting and charming, there are not enough of them in Moscow.
I ate pikeperch - it was magical, chef, respect.
Children's menu as everywhere: macaroni, fries, chicken cutlets. I had pizza, it's FIRE here!
Adults liked the truffle, and children liked the sausage and mushrooms.
My husband ate smoked ribs - it's a bomb, soft, juicy, fragrant.
The staff is good, everyone is smiling, friendly.
We liked it.
The brand new WB order pickup point is located in a convenient location.
The schedule is from 10:00 to 21:00, with no days off or holidays.
There are fitting rooms inside the PVZ.
A very good place.
Here, real professionals work who are always ready to help.
There is also a group and a chat in WhatsApp for informative communication.
Fast delivery.
It is great that you can immediately look at and try on the goods.
It's great that it's near the house.
Excellent, modern hotel.
The room is spacious, very clean and cozy.
Everything that is stated in the description is in stock.
Breakfast is included in the price, a large selection of dishes for every taste.
Convenient entrance, its own parking lot near the entrance.
Firm 5.
A wonderful puppet theatre.
We often go to various performances.
Today we went to see the "The Frog Princess" show.
At the moment, this is the best of the children's shows.
It was very interesting, lots of puppets, special effects.
Even my 14-year-old son went just for company, but he said it was a really good show.
I vacationed with my husband for 10 days in January 2023.
The vacation was a "5", everything was great!
I will start in order:
On the day of arrival, they called us, asked what time to expect us, gave us information about the cost of the transfer (1400 from the airport), we ordered a taxi (at 23:00 the price was 850r), we arrived quickly, there were no traffic jams, they let us through the barrier without any problems.
The administrative building is nearby, and it was processed quickly, in 15-20 minutes.
There is an elevator in all the buildings, which is a big plus!
The 2-bedroom suite is spacious, with warm floors in both the bedroom and bathroom (no underfloor heating), a huge balcony with rattan furniture (a table and two chairs), and panoramic windows (in building 5).
The furniture in the room is normal, there is a dressing table with a large mirror, the fridge is not too small, and there is even a freezer.
There are a lot of green plants in building 5.
Everything is clean, they change towels and linen as you wish, but if you don't ask them to change, they still change it on the 4th day, good quality linen.
The territory is well-maintained, there are benches everywhere, clean paths, and beautiful lighting at night.
A minibus takes people to the beach and back every 30 minutes.
5 min. to public transport stop.
In the dining hall, the friendly guys will always wish you a good day.
The food is decent, but everyone comes here for something different, we were all satisfied, and there was always a choice and quality, there was always fish, chicken, and meatballs, etc., vegetables as a side dish every day, their own tasty baked goods, more than 4 drinks, coffee with grains, pancakes are always cooked for breakfast, but the cheese and sausage are not very good.
The medical staff is very friendly and loyal.
We were also lucky with the weather, there was no rain, the temperature was 11-16°C, and the sun was shining.
We liked everything, we really relaxed.
There is a desire to come again and in January, when there are few vacationers)).
It is a pity that the swimming pool and the gym will not be put into operation.
Thank you to the entire sanatorium staff for their coordinated and high-quality work!
We have been going to Polyot since August.
Doche turned 4 in September.
She likes everything very much, the coach praises her) that's the most important thing.
We're going to see Valeriya Nikolaevna Pleshkova!)
I never thought my daughter was so flexible!
Wandering around the streets of St. Petersburg, my friends and I decided to check out this promising establishment - and we were not disappointed!
Prices are very affordable, and the incredibly tasty pizza is eaten in the blink of an eye, not even a crumb is left.
Nice atmosphere and charming staff, in short, I recommend it :)
It just so happened that I ended up in the Tomarovka hospital with high blood pressure and a rapid heartbeat.
And I was extremely surprised: cleanliness, order, wet cleaning 2 times, moreover, the windowsills, furniture, and doors are wiped down.
The food is healthy, but excellent!!!
I was surprised that at 7 am they brought tea with a sandwich (bread, butter, cheese), so to speak, a pre-breakfast.
The medical staff is attentive, everyone gives both intramuscular and intravenous injections!!!
As long as the drip is in, they will come in, ask about your health...
I had an ultrasound of my heart before, but this was the first time (unfortunately, I don't know the doctor's name, he's a young man).
Special thanks to the attending physician Vetokhina Klavdiya Fedorovna!
A true professional: attentive, knowledgeable, gives a comprehensive answer to any question; she selected the dosage and medications, which normalized both my blood pressure and heart rate, which I was unable to achieve after seeing other doctors.
A huge thank you to the chief physician, Olga Vladimirovna Meshcheryakova, who organized the hospital's smooth operation!!!
Thank you to the medical staff, the nurses, and the drivers!
The visit to the customer service left a good impression.
In the hall, I met the administrator.
Knowledgeable and polite specialists help clients promptly and patiently with all the questions asked.
The specialist helped me fill out the application and provided clarification on my issue.
For a small store, it's a very good selection of goods.
There are semi-finished products, dairy products, vegetables, household chemicals, and various small items.
It operates 24/7, which is very convenient, and the staff is always friendly.
It's great when there is a place in the city where you can go mountain biking.
The gondola lift, of course, has a queue on weekends, 40 seconds for the descent and 5-10 minutes for the queue.
But overall, it's great, immersion in the atmosphere of positivity and winter, even if the roads are muddy and damp.
I contacted the service for repair of an iPhone 11 pro.
The rear window was broken and the battery needed to be replaced.
I contacted the master, Alexander, directly, who explained all the intricacies of the repair and immediately specified the price range.
Thank you for the repairs, everything was done well.
The masters are very pleasant to talk to, they will show you everything and tell you everything.
However, when the parts were replaced, the camera was damaged and the focus was lost.
I immediately reported the problem and received a quick response.
The error was corrected in the shortest possible time, everything is working properly.
This service has good specialists with whom it is a pleasure to conduct a dialogue.
Prices, in comparison with other services, are reasonable, and they are accommodating.
If repairs are needed again, I will definitely contact you!
Grand, beautiful, atmospheric.
But, like most historical objects, the condition requires close, prompt and high-quality attention from restorers.
So 4 and most of these stars are given to the creators, not the owners
Great movie
Responsive concierges, garbage is cleaned up, clean and beautiful on the territory, close to stops, schools and shops.
20 minutes to the metro by public transport
They opened a good, cozy recreation area in our district.
There are all the necessary shops.
A killer and diverse food court.
The tables are arranged in cozy areas.
There is no boredom.
Well, we visited, we tried...
The interior has nothing in common with a cozy Italian cafe...
There is very little space, the tables are rectangular, like in a canteen.
Pizza... well, who hasn't tried something tastier, so I thought it was a bit faceless.
I didn't like the fact that the waiter was always standing behind your back and was practically always looking your companion in the face.
We were uncomfortable.
Connolly, yes, they are tasty.
We won't come here again and won't recommend it to our friends.
Lena Grosskopff is the best hairdresser and makeup artist I have ever been to.
She does everything very neatly and with quality, I go to her with pleasure, I understand that everything will be done perfectly.
I take my daughter to see Len only.
The cabin atmosphere is amazing.
Thank you so much!
We broke down on the way from Nizhny, but kind people from Kateresurs quickly responded and helped!
Respect to you and prosperity, there should be more good people like you!
And in the server there it's clean and good!
We came to see Sergei Chigrakov's concert.
A great concert venue, wonderful sound and atmosphere.
We will definitely come to the planned concerts this year.
Quiet place, wonderful Georgian restaurant, live music on weekends and holidays!
Staff is nice and responsive!
There is a children's room.
Amazing Georgian cuisine!
Rating is the highest, I adore this place ❤
Park in the city center, very easy to get to.
The park is clean, and there is room for both children and adults.
But there has been no sand in the playground for a long time, just dust.
There is also a fenced football pitch, which, unfortunately, is not very well-maintained.
But there are more advantages to our park.
Spacious hall, clean, clear layout of goods.
There are products that can only be bought at Peregorodok.
The staff is friendly.
I didn't get any bad products.
Often sales and discounts.
It is great that it is close to home.
You can always find a parking space.
We went to the bar twice, everything was great, polite staff, tasty food and most importantly - great music, the DJs know their stuff.
The only thing is that the lead singer of the "Ruki Vverh Band" is disappointing for the second time.
Not only does he sing softly, but he also reads the lyrics of most of the songs from his phone, and it was especially striking when it was songs by the group "Ruki Vverh".
That's kind of illogical (playing in the Up Periscope bar, in the Up Periscope Band group).
We went on holiday at the beginning of March.
A good hotel, nice rooms.
In honor of the birthday, they gave us a room with a view of the Kremlin.
Room cleaning every day.
Replenishment of water, tea, coffee, shampoo and change of towels.
Breakfasts are just a pile of crap.
There is a mini bar with crazy prices.
If you want to order a meal from the restaurant to your room, you will have to pay a 20% service charge on top.
The prices in the restaurant are slightly inflated.
Tastes like three plus.
The water park was included in the cost of accommodation.
The water park itself cannot be called the best in Russia.
But the masseur was just amazing.
Everything is fine, but the departure was a bit disappointing: no goodbye or good luck.
The employee at the entrance didn't even help open the door when he saw the women with a bunch of bags and suitcases.
We need to work on this to keep the brand.
A great place to get together with friends and have a sauna.
A large and comfortable sauna, billiards, an outdoor pool, karaoke.
Food is tasty, drinks are fresh)
Workshop at the highest level!
In a short time, I have already repaired 3 pairs of shoes (2 men's and 1 women's).
Everything is fine.
The quality of work is excellent.
Special thanks to the master for his careful attitude and quality of work!
A wonderful basketball school!
My son has been going for 5 months and he loves it, he looks forward to every session.
An individual approach to children, interesting activities, a warm and friendly atmosphere.
The store is great, the staff is nice, I order online myself.
Great location for the store.
Plus there are always discounts and sales, which is also good
A good car shop - convenient location, large hall, good range.
Special thanks to the staff for their kindness!
There is a cafeteria for several tables.
I often come here - everything is fine!
Nice pool!
I am specifically talking about "Little Frog", our coach, Anastasia Vitalyevna, is very much liked by the child and is professional!!
The changing rooms are clean, the water is warm, and there are hairdryers!
I love the bakery croissants, service, breakfasts and coffee are always top notch.
But alas, not this time, I ordered coffee and a couple of croissants, the girls at the cash register never made the coffee, until I reminded them, they made it, it was impossible to drink, it smelled and left a taste of spoiled milk, I decided not to finish it and just left.
Last time there was a long black hair in my coffee, they replaced it.
Please be more careful, as I am a returning guest here, even after such incidents.
Gorgeous eyebrows are here!
Victoria corrects perfectly, taking into account all the proportions of the face individually.
Warm wax correction, which removes all the fluff well, and the eyebrows look neat for a long time.
The color is selected based on the type of hair and skin, which is why the dye lasts for a long time.
Better not to do eyebrows!
A huge thank you for organising my mum's move!
Moving is always a huge stress, but with your company everything went very smoothly, quickly, and efficiently.
Special thanks to Vadim and Roman!
I will recommend your company to all my friends!
Everything is top-notch.
We have been treating our family's teeth in Novodent for a long time.
Recently, I had my 8-year-old son's teeth treated, and everything went just perfectly, the child is calm and ready to come back again.
You don't have to wait long, there are no queues because the reception is by appointment.
In my opinion, the most delicious shawarma in Tambov is only here, I am not a fan of shawarma, BUT when I want something naughty, only here and only here.
Tasty, fresh meat with lots of stuffing.
And I just don't understand why, but it never flows for me.
Often when you finish a shawarma you don't eat the bottom because there's a lot of water-based sauce, well, fuck that... but not here.
That's why you guys are the best🙂
Good teaching staff.
In the dining hall they always serve fresh food.
Interesting lessons in the school museum, various events are held throughout the school year
Nice store, polite staff, good assortment.
However, the big minus is that the goods that are brought in are apparently destroyed right in the store.
Sometimes there is little space to walk between the rows, and it is also not very pleasant when the goods are just lying on the floor, without pallets, but this is more of a comment on the organization, rather than a comment on a specific store.
A delightful example of Soviet architecture.
Strict magnificence, which is carefully looked after.
I got double pleasure from the concert, largely thanks to the atmosphere of the cultural center.
As we waited to start in the foyer, I could definitely feel that I was going to an Event, that this was really a night out.
I was looking for a clutch kit for my MB Sprinter.
I completely by chance came across this online auto parts store.
I called, entered the voucher code, and they said to wait)
They called back after 10 minutes and offered several options.
Since the car is a personal work vehicle, he didn't want to save money and asked for a good LUK clutch kit.
Another 5 minutes later they called back and said that there was good news for you.
If you don't take the whole basket + disc + straw, but take the LUK basket + disc set and the LUK straw separator separately, it will be cheaper by 2 thousand rubles, which was not a pleasant surprise.
After taking off the clutch, I went to the service center.
When the gearbox was removed, it was discovered that the flywheel was also needed, and the faster the better.
(I already knew where to turn), the manager understood the situation and ordered without prepayment by phone (the first time he also paid upon receipt).
The following day the flywheel was in his hands.
The car is quite happy with the new flywheel and clutch, I am happy that everything arrived quickly and that they were accommodating.
I will definitely recommend and apply to vinkod.shop
The New Year's party was a success, but with some nuances.
I booked a table for two, but they seated me at a table for four.
But no problem.
It's just strange that they didn't warn us.
The meal for four was a failure, the fish was inedible.
A host with contests made at a high school level is, frankly, not very good.
BUT everything is perfect with the music.
The atmosphere was great.
Everything else seems like nitpicking.
Thank you for the event
I am leaving my review with words of gratitude to all the staff of maternity hospital number 7 in Chelyabinsk.
This institution employs only people who know and love their work, doctors and nurses from God.
Both in the OBGYN department, and in the maternity ward, and in the postpartum ward.
But I want to express my special gratitude to Kotlyarova E.Y., the head of the maternity ward on the 5th floor, and Yarantseva N.V., the midwife in the maternity ward, thank you so much for your help at the birth of my daughter, for your kind heart, and for your great professionalism.
A wonderful store.
A large assortment of balls, always quick order processing and delivery.
Professional staff.
Very beautiful bouquets, always left with great taste, always fresh flowers.
We visited the establishment on the recommendation.
Food amazing, program nonexistent, a bit cheeky waiters but we were in great company with kids and celebrating an important event, were friendly.
There was no fire delivery plateau, the children waited.
You can safely go for good food.
