The July issue is traditionally released during the Moscow Film Festival, and this, of course, is very sad: to read the strips when the soul is eager for Chabrol.
Nevertheless, we will talk about the MIFF next time (for now I’ll just complain that this year the inexplicable idea that the happy owners of purchased tickets is many times more important for the festival than accredited guests has finally strengthened in the minds of the organizers, a ridiculous and completely offensive principle, which no normal film festival in the world is guilty of), and in this issue we report on what we saw in Cannes and at Kinotavr.
The cover of the July issue is graced by another pleasant face - the title character of the film "Predators" produced by Robert Rodriguez, and inside the magazine, try not to miss the story about "Inception" by Christopher Nolan (the man, by the way, who rebooted "Batman..."), the most anticipated film of the summer.
And this time we are publishing the first part of a fairly detailed guide to the work of Alfred Hitchcock, and here there is certainly no need to specifically advertise anything, and it’s a no brainer that the author of “Suspicion” and “Rope” is our Tatyana Aleshicheva, Boris Glazerov, Anna Golovnya, Nick De Semlyn, Dan Jolin, Tamara Dondurei, Nikolai Karaev, Denis Korsakov, Maria Kuvshinova, Ivan Kulikov, Will Lawrence, Sergei Mezenov, Sergei Natapov, Ian Nathan, Kim Newman, Zaira Ozova, Nev Pierce, Alexey Prostyakov, Serafima Skibyuk, Adam Smith, Moore Soboleva, Vasily Stepanov, Alexander Strelkov, Ollie Richards, Oleg Tishchenkov, Alena Logunova, Chris Hewitt, Olga Shakina, the blonde Tsar Evelyn Salt, despite her brilliant track record, was suspected of spying for the Russians and decided what catch it no matter what.
Driven into a corner, she will paint herself the usual black and go looking for the truth herself.
Another action movie with Angelina Jolie in the role of a femme fatale promises to further strengthen the actress’s position in the action genre.
She will cause one accident after another, run along the walls a la “The Matrix” and, like children, scatter strong men in identical formal suits.
This is roughly how beauty should save the world.
Here he is, dear, who blew up and repaired the world with “The Fifth Element” and made Milla Jovovich the most beautiful woman in the universe.
Bruce Willis was the most superhero guy, and Gary Oldman was the most stylish and impeccable embodiment of Evil.
And at the same time, everything together turned out to be not a boring American-type blockbuster about the salvation of humanity, but a sweetest living carnival.
I don’t want to remember what Besson did for 13 years between “Element...” and “Adele...”.
To put it mildly, he didn’t sit idle, but all this script-producing fuss and rare, labored director’s performances will be forgotten.
But “Adele...” - hardly.
When you watch this movie, it seems that for 13 years in front of us it was not our Besson, but some kind of double.
And he, the real one, lived in a small apartment in Montmartre, drank wine in a cafe across the street and wrote a story about a charming adventurer.
Retelling the plot (even in general terms), raising expectations, in this case is more sinful than usual.
The incredible drive here lies in the fact that surprises await you around every turn or cue.
And all of them are pleasant.
Either a girl or a vision
THE EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURES OF ADELE
The most swashbuckling adventure movie of the decade hints that The Extraordinary Adventures of Adele will begin with Amelie, veer toward Jurassic Park, continue with Indiana Jones and The Mummy, and end with Titanic.
The film is based on the first volume of Jacques Tardy's comics about the journalist Adèle Blanc-Sec.
Louise Bourgoin appeared in only three films before Adele.
The actress became famous for her role in “The Girl from Monaco,” for which she was nominated for a Cesar Award.
The director does not run after the viewer with an outstretched hand, begging to appreciate the special effects, scenery or stunts, but carries him along, like an old-fashioned novelist exclaiming before a great journey to the center of the earth or to the ends of the world: “Forward, my reader, great things await us!”
At the same time, Besson treats genre cinema, about which he knows absolutely everything, unceremoniously and cheerfully, like a boy who has seen enough of old films and read a lot of Jules Verne.
Manipulating platitudes, not denying oneself cynicism and not being shy about taking risks
DIRECTOR Luc Besson
STARRING: Louise Bourguin, Mathieu Amalric, Frédéric Belle, Gilles Lelouch
PLOT: Strange things were happening in Paris in 1912.
The city was alarmed by an ancient monster, which was awakened to life by an old medium.
The police are chasing the fossil creature, as well as a famous hunter, a couple of scientists from the Natural History Museum and journalist Adele Blanc-Sec, who has a problem not so much with the animal itself, but with the medium - she needs to save her sister.
For the same purpose, the girl drags a real mummy from Egypt.
COMING OUT JULY 22
“Adele...” is the case when a parody becomes the pinnacle of the genre itself and is capable of radically changing it, sending it along a new path.
This was the case with the spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leone, with the gangster action films of Quentin Tarantino, with the aforementioned “Indiana Jones” (he was both bowed and ridiculed), and finally, with the same “The Fifth Element”.
Besson's style in this film consists of verbal trickery, acting clownery and plot balancing act (circus terms are quite appropriate - the unity of the two arts here is organic and stronger than ever).
A few words must be said about Adele herself.
She embodied the undeservedly forgotten type of adventurer who wins not so much through the exploitation of sexuality, but through sheer courage and courage.
In the movies, such girls, as a rule, are assigned some kind of macho man on duty or a hairy-eyed romantic
TEXT: ALEXANDER STRELKOV
Face to face with history
There is only a timid and comical admirer who only moves under his feet (only his knowledge of zoology turns out to be useful).
Therefore, the energetic girl does not waste time on amorous trifles, but has fun in the company of ancient corpses, which, by the way, play a key role in the plot.
Trained on numerous genre "cats" and, it seemed, completely sour, Luc Besson showed unexpected creative daring, recalling that the boundary between the preferences of bored mega-mall visitors and high-brow regulars of art-house halls is easily overcome by films for cheerful madmen.
Playing an adventure movie without sadness, fear and reproach
DEATH ROOM
A hermetic horror with a pretense of psychologism and political context. Jonathan Liebesman's debut horror film in 2002 was criticized by critics, but the public liked it and earned good money at the box office, and most importantly, it caught the eye of producer Michael Bay.
So the young director found himself in a factory forging new horrors using old patterns: Bay set out to remake all the horror classics in the form of remakes and commissioned Liebesman to prequel The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2006).
The critics grimaced again, but the public liked it again - Liebesman worked in the spirit of the “new scary” films, which emphasize the excessive physiological nature of violence.
In general, in his example one can observe how an entire genre is tossing around in convulsions, trying to invent new ways of influencing a jaded public: the naturalistic blood of splatters merges with the catch-up of slashers.
The plot is reminiscent of the Saw franchise, but without the gallons of blood.
Among the prototypes is Vincenzo Natali’s debut painting “Cube”. The film was no longer made by Michael Bay.
So in “The Death Room,” Liebesman was forced to take a different path: to stupid massacres or monotonous running from a maniac, he preferred a smarter option - almost without the notorious bloodshed, but with psychological games and riddles.
Evil doctors are playing cat and mouse with their experimental subjects.
And three men in a locked room are trying to develop a survival strategy: team up or shoot each other?
Play by the rules and obey orders from outside?
Or try to break your cage at any cost?
Not only they are tested, but also a young, ambitious intelligence officer, who is tested for ruthlessness by an experienced professor, skilled in wild experiments.
PLOT: For $250, four volunteers sign up for a simple test.
They are put in an isolated room and given each a stack of sheets with meaningless questions.
Then a polite man in a white coat enters the room, introduces himself as a doctor and shoots one of the subjects in the head.
A game of survival begins, with government agents closely watching behind the glass.
Too brooding for horror, but not enough for outright arthouse
He can make small talk and hit him in the face with a fire extinguisher, but he can’t miss a single skirt.
Charming Nastya, on the contrary, is cautious and adamant in her sympathies.
She is wounded by her father’s courtly lifestyle and openly spies on how he, as if parodying the famous scene from Paul Verhoeven’s “Showgirls,” dives into the pool for another romantic victim.
The daughter rebels, and the father tempts her young man from a poor family with money.
But the main theme of the family conflict is not the difference in generations or the choice of profession; it is, one way or another, already predetermined, but the girl’s unsuccessful attempts to refute the obvious idea that in modern Moscow everything is bought and sold.
The sluggish, melodramatic Mher Mkrtchan, together with Pavel Bardin, made the comedy “Three and a Snowflake” with Ivan Urgant.
Depardieu convincingly portrayed the father of his growing daughter in the comedy genre
The detailed plot meanders around the love affairs of the characters, who constantly talk about psychology, and themselves, apparently due to the director’s witty invention, focus on the language of gaze and gesture.
The secondary plot branches (the girl crippled in a car accident, whom Alexey wants to marry, the drunken athlete played by Sergei Gorobchenko), alas, are only outlined in dotted lines.
I especially feel sorry for the line about the business of repurchasing football players, which remained behind the scenes.
PLOT: More than anything else, an agent selling football stars is worried about the fate of his minor daughter Nastya.
The compassionate father himself changes women like expensive shirts, but his daughter is about to turn eighteen, and she must certainly marry a guy “with a core.”
Imagine the disappointment of the businessman when Nastya, in the struggle for independence and in defiance of her father, chooses his peer and business partner.
But with a potential slogan for the film’s audience, the author hit the mark: “Don’t look for a problem where there is none.” You can't say more precisely.
Their resemblance is simply amazing.
In both films there are squads of tough guys, soldiers of fortune, forced to take revenge on those who set them up, and in each company there is one beautiful girl.
The heroes gallop through almost the same parts of the world (both films begin in Latin America and end in the port of Los Angeles) and use the same spectacular shots - and here and there something stuffed with dollar bills explodes, and a whirlwind descends on the scenery from bucks.
Even the villains, dressed in expensive suits, are not easy to distinguish from each other (they are played in both cases by the Patricks - Jason Patric here, Patrick Wilson there).
Zoe Saldana's previous role was Neytiri in Avatar.
Sylvain White used to film about dance battles - “Brotherhood of Dance”.
Chris Evans was recently invited to play the hero of other comics: he will be Captain America.
Director Sylvain White was inspired by a comic book series that ran in the 70s and was rebooted in the 2000s, while Joe Carnahan was inspired by a comedy series from the 80s.
It’s simply amazing how they, without saying a word, brought different material to an absolutely identical thundering denominator, making rather heavy, predictable, unnecessary action films that evoke a lot of pictures with Willis and Schwarzenegger (comparisons invariably turn out to be in favor of Bruce and Arnold).
If we have to choose between these two films, then “Losers” looks a little prettier and is clearly poorer in terms of efficiency (after all, the budget is three and a half times less).
At least there's Zoe Saldana, who looks great on a bazooka.
STARRING: Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Zoe Saldana, Chris Evans, Patrick Wilson, Idris Elba, Columbus Short
PLOT: During an operation in the Bolivian jungle, a group of seasoned commandos working for the CIA were set up by their own superiors: a helicopter with children they were trying to save was blown up, and from that second the soldiers themselves were considered dead.
But they are alive - and they intend to take revenge at all costs on the scoundrel with a languid voice who set it all up.
All this is nice, but, frankly, it’s worth spending an hour and a half of your life on White’s painting only if you have absolutely no more interesting options.
Made from recycled materials, a relatively edible action movie
A simple story about an escaped Romanian convict
A Romanian low-budget film that won a prize at a prestigious international film festival.
In principle, having only this data in hand, one can vividly imagine the hypothetical content of the picture, and even some specific details of the form.
Without any doubt, the movie promises to be highly social.
Of course, it will be realistic, and tough at that.
There is a high probability of participation of non-professional actors.
Also in the film there will be a lot, a lot of Romanian poverty (yes, poverty knows no nationality, but Romanian, as our festival laureates prove from film to film, is especially poor).
Also, without knowing the year of release, you can easily mistake what is happening on the screen for the exercises of some underground critical realists from the Warsaw Pact countries, who were given a lecture about Bresson in the early 80s
The film received the Grand Jury Prize at the Berlin International Film Festival.
The script is based on a play by Andrea Valean, whose work is in particular demand among directors of the Romanian “new wave”.
Cinematographer Marius Panduru often works with Corneliu Porumboiu.
All of the above is true for the debut work of Florin Serban, and - don't get us wrong - is not at all abusive, but recommendatory in nature: the Romanian “new wave” is in that blissful stage of development when the faith of its representatives in the methods
her work has not yet wavered.
And this moment must be seized: only thanks to this faith can one endure the hour and a half spectacle of a Romanian juvenile colony and surrender to the charisma of the most talented Pisterianu (whose story, despite the abyss separating the two cultures, can easily be
convert into an exploitation a la 70s, with a cowboy who decides to take a walk from the prison, from where he will soon be leaving, to the nearest saloon).
STARRING: Georg Pistereanu, Ada Condeescu, Mihai Constantin, Clara Voda, Marian Bratu
PLOT: Having served his four years, 18-year-old prisoner Silviu (Pistereanu) is soon to be released, but suddenly finds out that his mother wants to take his younger brother with her to Italy.
From this moment on, the young man’s behavior becomes inadequate.
An affair with social worker Anna further pushes the guy to desperate actions, the meaning of which is summed up by the title of the film.
What nonsense all this is!
If you want to watch, watch.
Not a bad debut, inspiring a faint hope that a decent direction will someday emerge from the Romanian arthouse
Cartoon about the joys of villainy and family life
The directorial debut of a man named Coffin (Sop) and his co-author Reno was made under the auspices of producer Christopher Meledandri, the eminence grise of American animation, responsible, in particular, for all of Ice Ages, Horton and Robots.
“Despicable Me” is probably the best work of his team: the picture is beautifully drawn (by the way, it makes sense to watch it in 3D), especially if you like when different objects every now and then strive to jump out of the screen into the audience), passably written, and, The main thing is that there are not a single below-the-belt jokes, because of which during the “Ice Ages” you had to shyly squeeze into a chair and cover your children’s ears with your hands.
It is clear that the reason for the change of course was not the authors’ sense of proportion, but the blatant asexuality of the main character, which in turn was dictated by the reluctance to in any way touch on the topic of pedophilia.
The “adult” part here, in addition to the main conflict of single fatherhood, is responsible for a rather harsh black humor (which, we would like to think, we owe to director Coffin).
Overall, this is a very nice movie - so much so that at some point it even turns out to be too perfect and correct.
You can feel the painstaking work of a well-coordinated team of marketers who thought through every little detail so that the film would appeal to all categories of citizens.
It's not that we want to see children's cartoon characters eaten by cannibals or destroyed by an atomic explosion
PLOT: The big-nosed villain Gru, whose childhood dreams of space exploration have transformed over the years into the idea of stealing the Moon, is forced to resort to the help of children to carry out his great plan and eliminate his young rival.
In a certain advanced orphanage, he adopts three female orphans - Margot with glasses, Edith in a hat and Agnes, whose killer level of cuteness is comparable only to the cat from "Shrek".
As usually happens, children immediately transform the plans of adults.
The main character is based on Christopher Meledandri - both of them are bald, big-nosed and prone to dark humor.
In the original, the main characters were voiced by Steve Carrell and Jason Segel.
In the finale, Gru dances Travolta's part.
A car pulls up to an abandoned trailer somewhere in the middle of a virtual desert, from which emerge three pairs of the nicest tits.
Exactly.
The bearers of this gift themselves are not so significant.
The camera confidently captures this part of the body.
For connoisseurs, we immediately announce the good news - the entire film is in the same spirit.
Rick Jacobson understands the most correct things about female beauty and the casting was carried out in such a way that what happens on the screen is of secondary importance.
And a lot of funny things happen.
The “broker”, the “killer” and the “stripper” dig in the sand, douse themselves with water (don’t ask why), suffer some kind of blizzard and periodically fight absolutely fiercely.
The creators believe that a foul-mouthed chick with generous curves, smeared in mud, with a broken nose and shining white teeth is cool.
“Bitchy Things” is primarily focused on classic sexploitation films.
Rick Jacobson directed episodes of "Xena: Warrior Princess" and "The Wonderful Journeys of Hercules."
A similar film in the Moscow box office is “A Gun for Jennifer.”
It’s also cool when a bitchy beauty twists a bandit’s balls, a crazy punk fights together with a Japanese schoolgirl, this comes with a samurai sword and lesbian sex; and the intrigue unfolds through an endless number of flashbacks.
In general, for a film fetishist there is a real Klondike of pleasures here.
It is clear, of course, that Jacobson and his gang had a lot of fun while filming this trash parody, but the task itself seems rather strange.
If it were not for the physical qualities of the actresses, it would have become boring by the middle.
We can assume that this game came to us from a night channel for adults (Jacobson, by the way, often takes on serial episodes)
STARRING: Julia Voth, Erin Cummings, America Olivo, Michael Hurst, Ron Melendez
PLOT: Three dangerous beauties bring a mafia leader to the desert, who has diamonds worth a considerable amount hidden somewhere here.
Having achieved nothing and having shot the unfortunate bandit, the women begin to claw, fight with each other and thugs who periodically arrive from somewhere, and also regularly kiss and cuddle.
As things progress, it turns out that all three are not who they seemed to be at the beginning.
Apparently, according to the author, this is even funnier.
A product for a narrow circle of lovers of monstrous bad taste
Yes, with his latest film, Judgment Day, a debauched Mad Max for the underprivileged, Marshall misfired badly.
The bloodthirsty and biting peplum restores the director’s shaken confidence.
The new politically incorrect and moody magnum opus is not shy about its modest budget, obvious sources of inspiration and ferocious B-movie aesthetics.
The film contains both the hooligan courage of “Warrior Dogs” and the bestial cruelty of “The Descent.”
The “Marshall Plan” to cleanse the “peplum” of the adhering post-gladiatorial film dirt, on the whole, worked.
In 2011, Kevin MacDonald will present his interpretation of the history of the Ninth Legion.
His battle-scarred legionnaires (the unexpectedly colorful David Morrissey and Liam Cunningham, among others) are tough men trying to marry their military duty with an overwhelming desire to survive.
Murder and the piquant details of natural needs in ancient times are depicted here with love and thoroughness.
The scene of the extermination of the Ninth Legion, which took a lot of budget money, was directly inspired by the opening scene in the German forests from Sir Ridley Scott’s now reference “Gladiator,” but for some reason I absolutely don’t want to try to convict Marshall of plagiarism: he works honestly and without pretensions.
STARRING: Michael Fassbender, Olga Kurylenko, Dominic West, Liam Cunningham, David Morrissey
PLOT: The lands of modern Scotland, occupied by the Holy Roman Empire.
The remote outpost where centurion Quintus Diaz (Fassbender) serves is mercilessly destroyed by a Pictish reconnaissance company.
Diaz, who miraculously escaped, is forced to first join the notorious Ninth Legion, and then, with a bunch of other surviving Romans, try to elude a group of Pictish militants led by the sadistic Etain (Kurylenko).
The subtle arthouse artist has so far managed to win only sharp supporting roles in Hollywood, but I really want to believe that after “Centurion” the situation will change.
Peplum - revised and expanded edition.
Almost like "Gladiator", only more modest and harsher
Continuation of the story about schoolgirl Bella (Kristen Stewart) and her complex relationship with two extremely promising young men - the pale-faced vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and the werewolf bodybuilder Jacob (Taylor Lautner).
Pattinson's fans held their breath.
A large-scale film version of the animated series about a bald boy-sorcerer, called to bring peace to the four kingdoms.
The Lord of Fire started a bloody war and subjugated his neighbors.
Young Aang will be able to stop him only if he learns to control all the elements and becomes the Avatar.
Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) knows how to steal other people's thoughts and works tirelessly in the field of industrial espionage.
By penetrating the object's sleep, it forces the sleeping brain to work according to its own rules.
But this time he has to do the opposite - leave in one head what was not there.
A picturesque lesson on managing illusory worlds from Christopher Nolan.
An experienced wizard (Nicolas Cage) finds himself a young assistant in the hope of defeating an evil magician (Alfred Molina) together.
Using destructive spells, they will create bedlam in the middle of Manhattan with dragons and explosions.
Bald as a billiard ball, the kitty plotted to take over the whole world, and now the super-agent dogs are forced to join forces with their meowing antagonists.
The second series of a fluffy family comedy.
Several inveterate thugs, led by the frail-looking Royce (Adrien Brody), mysteriously end up on another planet, where they are hunted for sport by stylish fanged aliens.
The return of the iconic 80s character to the big screen.
Look out for George Clooney, who teams up with rock photographer-turned-director Anton Corbijn (Control) for a very interesting existential exploration of the psychology of an aging hitman hiding from people in a small Italian town and belatedly learning about human nature.
"A visionary artist of Corbijn's caliber and the magnificent George Clooney are a film match made in heaven," boasts a studio press release.
In addition, this project is another confirmation of the longest love relationship in Clooney’s life - with Italy: filming took place in the picturesque town of Castel del Monte in Abruzzo.
Taking the novel “A Very Secretive Gentleman” by Martin Booth as a basis, Rowan Joffe made some adjustments to his script: the place of the English narrator was taken by the American in the title, and from an illegal gunsmith the main character turned into a simple killer.
Otherwise, the story is close to the original: while the killer Jack is trying to deal with his latest case and finally give up his lucrative profession, his icy heart melts under the charm of a local priest (Paolo Bonacelli) and a street prostitute (Tekla Ruten), with whom Clooney’s character instantly falls in love.
“Jack tempts fate,” reads the official synopsis.
A dangerous messenger of darkness is approaching him closer and closer, and the mysterious lady who hires him may well not be the one she claims to be.”
Judging by the trailer, Corbijn's visual experiments, seasoned with Clooney's ashy hair (the film is similar to the long video 02), have reached a whole new level.
Daniel Radcliffe will star in the film adaptation of Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front
Can I shoot you with a photo gun!?
Johnny Depp could be seen in two places at once this season.
First, in Venice on the set of the thriller “The Tourist” by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck (“The Lives of Others”).
There he plays a tourist in love with Angelina Jolie's character.
Secondly, in Puerto Rico on the set of “The Rum Diary,” a film adaptation of the debut novel by the legendary Hunter S. Thompson.
The project is directed and written by Bruce Robinson (“Withnail and I”), whose last directorial work was the thriller “Jennifer 8” in 1992.
Looking at the work of the poster artists of the Russian prison drama, there is no doubt about what inspired them.
But you can’t approach the issue of implementing an idea literally!
However, at least the good thing is that the heroine of the Russian film, although alien, is not at all bald.
Director Dennis Dugan mainly specializes in projects with Adam Sandler.
They already have four joint projects: “Happy Gilmore”, “Big Daddy”, “Chuck and Larry: Fireman's Wedding”, “Don't Mess with Gohan!”
In July, the fifth comedy, Odnoklassniki, will be released, and the sixth is in the works, The Pretending Wife with Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman.
The schedule also includes a seventh film - the romantic comedy Jack and Jill, in which Sandler will simultaneously play Jack and his twin sister Jill.
Matthew Vaughn, who was remembered by viewers this year for the enchanting action film “Kick-Ass,” will reboot the X-Men.
The director first cast James McAvoy in the film X-Men: First Class, casting him in the role of the young Professor X.
Rosamund Pike will play mutant telepath Emma Frost, nicknamed the White Queen, Amber Heard will play the blue-skinned Mystique, and Michael Fassbender will presumably play Magneto.
While filming of the new Bond series is being postponed, its new director Sam Mendes is not bored.
On his to-do list is the musical Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and the film adaptation of Isan McCuse's novel On the Waterfront.
The script is adapted by the author himself.
Carey Mulligan has been offered the leading female role.
Gary Oldman is considering the role of the practical Major George Smiley - the main character of the series of novels by John Le Caré - in the film adaptation of the thriller Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.
The first adaptation of this work in 1979 starred Alec Guinness.
The new version will be directed by Danish director Thomas Alfredson, creator of the horror film Let Me In.
Tom Tykwer is adapting David Mitchell's bestselling science fiction novel Cloud Atlas.
According to the director, this is not easy (there are six parallel storylines in the novel), but extremely interesting work.
He has already received offers from Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, James McAvoy, Ian McKellen and Natalie Portman.
Filming of the international action film by Maxim Korostyshevsky under the working title “Soldiers of Fortune” is taking place in Crimea.
It is dedicated to millionaires who went to a real war with their money in search of adrenaline.
The cast includes Christian Slater, Sean Bean, Ving Rhames, Dominic Monaghan, Oksana Korostyshevskaya and others.
The film's premiere is scheduled for early 2011.
Sam Rockwell will star in the comedy Baby Jesus alongside English pop star Pixie Lotg
Megan Fox fired from Transformers 3
As the film company Ragatoipe assures, the dismissal “is not related to the interview in which Fox compared Michael Bay to Hitler.”
However, the place of the main character and new lover of the hero Shia LaBeouf will most likely be taken by the English model Rosie Huntington-Whitley.
The girl has no experience in cinema, so she will have to take crash courses in acting.
This fact should not frighten a sophisticated viewer - in the history of cinema there are many examples of successful retraining of models into actresses.
Charlize Theron (Monstro), Angelina Jolie (Girl, Interrupted), Jessica Lange (Blue Sky, Tootsie), Kim Basinger (LA Confidential), Jennifer Connelly (A Beautiful Mind), Geena Davis (“The Accidental Tourist”) and “First Runner-up USA ’86” Halle Berry (“Monster’s Ball”) started out as fashion models or posed for fashion magazines, eventually receiving a well-deserved Oscar.
They excelled in acting (also the beauties Milla Jovovich, Cameron Diaz, Monica Bellucci and, what is especially pleasant, our compatriot Olga Kurylenko.
High rewards are clearly at arm's length for them.
In a word, Rosie has someone to follow by example.
Valeria Gai Germanika, who deserved a Special Mention from the Cannes jury in 2008 for the film “Everyone Dies, But I Will Stay” and directed the scandalous television series “School,” received the position of creative director on the MT TV channel.
The channel's management believes that it is Valeria who will be able to bring the desired and necessary changes.
In particular, they are already planning to film their own series (about teenagers or about vampires).
Germanika also began casting new presenters.
The comedy “Kolotilov” directed by Leo Gabriadze and producer Timur Bekmambetov unexpectedly turned into “Freaks”.
The main theme of the film remains the same - provincial Russian language teacher Slava Kolotilov (Konstantin Khabensky) rushes to Moscow to visit his bride, but is delayed to coach a football team of street children.
The second storyline of the film received new development.
Instead of actress Elena Plaksina, the role of the capital's bride Nadya will be played by Milla Iovovich.
As an additional intrigue, a third will appear - Nadya’s ex-fiancé Danya (Ivan Urgant).
Thus, in addition to the question of whether the neighborhood team will win the football championship, the dilemma arises of who will get Milla Jovovich.
Due to constant delays in the filming of “The Hobbit” and the presence of a host of third-party projects, Guillermo del Toro abandoned the position of director.
The studios are trying to persuade producer Peter Jackson to take matters completely into his own hands, but he is only willing to agree to this step if absolutely necessary.
David Yates, who finished filming the Harry Potter saga, and Neill Blomkamp, whose film District 9, produced by Jackson, received an Oscar nomination, are named as possible successors.
The name of the new director will be officially announced at the next Sots-Sop convention at the end of July.
Angelina Jolie will play Cleopatra
Crazy from the tight schedule, critics and filmmakers rushed at super speed between the Sochi Winter Theater, where screenings with master classes were held, and the Pearl Hotel, where press conferences and round tables were streaming, barely having time to dive into the Black Sea.
The heroes of the competition films also behaved to match - in almost every one, someone was running somewhere: the confused Asians from Yusup Razykov’s “Guest Worker” and Dmitry Mamulia’s “Another Sky” were looking for their missing grandson and wife, the fugitive bandit from Yuri Bykov’s film “To Live”
The same cops were happily fooled by the hero of the detective Klim Shipenko “Who am I?” - which, however, was remembered by the public rather for the presence of a completely naked Zhanna Friske in the frame.
Heroes of domestic show business also appeared in a couple of competition films - in the film “Elephant” Sergei Shnurov played a truck driver transporting a circus animal to slaughter, and Evgeniy Grishkovets discussed his favorite topics - female betrayal, male loneliness, the healing power of alcohol - in a film production at two “Satisfaction”, where business partners challenged each other to an alcohol duel over a lady.
However, business events at Kinotavr also bore a noticeable imprint of the show - there was not a dull moment at any of them.
At a round table dedicated to the fate of the Russian arthouse, the chairman of the Russian Cinema Support Fund, Sergei Tolstikov, started a picturesque quarrel with critics: “Do you even read the articles in the press that I read?” - he menacingly asked those gathered.
“I write them,” President ERVEZS answered in confusion! Andrey Plakhov.
The scandals did not end there: towards the end of the festival, Alexey Fedorchenko’s film “Oatmeal” was suddenly removed from the competition program - it will go to Venice: the Mostra selectors decided that the extra Russian screening was a hindrance to them.
Previously, “Kinotavr” did not interfere with the giants - films from large festivals were shown in Sochi more than once: this time, for example, Sergei Loznitsa’s film “My Happiness” took part in the competition, competing with Mikhalkov and Virasethakun at the Azure Beret in the spring.
Nikita Sergeevich visited the film of a former Cannes competitor at Kinotavr and said that he liked it.
The chairman of the jury, Karen Shakhnazarov, on the contrary, did not like Loznitsa’s film at all - but under pressure from his colleagues, he was forced to give her a prize for directing.
The award for the best debut - "Missing" - was received by the daughter
A terrible film encyclopedia of Russian life: a naive, humane and rational hero is beaten, robbed and provoked to commit monstrous acts without any apparent purpose.
A precisely directed, cathartic film-experience, directed by a misanthrope with a mathematical background, which calls for only one thing - start thinking.
A debutant with a philosophical background, Mamulia names his films with quotes from Mamardashvili, avoids any events in the script and claims that the viewer’s joy lies in the labor of comprehending his inaccessible meditative films.
The most complex film from Kinotavr has already been selected for the Karlovy Vary competition - the director's star is born.
Impeccably dressed and haircut, programmer Leonid reacts to the world with restrained disgust, hiding in the hole of a neat bachelor's life.
But a cast-iron woman descends on the house, the unjust hand of the punitive authorities falls on the hero’s head, and he begins a senseless run through Kafkaesque spaces and situations.
“Sometimes it’s useful to work not only with debutants,” producer Sabina Eremeeva triumphantly declared from the stage, taking the prize.
Critics thought differently: in their opinion, Sabina simply managed to bring out the “inner debutant” from the luminary of Russian art cinema.
And this is symptomatic - today in our cinema the bison are following the youth.
It's not the other way around.
A documentary film shot in such a way that it blows your mind away even more than a similar feature film.
The author is interested in both the screwdriver examining the electric meter and the piece of unsalted butter drifting across the cast-iron frying pan - all this turns the story of an unemployed miner, his thin-toothed lover and her criminal brother into a real oil painting.
The winner of the short film competition, Nikolai Sokolov, applies the black and white style of the French New Wave to the world of residential areas.
Even though Godard’s editing moves in the story about two schoolchildren, one of whom dreams of making a bomb, and the other of whom wants to play Bach backwards, look strange, but thank you for a rare attempt to poeticize the surrounding reality.
“Three times a year - on the eve of Victory Day, Russia Day and City Day - about ten aircraft of the An-12, Il-18, An-32, An-24 types, equipped for the duration of the work with meteorological equipment and technical means of influence, take to the skies on clouds and loaded with special environmentally friendly chemicals - liquid nitrogen, granulated carbon dioxide (“dry ice”), meteorological squibs with silver iodide and powdered reagents.
The process is as follows: airplanes at a distance of 50-100 kilometers from Moscow (depending on the length and power of the rain front) “break” clouds heading towards the city with these reagents. Particles of substances condense moisture around them.
As a result, precipitation occurs earlier than planned, and in the exact location where the impact on the cloud occurred.”
For ten years now, work has been underway on a remake of the sci-fi film, in which Michael York played the main role.
Carl Rinsch, who became famous for his commercials, was recently appointed director (he already has a remake of “Creature from the Black Lagoon” on his schedule).
Previously, the names of Bryan Singer (X-Men), James McTeigue (V for Vendetta) and Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy) were associated with the project.
In the story, the hero, who is thirty years old, is forced to flee from a death sentence, since the society of the future executes all citizens upon reaching this age.
Robert Rodriguez has acquired the rights to the 1980s rotoscoped fantasy film and plans to turn it into a big movie.
The original was the fruit of the joint work of director Ralph Bakshi (film "The Lord of the Rings", 1976) and fantasy artist Frank Frazzetta.
The theme of the cartoon was swords, magic and a lot of drawn boobs.
In it, the warrior Larn saves Princess Tigra and all the people from the evil lord of the ice, Nekron.
Rodriguez promises to carefully consider the creation of non-humans and barbarians on pterodactyls.
George A. Romero will be putting his zombies on vacation for the near future as he himself plans to tackle a remake of Dario Argento's giallo classic.
The heroes will be brought back to the big screen by none other than Michael Bay, the master of action, explosions and horror remakes.
The remake will be directed by Daming Chen, who will also adapt the script.
Argento and Romero previously collaborated on Day of the Dead and filmed 2 Evil Eyes together in 1990.
This time Dario is not directly involved in the project, but his brother Claudio is producing the film and writing the script for it.
Jennifer Garner and Nick Nolte join Russell Brand and Helen Mirren in 'Arthur' remake
“I wanted to bring more strength to the female character to reflect the state of things in China,” says Chen.
— Chinese women nowadays run big businesses and win Olympic gold.
Gong Li embodies this strength."
For the second time in a row you play an imaginary character.
It is an accident?
Pattern.
I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I was presenting two films here (at Kinotavr and the Sochi Film Market - EMRBE).
And in both I play a dream woman.
But... this is how the director saw me, this is how he introduced me, and many probably think that this is how I am in life.
Dream girl.
Your co-star in the film, Alexander Yatsenko, is completely different from his hero.
How did you find common ground? What is he like on the court?
He is absolutely not what he seems at first glance.
At first I saw him and thought: “Yes... I’m not just going to have to.”
Probably, without human contact, sincere and real, we would not have succeeded.
And we had this contact literally a few minutes after we met.
We’ve become great friends, I’m not afraid of this word.
I told him about all my fears, about all my experiences, that I was afraid that I wouldn’t succeed, and asked him for some advice and help, and he gladly gave me this advice and this help.
We talked a lot...
I tried to do this because I was very afraid of losing this contact, of losing our mutual understanding.
And so at the premiere we watched the entire film holding hands.
How was filming in Sevastopol?
Sevastopol is the city I came to for the first time.
I have never toured there, I never went there on vacation, or as a child.
This city has a special magic, its own character, its own charisma.
And this is a city that you want to return to.
It has its own provincial charm.
A place where no one is in a hurry and always has time everywhere.
It turns out that it was not difficult for you to play falling in love with this city.
In general, you are extremely organic on screen, which many, frankly speaking, did not expect.
How do you work with roles?
Do you find emotional scenes easy?
You know, I'm not a professional actor.
And I am a very trusting person by nature.
If I came and agreed to work with a director, then I, in fact, entrust myself into his hands and I want to be the dough from which they will mold.
I understand perfectly well that it is clearer from the outside, and I, again, ask for tips and talk with the director for a very long time, it’s not even me who talks to him, but he conducts preliminary conversations with me and explains very clearly and precisely what he needs.
And then, through long, many-hour rehearsals, we arrive at the organics you are talking about.
How was it like working with the director of the film, Klim Shipenko?
I enjoyed everyone, the cameraman, director, producer, Sasha Yatsenko.
Because I enjoy working with crazy people!
I saw the same thing when I worked with Timur Bekmambetov.
He was ready not to sleep, not to eat - and here was exactly the same situation.
Don't sleep, don't eat for days - and it doesn't matter, even thunder or hail.
And if something didn’t work out, it was a disaster, and something urgently needed to be done to make it work.
It is very easy to work in this atmosphere of madness.
And it seems to me that when people are so driven to the point of morbid fanaticism in what they do, it cannot fail, because too much energy is expended.
What scripts are you turning down?
What are the criteria for selecting the material with which you will work?
I don't want nonsense, stupid dialogues, films that say nothing, convey nothing.
I don’t want to work just to appear on the screen one more time.
Do you have any proposals, projects that you are going to work on in the near future?
There are no specific proposals or plans at the moment.
I'm not the kind of person who writes schedules.
The script arrived, I was interested in it, and today the premiere happened.

Report from the set of Tony Scott's new thriller, in which Denzel Washington saves the world again
GLASNOST BOOTH
While we are working on the November issue, film festivals are going on in Moscow almost continuously: American cinema - “Amfest”, “2toggo\”, “2-t-1” will begin the other day, followed by the British film festival.
And here’s what’s interesting: half of my acquaintances constantly discuss the need to boycott someone and support someone, for some - well, excuse me - very vague reasons.
At the same time, when one of these festivals is solemnly closed with a terrifying-looking Chu4 projection without English subtitles, no one seems to notice anything.
The last thing you want is to grumble about this, but if you, having bought a ticket for money, remain in the hall looking at the giant pixels and horizontal figures of the actors, then they will show them to you.
Meanwhile, in our room there are no pixels: “Tron: Legacy” (a continuation of the classic film about virtual reality), “Let me in. Saga (an American remake of the excellent Swedish film), Uncontrollable (another Tony Scott take on the train theme) and a wildly detailed account of how the Conan, the Barbarian, the Destroyer and the Governor films were made.

GUESS WHERE THE QUOTE ON THE SPINE OF THE MAGAZINE COMES FROM.
AS A GIFT FOR THE FIRST THREE READERS TO ANSWER CORRECTLY - AN ANNUAL SUBSCRIPTION AND OOO FROM THE COLLECTION
The multi-part fairy tale about a handsome bespectacled sorcerer is nearing its end.
And even though fans of the series have read the book a long time ago and know how it will end, and those to whom the word “Expelliarmus” means nothing will remain at home, the title of the main blockbuster of November is actually reserved for Harry.
By the way, the studios are no fools either: in order to extend the audience’s pleasure and finally get the most out of the franchise, they decided to split the seventh film into two parts.
So the sentimental farewell to the magical world of Hogwarts will last until next summer.
SOCIAL NETWORK
History of the creation of the Facebook network
David Fincher's new film is, first and foremost, a story about paradox.
The film tells the story of the invention of Facebook, one of the pioneering tools in the Internet, which united the whole world, quarreled five friends and made its creator, 26-year-old former Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, the youngest billionaire of recent decades.
Jesse Eisenberg in the title role is as great as our conflicted genius, an emotionally isolated social outcast with an unpredictable set of motivations and loyalties.
Zuckerberg starts the site for a variety of reasons: partly out of anger at the world around him, partly out of sport, and partly just because IT'S "cool."
The idea itself and its implementation may seem spontaneous and spontaneous, but the actual course of events hints at a clear calculation and a well-thought-out business plan.
The strengths of The Social Network are evident from the very first frames, especially in the pre-credits scene where Zuckerberg talks to his five-minute ex-girlfriend Erica (Mara) in a bar: screenwriter Aaron Sorkin's sonorous, tough dialogue gains strength from here and do not soften until the very end.
It’s the same with Fincher’s direction: relatively restrained (with the exception of the Winklevoss Twins, the actors played them were dissimilar to each other.
The face of one of them was superimposed on the other using computer graphics.
Natalie Portman studied at Harvard at the same time as Zuckerberg.
Rooney Mara has landed the lead role in Fincher's next film, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
DIRECTOR David Fincher
STARRING: Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Rooney Mara, Justin Timberlake, Armie Hammer, Joshua Pence
PLOT: Gloomy and withdrawn Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, having received a turnaround on the personal front, takes on the ambitious task of creating a fundamentally new social network.
As Facebook grows in popularity, relationships with the few fellow friends begin to fall apart and eventually lead to lawsuits.
The color palette plays its part: warm, sunny in places, remaining cozy even in the dark, it maneuvers between two tangled chains of events and two isolated legal battles.
Not much happens outside the flow of ongoing discussion in the film: not a single death, not a single murder, and all of Zuckerberg's legal troubles are unlikely to warrant at least an extra paragraph for his meager Wikipedia page.
What attracted 49-year-old Sorkin and 48-year-old Fincher to this not-too-detailed story?
After watching, there is a strong feeling that “The Social Network” is a portrait of our time, and understatement in this case is an important artistic device.
Just twenty years ago, Wall Street was doing roughly the same thing, only on a larger scale - with cosmic egos and big deals.
Now that daily solvency has become even higher, politics is no longer carried out at board meetings, but in sandboxes.
Zuckerberg wants to be special, dreams of becoming the center of attention.
Severin (Garfield) is hurt because his best friend has a new best friend (Timberlake) and now he has no one to play with.
The Winklevosses (Hammer and Pence), meanwhile, stomp their feet: who said that rich, beautiful and athletic can't also be smart?
(This line particularly amuses Fincher.)
If desired, The Social Network could very well turn out to be a black comedy.
Zuckerberg is obsessed with the idea of popularity and leadership, but what is more in his business - positive or negative?
And what social consequences will its invention entail?
Is he a swindler?
Or a cunning manipulator?
Fincher and Sorkin will never close the book if there is even the slightest hint of something like that.
But it won't even be necessary here: in their version of history it doesn't matter at all.
“What does it feel like to feel beautiful?” - asks in Tre VeaNez's song “WaBu Wots'te A Vsp Map”, which precedes the credits.
The hero doesn't know.
The film suggests the answer.
Zuckerberg is a member of the lost online generation, which has little idea of beauty and even less of feelings.
A tasteful character drama about a high-profile Internet-era trial
At the beginning of the 17th century, when Ivan Susanin lived, surnames for people of humble origin had not yet really begun to appear.
They made do with the name “such and such, such and such son.”
That is, patronyms were in use - nicknames after the father.
But sometimes, for example, in the case of remarriages of the father, a matronym was used - a nickname after the mother's name.
Susanin is just such a case: “Ivan, son of Susanna.”
Serfs of small landowners really did without surnames for a long time - why have them when you have 20 souls and everything is constantly in sight.
But the owners of estates worth thousands were forced to give their peasants surnames.
Thus, the serfs of Prince Andrei Cherkassky already at the beginning of the 18th century. Everyone had last names.
In the 19th century Even small landowners did not keep the peasant on the land, but let him go on quitrent - let him earn money by craft and pay the owner.
Such a peasant was entitled to a passport, where his last name had to be entered.
By the abolition of serfdom in Central Russia, 55% of serfs were released on quitrent.
This means they already had surnames.
Capital forensic experts arrived to investigate the explosion in Novosibirsk
Criminologists from the central office and employees of the forensic center arrived in Novosibirsk to help with the investigation into the case of a gas explosion in a house on Lineinaya, 39, NGS reports.
According to investigators, the accused, Irina Urbakh and Evgeniy Kavun, posing as employees of the fictitious organization Mezhregiongaz, examined and repaired gas equipment.
They used low-quality spare parts, did not work carefully, and, on the contrary, inflated the prices for their services, the agency reports, citing an informed source.
On the eve of the tragedy on Lineinaya, a man and a woman visited three apartments in building No. 39, where they changed hoses for stoves.
So, in one of the apartments they installed a water hose instead of a gas hose.
Kavun, however, denies this.
According to him, this is impossible, everything was certified.
As a result of their actions, a leak and explosion of the gas-air mixture occurred in one of the apartments.
Two entrances collapsed - one completely, the second partially.
This led to a significant collapse of the building, killing 13 people.
Earlier, suspects were arrested in connection with a house explosion in Novosibirsk.
The scammers themselves came from Omsk.
Marine surge flooding was avoided in St. Petersburg
Arguments of the Week.
St. Petersburg → Society

Experts were able to prevent the flood by closing the dam the day before.
On Friday, the threat of flooding in St. Petersburg increased sharply due to bad weather in the city.
Marine surge flooding was prevented due to the timely closure of the dam.
The potential flood could be the 32nd in a row, reports the St. Petersburg publication Neva.Today.
The water level reached 184 centimeters, but thanks to the closure of the gates in the Gulf of Finland, the water remained at 168 centimeters, which is only seven centimeters higher than the lower threshold of the dangerous flood level (from 161 to 210 centimeters).
Weather conditions were complicated by gusty winds, the speed of which at times reached 20-25 meters per second.
Now the dam has been opened again, the water level has dropped, and ships can sail in the Gulf of Finland again.
Note that the water level situation is monitored by ten meteorological stations on the eastern side of the Gulf of Finland.
This helps prevent flooding that may result from increased winds.
In Turkey, 8 people were arrested in connection with deficiencies in collapsed buildings.
In the Turkish province of Sanliurfa, 8 people were arrested in connection with construction defects discovered in buildings that collapsed as a result of the earthquake.
As Armenpress reports, this was reported by Habertürk.
As a result of the earthquake registered in Turkey on February 6, more than 20 thousand people died.
The number of wounded exceeds 80 thousand.
It is noted that the earthquake is the strongest since 1939.
The 7.7 magnitude earthquake was followed by hundreds of tremors, which were felt not only in 10 provinces of Turkey, but also in neighboring Syria.
Pashinyan sent congratulatory messages to the Supreme Leader of Iran and the President of the country
Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan sent congratulatory messages to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Seyyed Ali Khamenei, and the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ebrahim Raisi, on the occasion of the 44th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.
Armenpress was informed about this by the Department of Information and Public Relations of the Office of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia.
The message to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution of Iran, Seyyed Ali Khamenei, says:
"Your Eminence,
I cordially congratulate you on the 44th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution.
Armenian-Iranian warm and friendly relations with centuries-old roots, rich history and traditions are of particular importance for our two countries.
More than three decades have passed since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Republic of Armenia and the Islamic Republic of Iran, and we are witnessing strong and stable bilateral cooperation.
I am confident that the Armenian-Iranian friendly relations, tempered in an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust, will have even greater achievements in the future for the benefit of the peoples of Armenia and Iran.
Taking this opportunity, I wish you good health and many years of life."
The congratulatory message sent to Ebrahim Raisi reads, in part: “Your Excellency, accept heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to you and the friendly people of Iran on the occasion of the 44th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution.
The unbreakable Armenian-Iranian relations, based on centuries-old history and mutual respect, are of particular importance for the Republic of Armenia.
I am confident that as a result of joint efforts, we will be able to bring interstate cooperation to a new level, the multi-sectoral agenda of which will be further expanded for the benefit of the well-being of our two friendly peoples and the security of our countries.
Emphasizing the importance of our ideas regarding the establishment and strengthening of regional peace and stability, I confirm the official invitation addressed to you during my visit to Tehran last year to visit Armenia.
Taking this opportunity, I wish you new achievements and stable peace to the friendly people of Iran."

Video caption: WW2 bomb explosion in Great Yarmouth is caught on camera
In England, in the port city of Great Yarmouth, a World War II-era bomb exploded on Friday as sappers tried to defuse it.
The powerful explosion was heard tens of kilometers away, but there were no casualties.
Norfolk County Police announced that although the explosion was unplanned, no one from the military involved in defusing the bomb was injured.
“The device detonated shortly after work began to disarm it.
Fortunately, all personnel are intact.
Agencies have begun assessing the damage," Norfolk Police Assistant Chief Nick Davison told reporters.
Local residents write on social networks that the explosion shook houses at a distance of 24 km.

Photo caption: The explosion occurred contrary to the plans of the sappers, but there were no killed or wounded
The 250kg bomb was found during construction work on the banks of the River Yar, at the mouth of which Great Yarmouth stands on the North Sea.
Before attempting to defuse the bomb, sappers built a protective rampart of sand around it, and a cordon was placed at a distance of 200 meters to prevent outsiders from entering.
At first, back on Thursday, explosives experts were going to use a robot to cut the fuse off the bomb, but the attempt failed, and then they decided, as the local press writes, to use the technique of “slow burning” the explosives.
During this burning process an explosion occurred.
During World War II, the Nazis dropped hundreds of thousands of bombs on Britain.
During the eight-month intensive bombing campaign from the autumn of 1940 to the spring of 1941, known as the Blitz, 450,000 bombs were dropped on Britain alone.
Almost 40% of Belarusian researchers are women
In Belarus, the number of women among researchers is 38.9%, Alesya Solovey, a researcher at the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences, told BELTA.
The share of women among candidates of science and doctors of science is also growing: among candidates of science, women make up 41.1%, among doctors of science - 21%.
In all fields of science, with the exception of technical ones, the share of women exceeded 50%.
The most feminized area of scientific knowledge is medical sciences, in which the share of women is 64.4%.
Only in technical sciences are men predominant, women make up 26.7%.
At the National Academy of Sciences, the share of women among researchers is 49.1% - this is more than in the republic as a whole, by 10.2%.
Among candidates of sciences, the proportion of women is 46%, among doctors of sciences - 20%.
Among the teaching staff in higher education institutions, more than half are women (57%).
Among vice-rectors for scientific, educational and educational work, every third is a woman (31.8%), among deans - 38.7%, deputy deans - 44.6%, heads of departments - 42.5%.
The majority of women are among senior lecturers and lecturers - over 60%.
The proportion of women is also high among associate professors in departments (55.2%).
According to republican public opinion monitoring conducted by the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences last year, the majority of Belarusians do not support gender stereotypes about the capabilities of women in science.
63.5% (56.5% of men and 69% of women) disagree with the gender stereotype “science is a male field of activity” to one degree or another.
More than half of the country's residents are not of the opinion that women are less competent as scientists - 66.1% (59% of men and 71.6% of women).
“The transformation in the mass consciousness of gender ideas about the research competence of women contributes to the attraction of young women into science, the development of their creative potential, the formation of a successful role model of a female scientist, including through the transfer of experience and the institution of mentoring,” noted Alesya Solovey.
The International Day of Women and Girls in Science is celebrated annually on February 11th.
The holiday was established to introduce women and girls to the field of science, encourage women to develop scientific careers and recognize the achievements of women in science.
According to UNESCO, women make up 30% of the total number of researchers in the world. -0-
The likelihood of a future increase in the key rate is higher than its reduction
This statement was made by the Chairman of the Bank of Russia, Elvira Nabiullina, following a meeting of its Board of Directors on February 10, which decided to maintain this rate at 7.50%.
The head of the regulator, in particular, noted that important changes have taken place recently.
On the one hand, foreign trade conditions have noticeably worsened - prices for Russian oil have fallen.
On the other hand, the economic situation is developing better than the October forecast.
The shift in the structure of demand continues: consumption remains subdued, private investment is slowing, but fiscal spending is rising.
At the same time, pro-inflationary risks have generally increased.
“Therefore, this year the likelihood of a rate increase exceeds the likelihood of its reduction.
The advisability of changing the rate will be determined by the development of the situation,” said E. Nabiullina.
In addition to the more pronounced impact of fiscal policy, she noted three risks.
Firstly, the rapid expansion of consumption in the context of elevated inflation expectations, if the factors that restrain consumer activity weaken.
Secondly, there is an increasing shortage of labor and labor productivity growth lagging behind wage growth.
And there are still risks of additional tightening of sanctions restrictions.
Speaking about the regulator's future decisions, the Chairman of the Bank of Russia noted that, despite the previously noted strengthening of pro-inflationary factors, the inflation forecast for the current year remains at the level of 5 - 7%.
According to her, this may require a higher trajectory of the key rate than expected in October.
In the updated Central Bank forecast for this and next year, the ranges for the average key rate are increased by half a percentage point, to 7.0-9.0% per annum for 2023 and 6.5-7.5% per annum for 2024.
“This does not exclude the possibility of a rate cut this year, but its likelihood and scale have decreased.
On the contrary, the likelihood has increased that a slight increase in the rate may be necessary in order for inflation to meet the target of around 4% in 2024,” concluded the head of the Bank of Russia.
The Bank of Russia has approved the requirements for the procedure for creating special closed-end mutual investment funds (MUIFs) consisting of blocked foreign securities.
The regulator informs that such securities will be removed from existing retail mutual funds.
This will allow the management of the remaining liquid assets to begin and operations with investment units to resume.
If a retail mutual fund contains more than 10% of blocked securities, then the management company must allocate them to a separate closed mutual fund before September 1, 2023.
Each shareholder will be issued shares of the new fund in an amount equal to the shares of the main fund.
It is also possible to change the status of a retail fund to a closed fund.
For funds with a share of blocked securities of less than 10%, the new requirements are not mandatory.
But the management company has the right to allocate blocked assets into a separate closed mutual fund.
In addition, a requirement is being introduced to inform shareholders about the consequences of withdrawing blocked securities to a special mutual fund.
In the future, in the event of the sale of such securities, management companies are obliged to pay quarterly to the owners of investment shares at least 90% of the proceeds, the Bank of Russia said in a statement.
In addition to summing up the industry, experts also gave a forecast for the current year.
According to the Center for Analytics and Expertise of Promsvyazbank, in 2022 in Russia, air transport passenger turnover decreased by 6.3%, and passenger transportation by 14.2%.
The volume of passenger traffic amounted to 95.2 million people, and passenger turnover - 228.0 billion passenger-kilometers.
International passenger transportation amounted to 17.2 million people, which is 26.7% lower than the previous year, domestic transportation - 78.0 million people (-10.9%).
PSB analysts note that the relative stability of the industry was influenced by government support programs.
In 2022, there was a program to stimulate domestic tourism, for which 38.8 billion rubles were allocated.
Tourists could receive a partial refund for tours with flights prepared by Rostourism.
Also, to ensure the accessibility of air transportation, several government support programs were implemented, including subsidizing the transportation of citizens, developing regional transportation, etc. with a total budget of more than 27.5 billion rubles.
In the second quarter of 2022, the government decided to allocate an additional 100 billion rubles to airlines. and recapitalize Aeroflot by 52.5 billion rubles.
“Despite the sanction pressure on the Russian aviation industry, as a result of the development of domestic tourism and the opening of new international destinations, as well as the continued subsidization of the industry by the state (25.3 billion rubles have been allocated so far), in 2023, passenger traffic, according to our estimates, will increase by 6 .4%, up to 101.2 million people (domestic passenger traffic will be 91.1 million people), according to the forecast of the Federal Air Transport Agency, up to 103.0 million people,” PSB analysts share their forecasts.
Terrorist attack in Jerusalem, 6-year-old child killed
Two people, including a 6-year-old child, were victims of a terrorist attack in Jerusalem: a car crashed into a bus stop at high speed.
Six more people were injured.
The driver of the car was shot dead on the spot.
It was later revealed that he was a 31-year-old Palestinian from East Jerusalem.
Law enforcement agencies classified his actions as a terrorist attack, the terrorist’s relatives were detained, and the house was sealed.
At the same time, according to Israeli media reports, the attacker had mental problems and was only released from the hospital this week.
Austria is again tightening controls on its border with Hungary after another influx of migrants in recent months.
Officials say many people remain in cars at the border waiting to cross into the Austrian side.
Thus, this becomes a signal to the Austrian authorities that they have already completed the asylum procedure in Hungary.
Based on existing arrangements, Austria believes that migrants are obliged to remain in the country where the request was made.
At the same time, the Austrian authorities consider it wrong to automatically send back to Hungary those wishing to cross the border: many migrants become victims of smugglers and find themselves between two border posts without the right to return to Hungary.
That is why, according to the police, increased control is required.
Vienna's decision to tighten checks follows a pledge by European Union leaders to spend more money on cameras, drones and watchtowers to protect the commonwealth's borders.
According to the Frontex agency, last year the number of illegal migrants who arrived in the EU and requested refugee status for the first time exceeded the figures for 2016 and amounted to more than 330 thousand.
Cargo Progress 83 successfully docked to the ISS
The automated resupply ship Progress 83 successfully docked with the International Space Station at 3.45 GMT on Saturday, completing a two-day orbital flight.
The docking took place at an altitude of 269 statute miles above the South Pacific Ocean.
The docking was broadcast by NASA's Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas.
In Russia, the docking was controlled by specialists from the Mission Control Center.
The cargo ship was greeted from the ISS by cosmonauts Sergei Prokopyev, Dmitry Petelin and Anna Kikina.
The Progress MS-22 spacecraft delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS, including 720 kg of refueling fuel, 420 kg of water, as well as about 1,354 kg of dry cargo.
In addition, the ship delivered food for Russian cosmonauts.
Progress 83 successfully launched from the Russian Baikonur Cosmodrome on Thursday.
At the same time, Roscosmos reported the depressurization of Progress MS-21, which was prepared for undocking from the ISS and further flooding on February 18.
As the company's press service clarified, the spacecraft's transfer hatch was immediately closed: Progress MS-21 is isolated from the general volume of the ISS.
The reasons for its depressurization are being clarified."
The MCC also reported that the ISS crew is not in danger: “The temperature and pressure on board the station are normal.
There is no threat to the life and health of the crew, they are feeling good."
“Instances of maternity tourism have become more frequent.”
How pregnant Russians got stuck in Argentina
The Argentine Migration Service began to suspend and cancel the residence permit of Russians who received it through the birth of a child, but did not remain to live in the country.
Previously, the republic’s authorities denied entry into the country to several pregnant Russian women who were suspected of arriving for the purpose of “maternity tourism.”
On February 11, they were nevertheless allowed into Argentina by court decision.
Read more in the article "Gazeta.Ru".
The Argentine Migration Service began to suspend and cancel the residence permit (residence permit) of Russians who received it through the birth of a child, but did not remain to live in the country.
Service director Florencia Carignano told C5N TV channel about this.
“What we are doing is suspending the residence permits of those Russians who came to get a residence permit because their child is Argentinean, but at the same time spent more time outside (Argentina) than inside (the country),” she explained she.
According to her, when the court considers the issue of Argentine citizenship for a Russian, the migration service will submit information that the residence permit was suspended because this person “spent a month in Argentina and never came again.”
Carignano warned that Russians who received a residence permit after the birth of a child and left could have it revoked.
Against this background, on February 9 it became known that three pregnant Russian women were “stuck” at the airport in Argentina due to being denied entry into the country.
According to the head of the consular department of the Russian Embassy in Argentina, Georgy Polin, the diplomatic mission associates the incident with the fact that the authorities of the republic could consider the information provided by the girls upon entry to be incomplete or false.
One of them arrived on February 7, and two more on the evening of February 8, RIA Novosti reports.
The diplomat emphasized that more pregnant women flew to Argentina, but these three in particular were issued an order not to enter the country.
“They were not allowed into the country in accordance with the migration law, where one of the grounds for not allowing them into the country is the provision of incomplete, false, distorted information,” said Polin.
On Saturday, February 11, the Argentine migration service, by court decision, allowed pregnant Russian citizens to enter the country, said lawyer Christian Rubilar.
“An hour ago they were all allowed to enter Argentina,” TASS quoted him as saying.
Rubilar noted that the migration service changed its decision after the court ruling.
It is easier for foreign parents of a child born in Argentina to obtain a passport of the republic.
It allows you to make short-term trips to 171 countries without visas, including EU countries, the UK and Japan, RBC notes.
At the beginning of January 2023, The Guardian newspaper wrote about a “boom in maternity tourism” to Argentina among Russians.
According to Polin, in 2022, from 2 thousand to 2.5 thousand Russian citizens moved to the republic.
Many of them, the diplomat noted, are Russian women planning to give birth there.
“In 2023, this number could grow to 10 thousand,” he said.
In turn, Carignano previously claimed that about 10.5 thousand Russian citizens arrived in Argentina in 2022, and more than 5.8 thousand pregnant women in recent months.
On February 9, it became known how rental prices in St. Petersburg have changed.
It fell in price by 10%.
At the same time, it is known that throughout the country rent has become 25% more expensive, reports Patrolman of St. Petersburg with reference to RBC.
The average monthly rent for an apartment in St. Petersburg at the beginning of 2023 was 27,000 rubles.
A one-room apartment cost 25,000 rubles per month, a studio - 22,000 rubles per month, a two-room apartment - 36,000 rubles per month.
Experts believe that this trend may change by the spring, when many citizens who have been abroad return home.
The reasons for interrogating women in a foreign country have become known.
The Argentine Migration Service did not allow six pregnant Russian women into the country, since the purpose of the visit, which was indicated by them, turned out to be false.
TASS reports this with reference to the Todo Noticias TV channel.
Over the course of five hours, pregnant women were asked questions about the purpose of the visit.
Most of them admitted that they had come to a foreign country to give birth.
In this regard, representatives of the country did not allow Russian women to enter Argentina.
As specified in the publication, the migration service has a procedure for action if there are suspicions of “false” travelers.
So, if it is noticeable that a woman is in the 33rd week of pregnancy, she does not have a return ticket to Russia, and she cannot clearly talk about where she will go on vacation, then suspicions from the migration service immediately fall on her.
Moreover, experts clarify that it is difficult to be a traveler “in such conditions.”
The artist’s decision to leave the theater was planned.
Laureate of the State Prize of the Russian Federation, Alexander Filippenko, stated that the decision of the Mossovet Theater not to renew the contract with him was planned, in addition, everything was agreed upon in advance with the management.
He spoke about this in an interview with Interfax.
Invite artists from the second cast to the productions in which he took part.
The People's Artist of the Russian Federation clarified that his contract expired in 2022.
All details have long been agreed upon with representatives of the theater.
Moreover, everyone knew that the star was not going to renew his contract.
Filippenko noted that the management agreed to the meeting and prepared all the documents.
So, he assures that he “didn’t let anyone down.”
In addition, it became known that the artist emigrated from Russia.
He flew to his heiress in Latvia.
Filippenko is going to undergo “long-term treatment” in a foreign country.
As the publication says, today the film actor works in the Moscow theater as a guest actor.
According to the publication, the artist played in the Moscow City Council in such performances as Shakespeare Hamlet and The Taming of the Shrew, Uncle Vanya, and Three Sisters.
On Friday, February 10, 340 thousand cubic meters of snow were removed from the private sector territories in the Kalinin Autonomous Okrug.
This information was shared at the city hall.
At the moment, in the Kalininsky district there are more than four hundred private streets from which snow must be removed by spring.
The roads will be cleared in two stages.
The first will end on the fifteenth of February, and the second will take place from the first of March to the fifteenth of April.
114 units of special equipment and 123 workers will take part in the cleaning.
Authorities reported that contractors are faced with snow being blown onto the roadway by residents of their homes.
Kirkorov won the case against the fisherman
In the lawsuit, the man stated that the artist’s construction was illegal, but did not appear at the hearing.
A fisherman sued musical performer Philip Kirkorov over an allegedly illegally installed pier at his dacha near Moscow.
Channel Five writes about this.
Nevertheless, the Saratov fisherman failed to win the case.
The complaint against the singer was considered by the Odintsovo City Court. According to the lawyer, documents and design projects were presented in court that confirmed the legality of all structures installed on the territory of the celebrity’s house.
As the head of the law firm, Alexander Dobrovinsky, clarifies, the construction of the pier did not leave the plaintiff a chance to go fishing.
The application for the performer was submitted on January 11.
The star lawyer jokingly said that the man probably planned to fish exclusively from the artist’s house.
Ironically, Dobrovinsky clarified that he would ask Kirkorov to provide the plaintiff with his balcony for fishing.
He emphasized that from that place it is possible to cast the spinning rod further.
The somnologist named the causes of sleep problems
Somnologist Sofia Cherkasova spoke about foods and habits that interfere with healthy sleep.
As the specialist noted, sleep problems often arise due to products containing caffeine.
We are talking primarily about tea, coffee, chocolate and any desserts containing cocoa.
Their use before bedtime should be limited, since they not only interfere with falling asleep, but also make sleep “ragged”, which means it does not allow the body to fully recover.
According to the doctor, it is better to stop consuming caffeine-containing products 6-8 hours before bedtime.
Otherwise, they help lower the threshold of excitability of the nervous system and, as a result, have difficulty falling asleep.
Alcohol also has a negative effect on the ability to fall asleep.
The doctor clarifies that small doses of alcoholic drinks promote relaxation and do not affect sleep.
However, amounts exceeding 36 grams of pure alcohol lead to various sleep disturbances, such as shallow sleep and frequent awakenings at night.
In addition, to prevent problems with falling asleep, the somnologist recommends avoiding spicy foods in large portions.
Large volumes and spicy foods increase core body temperature, which negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
For healthy sleep, it is necessary not only to observe the external temperature regime: the optimal air temperature is 18-20 degrees - but also the absence of elevated body temperature.
According to Cherkasova, you shouldn’t overindulge in heavy food before bed, as it will not allow the body to fully recover and rest: it will be forced to spend energy on digestion.
The doctor also reminded that the lack of healthy sleep and accumulated sleep deprivation affect the quality of life and normal activities, so it is extremely important to adhere to a sleep and rest regime and allow the body to recover.
Bloomberg named Trump's competitor in the upcoming presidential election: In the world: Politics: INFOX.ru
According to the agency, the ex-president's main competitor in the upcoming elections will be Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.
Republican DeSantis has not yet officially announced his intention to enter the race for the presidency, but Bloomberg sources report that he is already preparing for the primaries.
According to the agency, Desantis’ team is already selecting consultants to participate in the presidential elections and conducting preliminary polls.
In confirmation of this, Bloomberg reports a retreat planned for the end of February for Republican Party leaders and government officials.
The agency reports that the Florida governor's team is seeking support among fellow Republicans from Iowa, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and other states. Bloomberg experts called DeSantis the main potential competitor to Donald Trump.
Experts believe the current Florida governor is well-known enough that he does not need to launch an election campaign right now, and they also note his ability to raise money.
Ron DeSantis supported Donald Trump's presidential bid in 2017, and may compete with him in the upcoming November 2024 presidential election.
Donald Trump officially announced his intention to run for president "to make America great again" ... during a speech to his supporters in Florida.
Incumbent President Joe Biden, despite his team's assurances of its intention to take part in the 60th presidential election, announced the absence of a firm decision on this issue.
Hundreds of demonstrations against pension reform will take place in France on Saturday
The fourth day of mass protests against pension reform is being held by French trade unions on Saturday.
Hundreds of demonstrations will take place across the country, French media report.
After a slight decrease in the number of participants in protests last Tuesday compared to the first two “days of mobilization,” trade unions hope to bring more protesters onto the streets this time, taking into account those citizens who did not have the opportunity to participate in demonstrations on a weekday.
Law enforcement agencies expect from 600 thousand to 800 thousand demonstrators across the country, including in Paris - from 90 thousand to 120 thousand, media write.
On February 7, 757 thousand people took part in protests against pension reform, according to the French Ministry of Internal Affairs.
The largest trade union association, the General Confederation of Labor (CGT), announced 2 million demonstrators.
Also, according to the CGT, 400 thousand demonstrators took to the streets in Paris on Tuesday.
Police say there were 57,000 of them.
On the previous day of protests, January 31, the number of demonstrators was 1.27 million, according to police estimates, and 2.8 million, according to trade unions.
The next mass protests are planned for February 16.
As reported, on January 10, French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne presented the pension reform draft developed by the government, which provides for increasing the retirement age from 62 to 64 years.
It is assumed that the established retirement age will gradually shift from 62 to 64 by three months per year, and this process will last until 2030.
The new regime will apply starting with generations of French people born in September 1961 or after.
French President Emmanuel Macron stated during the 2022 election campaign his determination to carry out pension reform before the end of his second presidential mandate.
On February 6, the French National Assembly began consideration of the government draft pension reform.

More than 180 accidents occurred per day in Astana: February 11, 2023, 14:10
ASTANA.KAZINFORM - The capital's police department calls on you to be extremely careful on the roads, to take into account the influence of weather conditions, reduced visibility during precipitation, and changes in the adhesion qualities of the roadway in icy conditions.
Over the past 24 hours, 181 accidents have been registered.
This was reported by MIA Kazinform with reference to the press service of the Astana police department.
“Pedestrians should also be careful on the road, since their violation of the rules for crossing the roadway also often leads to serious consequences.
This year, there were 11 incidents of collisions with pedestrians who were crossing the roadway in violation of established requirements; all 11 pedestrians were injured.

Depressurization of Progress MS-21 occurred on the ISS: February 12, 2023, 00:12
TASS - KAZINFORM - Roscosmos reported the depressurization of the Progress MS-21, prepared for undocking from the ISS, reports MIA Kazinform with reference to TASS.
“The circuit of the Progress MS-21 transport cargo ship, the sinking of which is scheduled for February 18, is depressurized, confirmed telemetry data received by the control center,” the press service of Roscosmos reported.
As noted, it is currently isolated from the total volume of the station.
The causes of the incident are being clarified; it did not affect either the docking of the Progress MS-22 cargo ship or the further ISS flight program.
Sergei Krikalev, executive director of Roscosmos for manned space programs, commented on the situation.
“On a cargo ship that has been docked at the station for several months, there was a coolant leak from the thermal control system.
The situation is somewhat similar to what happened with our ship (Soyuz MS-22 - TASS note) in mid-December,” he said, noting that the commission that analyzed the Soyuz incident concluded that the leak was caused by a micrometeoroid.
Roscosmos will conduct an analysis to ensure there are no problems during future launches.
“We need to conduct an in-depth analysis to make sure that this reason does not apply to similar designs in future launches.
This is the most important task that will now confront us,” he said.
According to the executive director, an analysis will have to be carried out in terms of preparing the ship for launch, the materials that were used, and the technologies that were used in assembling the radiator.
The same analysis was carried out in the case of the damaged radiator of the Soyuz MS-22 spacecraft.
“The most important thing is to make sure that this is not some kind of systematic error,” Krikalev added.
The executive director clarified that a commission began work on Saturday that will analyze all possible reasons.
“The ship was supposed to be undocking and lowered from orbit two days before the launch of the Soyuz spacecraft (Soyuz MS-23 - TASS note), so there would be serious consequences on the actions of the crew, on the work of the crew... On the program from this point of view this will not affect," Krikalev noted.
The Progress MS-21 truck was launched from Baikonur on a Soyuz-2.1a launch vehicle on October 26.
Two days later, it docked with the small research module “Poisk” of the Russian segment of the ISS.
The spacecraft delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS.
NASA named the place where Progress was depressurized
Depressurization of the Progress MS-21 cargo ship on the International Space Station (ISS) occurred in the thermal control system.
This was announced by a representative of the American Mission Control Center (MCC) during negotiations with the ISS crew, broadcast by NASA.
Now, according to NASA, the coolant leak from Progress has stopped.
NASA believes that all the coolant has completely escaped.
“This morning we had a refrigerant leak from the thermal control system into space, the refrigerant leak has stopped,” said a representative of the American Mission Control Center (quoted by Interfax).
Previously, the Progress circuit was isolated due to depressurization.
Roscosmos reported that the cosmonauts are not in danger.
Progress MS-22 docked to the ISS today, February 11, and will be removed from orbit, according to plan, on February 18.
John Kirby, coordinator of strategic communications at the US National Security Council, refused to announce US President Joe Biden's possible trip to Ukraine.
He told reporters about this at a briefing, broadcast on the White House YouTube channel.
Kirby noted that he had “nothing to announce about additional travel points” for the American leader to Poland.
The day before, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre announced Biden's visit to Poland from February 20 to 22.
During the trip, the US President will discuss bilateral cooperation with the Polish leadership, as well as collective efforts to support Ukraine and strengthen NATO's deterrence capabilities, an administration spokeswoman said.
Previously, Kirby said Biden would visit Ukraine when the time was right, but now was not the time for official visits.
A fitness expert talks about working out outdoors in winter for weight loss
A fitness expert called walking in winter a great way to lose weight without intense exercise.
Fitness expert Anthony Yeung talks about how outdoor interval training can be effective for weight loss.
His words are quoted by the portal Eat This, Not That.
The specialist called active walks in winter an excellent way to lose weight without intense exercise, as well as improve the condition of the cardiovascular system and psychological health.
“Walk at a normal pace for the first five to ten minutes to warm up your body and joints.
Then walk as fast as you can for one minute without breaking into a run.
One minute - at a normal pace," explains Yeung.
Three approaches are required.
Next, the specialist advises doing lunges or squats with weights for 15 seconds, and then walking at a comfortable speed for another 45 seconds.
You need to repeat this sequence five times. Then Yeung suggests alternating between an active step (two minutes) and a calm step (one minute) three more times.
Finish your walk with a five-minute walk at a calm pace and a few stretching exercises.
In total, this workout will require 35 minutes of fresh air.
Earlier, Master of Sports in Athletics Maxim Babenko-Kudryavtsev, in a commentary to Lenta.ru, gave advice on choosing equipment for winter jogging.
“You will need thermal underwear, moisture-wicking items, and special light but warm hats.
Shoes for running in winter are distinguished by denser materials, a higher platform and sole tread,” said the athlete.

The head of Serpukhov checked the contents of the ICD
Head of the city Serpukhov Sergey Nikitenko made a working tour of the territories.
Together with representatives of management organizations, he inspected the maintenance of apartment buildings and residential buildings.
The addresses where the most requests from residents came from were subject to the strictest control.
- Many comments are quite justified and relate, first of all, to the cleaning of entrances and maintenance of common areas.
The residents of Serpukhovich themselves do not stand aside and are actively fighting the problem of vandalism, especially widespread in terms of graffiti.
We will work on the issue taking into account the “Safe Region” cameras,” said the head of the municipality, Sergei Nikitenko.
Attention was also drawn to the change of mailboxes, light bulbs, installation of wires in boxes, and untimely removal of garbage from container sites.
As soon as possible, management companies must solve all the tasks assigned to them.
The deputy general director of Russian Railways suggested that the governor of the Irkutsk region develop new sales areas
The Irkutsk region needs to continue to develop alternative sales directions other than the Far East.
This includes both the domestic market and Western ports, including the Azov-Black Sea basin.
This proposal was made by Deputy General Director of Russian Railways Alexey Shilo at a meeting with Governor Igor Kobzev, the regional government reported on February 10, 2023.
- As the practice of last year showed, even despite the geographical location of the Irkutsk region, this solution can be extremely effective.
It is important that logistics services of companies constantly interact with our “connectors” (ports, operators, maritime transport) and find optimal price conditions for transporting their products under new schemes, emphasized Alexey Shilo.
The governor noted the importance of stability in the shipment of products; the Irkutsk region is one of the richest regions of the Russian Federation in mineral resources and has significant reserves of hard and brown coal.
About 25 enterprises are engaged in coal mining in the region.
The instability of shipments of products for export has a negative impact on the financial and economic activities of coal mining companies.
Igor Kobzev also emphasized that the Irkutsk region is an export-oriented region, therefore it is necessary to increase the size of monthly quotas for the transportation of timber and metallurgical products produced in the region to a level that ensures the stable operation of such enterprises.
- Understanding the importance of the Irkutsk region as an industrial center, we, for our part, will try to do everything to provide support in terms of transportation volumes.
If additional volumes of shipment to the domestic market appear, then we are also ready to provide assistance in this area,” said Alexey Shilo.

The overhaul of Khomutovskaya secondary school No. 2 began in 2022.
Primary school students were assigned to Khomutovskaya school No. 1, high school students study in the second building of school No. 2.
According to the renovation plan, the roof, utilities, windows and related elements will be replaced, the façade will be repaired, and interior decoration will be carried out.
An important component of the overhaul is the reconstruction of a heating point with water heating, instead of which dry heat was used.
The cost of all work is more than 80 million rubles.
The renovation is in its final stage, there are problems with connecting to the power grid - the power needs to be increased, work is underway with the energy supply organization.
In addition, in Granovshchina and Khomutovo, Konstantin Zaitsev held a meeting with citizens, some of whom the developers sold houses illegally connected to electrical networks.
It was decided that the network company would organize a personal meeting next week to legally resolve these issues.
- Very often, the issue of stable power supply is the main condition when buying a house, because the population is increasingly using electric energy for heating.
Therefore, sellers sometimes arbitrarily connect houses to nearby networks, and this is already grounds for turning off the power supply.
Therefore, now network companies in those territories where active construction is underway must pay special attention to this issue,” emphasized Konstantin Zaitsev.
Anatoly Prokopyev assessed the effectiveness of state support measures for peasant farms of the UOBO
The head of the UOBO, Anatoly Prokopyev, visited three peasant farms in the Ekhirit-Bulagat district today.
The head of a peasant farm in the village of Kapsal, Yulia Madaeva, received a grant for the development of her farm as a beginning farmer in 2014.
One of the main activities of the farm is the production of livestock products.
Every year the number of livestock increases and the gross production of meat and milk increases.
Later, thanks to government support, the opportunity arose in 2019 to participate and win a grant in the form of subsidies for the development of a family dairy farm.
Today the cattle population on the farm is about 150 heads, 60 of which are cows.
In addition, they grow grain crops here and sow annual fodder crops.
Thanks to the activities of the peasant farm of Viktor Katanaev, the Kharyashino area in the village of Kulunkun was transferred to the category of populated areas.
The farm raises and fattens dairy cattle.
In 2014, a grant was received for the development of a family dairy farm for 60 animals.
Today the farm has 150 cattle.
They have also been growing potatoes here for many years.
The head of the peasant farm tries to create for the team all the necessary conditions for work and living.
There is now a whole village on the farm territory.
Anatoly Prokopyev took personal control over the construction of a two-kilometer road from the Kharyashino area to Ust-Ordynskoye.
The main activities of the peasant farm Stalina Mogzoeva in the village of Otonkhoy are breeding cattle and buffaloes.
In 2020, the farm participated in a competitive selection and received an AGROSTARTAP grant for the development of a peasant meat farm.
These funds were used to purchase a tractor trailer, two balers and a mower.
The head of the farm annually increases the number of livestock and increases the gross production of meat.
In addition, the peasant farm sows annual forage crops on an area of 40 hectares.
Stalina Mogzoeva plans to open a feedlot.
Based on the results of visiting three farms, the head of the district noted that government support measures are effective, necessary, necessary.
- The government of the Irkutsk region pays great attention to agriculture.
Therefore, government support should not only be maintained, but also increase and improve.
We, in turn, must be the guarantor of food security.
Agricultural producers of the district fulfill this role with honor,” Anatoly Prokopyev emphasized.
The crossing on the Armenian-Turkish border was opened for the first time in decades for the delivery of humanitarian aid
The Margara-Alijan border checkpoint on the border between Turkey and Armenia was opened for the first time in three decades to deliver humanitarian aid to earthquake victims.
Turkish and Armenian media write about this.
The same crossing was used to deliver humanitarian aid from Turkey to Armenia after the devastating earthquake of 1988, notes the Turkish Anadolu Agency.
On Saturday, Armenia sent five trucks with 100 tons of food, medicine, water and other emergency aid packages to the city of Adiyaman in southern Turkey, Ankara's special representative at the Armenian-Turkish negotiations Serdar Kilic said.
He expressed gratitude to the Vice-Speaker of the Armenian Parliament Ruben Rubinyan and the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Armenia Vahan Kostanyan.
“I will always remember the help sent by the people of Armenia to alleviate the suffering of our people in the earthquake-stricken region,” Kilych wrote on his Twitter page.
Press Secretary of the Armenian Foreign Ministry Vahan Hunanyan, in turn, said that trucks with humanitarian aid crossed the border through the Margara Bridge and were heading to the earthquake-stricken region.
According to Public Radio of Armenia, the last time a car crossed the Margara Bridge was 30 years ago, in 1993.
Since then, the Armenian-Turkish land border has been closed.
The Turkish Anadolu Agency provides other data and writes that the Margara-Alijan border point was last used to supply humanitarian supplies to Armenia to eliminate the consequences of the devastating 1988 earthquake.
Then, aid collected through the Turkish Red Crescent was delivered to the disaster zone in Armenia.
Previously, Armenia sent 27 rescuers to Turkey and another 29 rescuers to Syria in areas affected by the earthquake.
According to the latest data, more than 25 thousand people died in Turkey and Syria from the devastating earthquake that happened on Monday.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on February 11 that 21,848 people have already died in Turkey.
On the Syrian side, 3,553 deaths were reported.
Relations between Turkey and Armenia are clouded mainly by Ankara's refusal to recognize the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire and its support of Baku during the First and Second Karabakh Wars.
Recently, Yerevan and Ankara have made a number of attempts to normalize relations.
In 2021, Armenia and Turkey appointed special representatives who met several times in Vienna to discuss normalization issues.
In February 2022, commercial flights between Yerevan and Istanbul resumed after a two-year break.
In July 2022, Ankara and Yerevan agreed on the possibility of opening the land border to citizens of third countries as soon as possible.

In particular, he said that he was impressed by the football player’s performance at the last World Cup.

"Fernandez is Makelele plus Lampard.
If you need him to play in Makelele's position, he can play very well there.
"The guy also has a good goal-scoring instinct, a good shot from outside the box, so if you need him to play behind a striker like Lampard or Essien, he can do it," Crespo told British media.
Let us remind you that Enzo Fernandez moved to Chelsea for 121 million euros.

Forecast for the Club World Cup match Real Madrid - Al-Hilal on February 11, 2023
On February 11, the final of the FIFA Club World Cup will be held at the Prince Moula Abdullah Stadium in the Moroccan city of Rabat.
Real Madrid and Al-Hilal from Saudi Arabia will meet in the match for the trophy.
The game will start at 22.00 Moscow time, and the live broadcast at 21.55 Moscow time will be shown on the matchtv.ru website and the Match! Football 2 TV channel.
Analysts at the bookmaker BETSITI consider the Blancos to be huge favorites: you can bet on Real Madrid winning in regular time with odds of 1.28, the probability is approximately 77%.
The success of nominal guests is available for 11.0 (8%).
Even for a draw, a noticeably lower quote of 6.10 (15%) was offered.
Do you believe that teams will not reveal the strongest in 90 minutes?
A bet of 1000 rubles on a “peaceful” result will bring 6100 rubles if you win.
You can bet on Madrid's triumph, taking into account extra time and penalties, for 1.14, this market at Al-Hilal goes for 5.80.
The team from Saudi Arabia went through two rounds on the way to the final, beating the Moroccan Wydad in a penalty shootout and the Brazilian Flamengo in regular time (3:2).
You can bet that the outsider will at least not lose to the Europeans in 90 minutes for 3.90.
Analysts are anticipating a large number of goals: a total of more than 2.5 goals is available for 1.53, 2.5 goals for 2.60.
Blancos are clearly superior in class to their opponents, whose squad is worth just €39.6 million, according to statistics website Transfermarkt.
For comparison: Real Madrid's roster is valued at 849 million euros.
In addition, to the horror of Al-Hilal, Madrid's main striker and current Ballon d'Or winner Karim Benzema will recover for the final.
But even without the Frenchman, Real is performing effectively in this tournament: in the semi-finals it defeated the Egyptian Al-Ahly 4:1.
The Arabian matches also turned out to be quite bright: in the quarter finals they scored a 1:1 draw and won in a penalty shootout, and in the semifinals they scored a dramatic 3:2.
Recommended bet: Real Madrid win and TB 2.5 for 1.76.
Guberniev said that midfielder Pavel Mamaev had decided to end his playing career.
Well-known TV commentator Dmitry Guberniev said that midfielder Pavel Mamaev had decided to end his playing career.
“Now it will be possible to cast a bust in the hero’s homeland.
He made a big mistake and for most people he will be remembered not as a footballer, but as a delinquent footballer.
But he is still far from Kokorin.
Because no one could waste their potential like Kokorin.
Mamaev, for all his talents, was periodically noticeable.
I can only wish him good luck and realize himself somewhere else,” Metaratings.ru quotes Guberniev.
The 34-year-old midfielder's last club was Khimki.
The Moscow region club did not renew the contract with the midfielder in the summer of 2022.
Previously, Mamaev played for Torpedo, CSKA, Krasnodar and Rostov.
Mamaev is the champion of Russia, three-time winner of the Russian Cup and two-time winner of the country's Super Cup as part of CSKA.

A tanker with diesel from a ship previously sailing under the Russian flag was not allowed into the port of Spain
The Tarragona Maritime Command of the General Directorate of Merchant Marine under the Spanish Ministry of Transport has prohibited the Maersk Magellan from entering the city's port to unload diesel fuel, since the cargo comes from the Nobel, which sailed under the Russian flag until July 1, 2022, the Spanish Ministry of Transport reported.
“The Tarragona Maritime Command of the General Directorate of Merchant Marine under the Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Development has prohibited the entry into the port of Tarragona to unload diesel fuel on the Singapore-flagged Maersk Magellan because the cargo it is carrying originates from a Cameroonian-flagged vessel.” Nobel" which flew under the Russian flag until July 1, 2022," the ministry said in a statement.
The measure was taken in accordance with EU legislation, which prohibits access for any vessel registered under the Russian flag since April 16, 2022, or changed flag after February 24, 2022.
The ministry clarified that the inspection was carried out on February 9, after which the ban was agreed upon.
The ministry recalled that this is not the first time that ships are prohibited from entering Spanish ports.
In April 2022, the Maltese-flagged Black Star, which was carrying cargo from a Russian-flagged vessel, was denied entry to the port of Barcelona.
In 2022, after strengthening anti-Russian sanctions, the EU, USA and UK introduced restrictions on the supply of Russian petroleum products, and then decided to limit fuel prices.
Since December 5, 2022, a price ceiling for seaborne oil supplies from the Russian Federation introduced by unfriendly countries has been in effect.

The problems encountered by pregnant Russian women with entry into Argentina were explained
According to the expert, amid the influx of people wishing to give birth to a child in Argentina, the country's authorities began to more closely monitor the entry of foreign citizens into their territory.
Difficulties with the entry of pregnant Russian women into Argentina are due to the fact that the country’s authorities are not interested in a massive influx of foreigners who want to obtain citizenship for their children and a residence permit for themselves, and then leave.
This was reported by Lenta.ru with reference to St. Petersburg State University professor Viktor Kheifets, editor-in-chief of the Latin America magazine.
According to him, no country supports such a practice.
He noted that Argentina does not approve of turning the country into a transit point rather than a destination.
This applies to those who violate constitutional practice.
As the expert explained, the child will retain Argentine citizenship, but the decision on whether to provide an Argentine passport to the parents after receiving a residence permit will be made by the court.
If it turns out that they did not actually live in Argentina and immediately left, citizenship may be denied.
This applies not only to Russians, but also to citizens of other countries.
Recently, as the specialist pointed out, maternity tours to Argentina are especially popular among Russians and Ukrainians.
Let us remind you that Argentina grants citizenship by “law of the soil”, that is, if a person was born on its territory.
An Argentine passport provides visa-free access to 170 countries, including EU countries and the UK.
Earlier it was reported that Argentina began to revoke residence permits of Russians who received the document through the birth of a child, but left the country.
Buenos Aires is interested in reducing such cases.
It also became known that six pregnant Russian citizens were denied entry to Argentina due to suspicion of providing false information about the reasons for the trip.
Hundreds of new fitness clubs are predicted to open in Russia
In Russia, citizens' interest in fitness services is being restored, which allows market participants to expand their business.
This year, more than 400 new facilities, mostly small-format ones, may open in the country.
About 400 new fitness clubs may open in Russia, their total number may increase by 5 percent.
According to Kommersant, several dozen players may leave the Russian market.
By the end of the year there will be about 8.6 thousand clubs in Russia.
According to the publication, most new clubs are small-format projects with small initial investments and quick payback.
This data is provided by representatives of the National Fitness Community.
The President of the Association of Fitness Industry Operators Olga Kiseleva, in a conversation with the publication, noted that 340-420 new fitness clubs will be small, the rest will occupy an area of more than 500 square meters.
NSF President Elena Silina noted that since 2020, every year there have been more club closures than openings.
Over the past three years, their number has decreased by 37 percent.
At the same time, independent analysts provide different figures.
According to Kontur.Focus, over the past three years, the number of organizations with the main activity of “operating a fitness center” has grown by 10.1 percent, and now there are 5.12 thousand.
The industry suffered heavy losses due to the pandemic, but in 2021 it began to recover.
According to 2GIS data, there are 4.5 thousand fitness clubs in Russian cities with a population of over a million.
Russians have begun to pay more attention to physical activity, as evidenced by the increase in attendance at fitness clubs.
At the end of January 2023, attendance increased by 9.3 percent year on year.
As Silina noted, if the trend can be maintained, then by the end of the year the industry will return to pre-crisis levels.
A management company from Kirov had its license taken away
The Arbitration Court of the Kirov Region revoked the license to carry out business activities for managing apartment buildings, issued to the management company "Zabota".
In the Kirov region, by decision of the regional Arbitration Court, the license to carry out business activities for managing apartment buildings previously issued to the management company "Zabota" was revoked.
According to the regional State Housing Inspectorate, the court decision was made in November 2022, but came into force only in February 2023.
The arbitration deprived the “manager” of her license because the organization ignored the instructions of the State Housing Inspectorate several times.
Currently, all objects that were managed by “Zabota” have been excluded from the register of licenses for carrying out business activities for managing apartment buildings.
Their total area was 64.8 thousand square meters.
All houses are located in the regional center.
The Kirov administration knows that they are left without a management company.
In accordance with the requirements of Russian legislation, the State Housing Inspectorate informed the mayor's office about the current situation.
Let us recall that in January 2023, the governor of the Kirov region, Alexander Sokolov, set the State Housing Inspectorate employees the task of liquidating 2/3 of the region’s management companies by spring, since there are too many of them.
The legality of the governor's demands raised doubts among the Kirov communists.
They contacted the regional prosecutor's office and asked to bring Sokolov to administrative responsibility.
Presumably, the Federal Antimonopoly Service could have taken the same position.
Antimonopoly officials allegedly also asked the prosecutor's office to check the legality of the actions of the regional leader.
Wildberries will make paid packages at pick-up points
The Wildberries marketplace will make packages at pick-up points chargeable starting February 13.

Previously, Wildberries clients caught the platform debiting funds from cards whose data had previously been deleted from their personal account.
Buyers fear this comes with major security risks.
The support service, in turn, explained that this is provided for in the user agreement.
As follows from it, the company has the right to write off money from remote cards without notifying the client if payment from others does not go through for one reason or another.
The company, commenting on the situation, stated that payments to customers are carried out with the permission of customers, and no leakage of bank card data can occur.

My daughter and I came to apply for a pension.
They received me warmly, everything was explained clearly, the documents were scanned, the application was filled out, and they told me how to sign up for subsequent appointments.
Upon entering, the administrator and security greet you culturally and respectfully.
The building is decent, everything is equipped for people - there is a hall, a toilet, although it would not hurt to buy a water cooler.
We came 2 times, everything was great!
I wish all employees peace, goodness, good luck and decent wages in this difficult time for everyone!!!
Simply a great place!
After a long walk on the beach, there is nothing better than sitting by the window with a cup of mulled wine while waiting for a salad with scallops (which tastes simply incomparable!!!)
I highly recommend this wonderful place!!!)))
The nice cash register worker asked me to bring me coffee with her or in the hall, 200 or 300 ml.
I asked in the hall for 300 ml.
After a couple of minutes they give me a plastic cup.
I wanted to do ceramics, that’s why I did it “in the hall”.
They did it to me.
I ask why in a glass and not in a cup.
The girl replies that they don’t have 300 ml cups.
How does this fit into a person’s head?
Ask with yourself or in the hall, i.e. Determine the technology for yourself: pour coffee into a cup or disposable cup.
Get the answer - in the hall, i.e. in a cup.
Specify the volume.
Hear that 300 ml.
Present a person with the fact that there are no cups of this volume.
Here, they say, is a paper cup, 300 ml.
It is noteworthy that this is the third such case in Zelenaya Okolitsa in my memory.
It is doubly remarkable that I was not offered a standard cup so that I could pour the contents of a plastic cup into it and drink the coffee the way I wanted. I asked her myself.
A number of questions arise.
1. Are the Zelenaya Okolitsa cafeteria and the Green Okolitsa sides of the same coin or are organizations in no way connected with each other?
If unrelated, understanding emerges.
If related, why did a food and retail enterprise known in the city for its service and quality condescend to the rhetoric of a kiosk at the Kazansky railway station?
Rhetoric because, I repeat, this is the third time such a case has happened to me.
I do not rule out that this is happening not only to me.
2. Does the cashier have instructions?
I got the impression that she acts on instinct.
I hope I'm wrong.
Please describe the actions for your employees in this case, if you are trying to contact the service.
We really like the circus; we have been going there since we were children.
I saw numbers with Yu Nikulin himself.
And now with children and nephews.
I like the atmosphere in the circus, as well as the programs.
The location of the seats is very convenient.
You can see the arena from almost any point and the backs of those sitting in front do not interfere with you.
The circus is very intimate, family-friendly!
This time we went to the New Year's program.
We were a little upset.
Lots of clowns and acrobats.
I would like a room with magic tricks and more animals.
It's a shame that you can't take pictures with animals in the lobby anymore.
But apparently there are reasons for this.
Overall a very nice place!!
I wish you prosperity and delight us with your numbers!!!
I liked the developer Otdelstroy, he chooses good places to build residential complexes.
They use high-quality materials, which fully justifies the price.
Before purchasing, we were invited to look at the complex, when there weren’t even any walls yet, so that we could see everything in person, although we looked at many apartments and not a single developer offered us this.
Favorite ski resort in Russia!
The most thrilling thing is the gently sloping, sparse forests, especially when there is a lot of soft snow.
But for me the routes are a bit boring and short.
The longest ones are in sector e, even more or less there.
But overall a great atmosphere, many different cafes and bars, so a fun ski mood is guaranteed!
Great master Peri!
She did everything as quickly and efficiently as possible, the salon was clean and pleasant.
Good service, friendly staff, cloakroom and water available.
Disgusting service.
This is the second time I’ve come to pick up my order at the ready time indicated in the app and wait at the windowsill for more than 30 minutes for my order.
Such service is unacceptable in business today!
The response from the “care” service is that we are trying.
At the checkout, even without an apology, simply - it’s not our fault, it’s the program.
You did not find any other technical means of communication with regular, previously loyal customers.
Impotent people “try”, but business must work.
Thanks everyone, we're all leaving.
We will not order from you again and even less recommend it.
A spoiled mood, waiting for guests, apologies from the hostess are not the best sauce for hot rolls.
I ordered a car (Jeep Wrangler Sahara) through an organization.
I expected to receive the car in 3-3.5 months (as agreed), but in fact it took 4.5 months - the delay was caused by the situation on the border of Lithuania with Belarus (Lithuania complied).
As a result, I am very pleased with the car, thanks to the guys - Dmitry, Stas, Alexander - always in touch, up-to-date information, professional advice and normal human attitude.
Thanks again!
We rented a house for 4 days for 3 people.
The houses are clean, cozy, warm (even very warm), the house has its own small kitchen with coffee, tea, sugar, spices, sunflower oil, all the necessary utensils.
Detergent and sponge included.
The only downside is that there is too little space and the bathroom has a terribly small shower.
There is no place to store snowboards or skis, and there is nowhere to dry things, so we had to borrow a dryer from the owners and push it in instead of a chair, and put a heater under it.
But overall it’s a good option in a quiet place.
Stylish, clean, spacious.
The food is delicious, the choice of dishes is sufficient for the needs of any guest.
Prices are reasonable.
There are wines and beers for those who want to drink.
Moscow center, I recommend
Wonderful place with very polite staff, we will definitely come again.
The territory has all the necessary amenities, including parking and billiards.
The rooms are in good repair and have all the amenities.
A beautiful and aesthetic place, we walked during a visit to Kaliningrad.
I really liked Russia in miniature, Ozerov Park and the landscape.
In winter there are many natural slides for children)
Very cool tobacco and hookah store)
We shop here all the time, the prices are low and the quality is top notch!
Very responsive staff, they will give you advice and answer all your questions)
I recommend this store to everyone to visit! ❤️
The location is convenient for anyone.
For me personally it's normal.
They serve quickly, unless one of the visitors is stupid.
Registration is convenient.
The staff is attentive, they will give you advice, guide you, and give you advice even if you don’t come on visiting days.
In principle it's normal.
Great guys!
Thanks a lot!
Everything was done quickly and efficiently, the prices were reasonable compared to other services.
I thought the remote control was going to be thrown away, but they were so smart and did everything for me.
Many thanks to the young guys!
I ordered a bouquet of 21 tulips with delivery in 2 hours on March 8th.
Flowers were delivered 6 hours later, packaged as if they had been stolen (there was barely enough paper to wrap the flowers).
Then, when the flowers were already in the vase, I realized that something was wrong.
I compared it with the photo on the website and the color was not at all what I ordered.
I decided to count it and it turned out that there were an even number of tulips, 20.
Support on WhatsApp responded to my indignation about the color and number of colors, “apparently they mixed up the color.”
The next day I wrote again and was offered a 15% refund.
It seems to me that this is an extreme degree of impudence and most likely falls under the definition of fraud.
I have already sent a statement to the tax office regarding the fact that they refused to give me a check.
Rospotrebnadzor and the court are next in line.
I do not recommend anyone to contact this organization.
For more than 10 years I have been going to hairdresser Samira for hair coloring and cutting.
I want to cancel the professionalism of master Samira, she does her job perfectly, I am always satisfied with her work.
She always listens carefully to the client's wishes, and the client is always satisfied with the result.
I strongly recommend this master to all my family and friends.
All her work is always done at the highest level!!!'
A huge thank you to Master Samira 😍
Hello, I was in this gaming club, I can say the prices are excellent, there are a lot of gaming computers, there are also drinks and food.
Of the minuses, some keyboards are broken, buttons fly off, if we take “normal gameplay” then the computers don’t handle well :(
Therefore the rating is 4🥸
This place has become our family tradition)
My son goes to work out in his group, and my mother goes to fitbox in the evening.
The administrators are super attentive and the trainers are professional.
They organize themed parties for children, monitor cleanliness and exercise equipment.
It's nice to walk and exercise.
A 6-year-old child can already handle a punch well and has strong general physical training.
Recommended for children, mothers and fathers)
The best masters!
Irina is just gold!!
She does the work efficiently, is caring, and clarifies everything.
You can always talk about anything with girls!
It was the third time!
I won't regret it for anything!
I can finally grow my hair after bleaching!!!
Vita is also studying color design.
Therefore, she is the one who will soon be able to combine blond with keratin!
And your hair will thank you 🥰🥰
Inspector Elena Polyanskaya is a very responsive technician and clearly explained everything that is included in the routine maintenance.
She also provided every assistance during the repair of my car.
And also thanks to master Valery Ushakov for his attentive and professional work.
He was ready to answer any question.
The work was carried out efficiently.
The only thing that confused me when registering for maintenance was the insufficiently correct information on the work regulations; when I showed up for maintenance, the regulations were more clearly explained.
I would like to express my deep gratitude to the Administration staff.
A very rare certificate was needed for the guardianship authorities to approve a real estate transaction; the employees greeted me very kindly and helped to issue this certificate, although they could have refused, since it was not part of their duties.
Thanks a lot!
Very friendly people work here.
Wonderful, sincere, polite employees, I didn’t regret coming to this hairdresser!👍
Master Nahida did an impeccable highlighting, haircut, took into account and understood all my wishes, I definitely recommend it to everyone❤️
I really liked the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin.
It was restored for the 800th anniversary, everything inside is stylish and clean.
There are also cafes and toilets for tourists.
I went on a tour, it was great too.
And I definitely recommend the Russian building of the Nizhny Novgorod Art Museum - an unexpectedly wonderful collection
We have known Olya for more than 3 years, we use the services regularly.
During this time, we saw how Olya develops in her favorite activity, constantly learns new things and expands the space for four-legged animals, which only inspires admiration and trust.
We always leave our dog with peace of mind.
Daily video reports, if necessary, will be picked up/taken away by pet taxi.
They’ll also bring you something clean and tasty)
absolutely a fairy tale 🥰
Thank you for your care and attentive personal attitude towards our pets 🐕💜
The restaurant Sytyi Los is located next to the Medvedkovo metro station.
The restaurant is very cozy!
They prepare delicious dishes.
The menu is varied.
It is advisable to make reservations in advance before visiting, especially on Fridays!
Nice well maintained zoo.
Smaller than Moscow, but just as interesting and convenient.
We visited on weekdays - admission for adults was 300 RUR, for schoolchildren 170.
There were few people, we enjoyed walking around and looking at the animals.
The anteater was impressive)
By the way, he was not seen in Moscow.
On the territory there are a couple of cafes with reasonable prices, the toilet is clean and free, and we also saw a phone charging station.
Overall, I recommend it 👍
The salon is at the highest level!!!
I am very pleased with the services of cosmetologist Natalia Kuznetsova, I only go to her.
I do various facial cleansings - both hardware and mechanical.
100% satisfied.
Master of his craft👍
She tells everything in detail about the characteristics of the skin, she selected cosmetics that suit my skin type, just perfect.
Now I walk around happy and beautiful!!!
Thanks Natalya!!!
An excellent club with a huge space, a swimming pool, a sauna, a hammam and excellent trainers!
The downside is the huge number of pensioners in the pool and in the locker room area.
It feels like they come to the club as if they were visiting a public bathhouse!
Particular emphasis on the women's department.
On weekdays, starting from 19:00 there are a lot of people!
I’m giving it a three, and that’s only thanks to the first visit, when I got to the consultant, if I’m not mistaken Timur, but I could be wrong.
I completed everything quickly, explained everything +/-, everything was clear, my son also decided to draw up a card, and alas, the consultants are busy with their own business, the clients are waiting, the consultant finally approached my son, who couldn’t care less, and sent him to the meeting room several times, which is kind of funny discussing, in the end the son left without formalizing anything; in response to forgiveness, the consultant said, well, whatever you want, as you wish, since I was present at this meeting, I was surprised.
New office, in a new format, everything is comfortable and such an attitude.
It’s a pity that the first impression was cancelled, now we are visiting another branch, and the attitude towards customers there does not depend on the change of employees.
The choice is very large, the quality is good (the fabric is resistant to pilling), the staff knows their assortment and helps in choosing styles.
You can dress both a slender woman and a child with a non-standard figure and height.
They are located close to the metro and even have a small parking lot.
We recommend!
I was there in September, celebrating my birthday.
In principle, I liked everything about the service and quality of food: the prices are low, the portions are medium in size, so you can fill up or order again.
The only complaint is the table reservation.
When I ordered, I indicated the number and everything that was required, after which the bot immediately called to check the phone.
Nothing further.
When I arrived at the restaurant itself, it turned out that the table was not reserved.
We were lucky that there were free places and they managed to accommodate us.
And so, in fact, a very good restaurant with an excellent price/quality ratio.
I recommend!
Went for a cleaning last weekend.
For the first time I see such organized staff, who treated many of my questions with the utmost care and suggested how and what is best to do for further treatment of the dental cavity.
I wholeheartedly recommend it, the only clinic in my memory where they don’t want to waste money.
Nice shopping center.
There is everything!
Large assortment of goods.
Variety of shops.
You can always find a product you like.
From food to gifts.
Never set foot in this store again.
We bought a washing machine, they said that we were out of town, so we would take it ourselves.
the manager in the hall told me where to go to the warehouse, when asked “will they load it”? said yes. ))
at the warehouse they brought it out without a box, when asked why? They replied that this is how they load everything.
when she began to insist, they put in two strips of penoplex, like that would do!
They refused to load it into the trailer, they say it’s not their job, load it yourself, they have delivery)))
when I said that then I would refuse the order altogether, they said “whatever you want, we don’t care,” in the end one of them still condescended to go down the ramp and help his father push the car into the trailer.
This is my first time encountering such rude service.
Nice shopping center. Clean and neat. Large selection of shops and cafes and restaurants.
There is a cinema "Cosmic" and an entertainment center for children "Nevidalia".
On the ground floor there is a large Lenta Hypermarket.
Convenient, large parking, convenient location.
Good supermarket for cosmetics, underwear and household goods.
Diverse selection, reasonable prices, polite and attentive staff.
Consultants will definitely help with the choice and advise.
Everyone will find something they need.
A good place to spend an evening.
The staff is very nice, nice place.
I advise everyone to never go wrong in their choice. The best place in Krasnodar where you can relax and everything will go great.
I recommend visiting)
We express our gratitude to Marina Chasovaya, who was our funeral agent.
Having come to us on call, she took upon herself the solution of all issues related to this difficult and sad event, helped us choose everything we needed, was in touch all the time and informed us how things were going.
Thanks to her, we sent our loved one off with dignity.
Everything was formalized and clearly organized, as we discussed at the first meeting.
Marina, understanding perfectly well the state of our loved ones, gave advice on how it would be better and simply sympathized with us as a human being.
He is a very good specialist in his field.
Thanks for all.
Flattered by the many good reviews, I contacted RemStirMash and they assigned me a master, Alexander.
He began the conversation by saying that the next day he was completely free and ready for services.
We discussed everything and set a time - 14.00.
The next day came - a call in the morning from the foreman and a statement that he could not come, a complex application (how is that? Where is “completely free?”) and, if he can, then instead of the appointed 14.00 he will appear after 18.00.
We agreed again the next day.
15 minutes before the appointed time, another master calls and says that he can come instead of Alexander, but in 2 hours.
What kind of tricks are these?
A day and a half of empty waiting, all the planned things were left behind!
In short, the smart master Ivan came and fixed the breakdown, for which we thank him.
So don't be fooled by empty promises and waste your time.
The evening observations did not live up to expectations at all.
First there was a short lecture with incomprehensible material, then we looked through a telescope.
Everything was not very organized, children climbed in to watch several times, adults crowded around and could not let others watch.
The objects we looked at through the telescope were the size of an ordinary star, and can be viewed for free without a telescope.
The girl did not answer the questions very clearly, not understanding that ordinary people do not know many of the nuances.
It’s not clear why 600 rubles.
Amazing place, one of the oldest Mexican restaurants in the city, has been around since the early 2000s.
Cozy atmosphere, always friendly service.
The price tag is average.
Sit down and eat 2-3 dishes for two (portions are very large) + a cocktail, about 2500 rubles👌
There are interesting beer cocktails based on beer and tequila, for example, Macho Boracho I highly recommend trying.
Price 420 rubles for 0.5 l.
And in general, the restaurant itself has very tasty cuisine, I don’t know about others, but I really liked it, I will definitely recommend to my friends to go there)
An excellent store, I have been buying goods from them for quite a long time, since the very opening.
Good quality products.
I bought a mixer, five years have passed, and it works properly and is in good condition.
Therefore, when they did a global renovation of the apartment, they took everything they needed right here.
Excellent gas station!!!
It is located very conveniently, there is both the center and the side of the area, generally convenient)!
The quality of gas is good, I fill up 2 times a week for more than 2 years, no problems, excellent price!!!
Eaglets with a card and for cash, in terms of displacement, do not deceive.
Loved the store!
You can choose any model, at an affordable price, and for any purpose!
The staff is always ready to help you choose.
I borrowed the laptop for my daughter to study because her laptop was dead.
They helped, selected, gave a guarantee (one month) Thank you! 👍
The sommelier is working.
he helped with the choice of wine, because such a large menu is difficult to figure out on your own.
The experience of working with a sommelier is interesting, Vasily is charming, there are not enough of them in Moscow.
I ate pike perch - it was magical, respect to the chef.
Children's menu is the same as everywhere else: pasta, fries, chicken cutlets. Mine ate pizza, it's FIRE!
Adults appreciated the one with truffle, and the children liked it with ham and mushrooms.
My husband ate smoked ribs - they were the bomb, soft, juicy, flavorful.
The staff is good, everyone is smiling and friendly.
We liked.
The brand new WB pick-up point is conveniently located.
Working hours: from 10.00 to 21.00, without weekends and holidays.
There are fitting booths inside the pick-up point.
Very good place.
True professionals work here who are always ready to help.
There is also a WhatsApp group and chat for informative communication.
Fast delivery.
I’m glad that you can immediately see and try on the product.
It's great that it's close to home.
Excellent, modern hotel.
The room is spacious, very clean and comfortable.
Everything stated in the description is in stock.
Breakfast is included in the price, a large selection of dishes for every taste.
Convenient check-in, private parking near the entrance.
Solid 5.
Wonderful puppet theater.
We often go to different shows.
Today we attended the play "The Frog Princess".
At the moment, this is the best of children's performances.
It was very interesting, a lot of puppets, special effects.
Even my 14-year-old son went just for the company and said it was a very good show.
My husband and I vacationed for 10 days in January 2023.
The holiday was a "5" success, I liked everything!
I'll start in order:
On the day of arrival, they called, specified what time to expect us, gave information about the cost of the transfer (1400 from the airport), we ordered a taxi (at 23:00 the price is 850 rubles), we arrived quickly, there were no traffic jams, we were allowed through the barrier without any problems.
The administrative building is nearby, registration was done quickly, in 15-20 minutes.
All buildings have an elevator - this is a big plus!
The double room is spacious, the floors in both the room and the bathroom are warm (not heated), a huge balcony with rattan furniture (table and two chairs), panoramic windows (in building 5).
The furniture in the room is normal, there is a ladies table with a large mirror, the refrigerator is not very small, there is even a freezer.
There are a lot of green plants in building 5.
Everything is clean, towels and linen are changed at your request, but if you don’t ask to change it, they will still change it on the 4th day, the linen is of good quality.
The area is well-groomed, there are benches everywhere, clean paths, beautiful lighting in the evening.
A minibus takes you to the beach and back every 30 minutes.
5 minutes to public transport stop.
The people in the dining room are friendly and always wish you a good day.
The food is decent, but here who comes for what, everything suited us perfectly, both the choice and the quality, there was always fish and chicken and meatballs or the like, vegetables on the side every day, our own delicious pastries, more than 4 drinks, coffee beans, pancakes are always baked for breakfast, but the cheese and sausage are not very good.
The medical staff is very friendly and loyal.
We were also lucky with the weather, there was no rain, the temperature was 11-16 C°, the sun was shining.
I liked everything, I really had a rest.
There is a desire to come again and in January, when there are few vacationers)).
It’s a pity that the swimming pool and the gym complex will not be put into operation.
Thanks to the entire team of the sanatorium for their well-coordinated and high-quality work!
We've been going to Polet since August.
My daughter turned 4 in September.
She really likes everything, the coach praises her) this is the most important thing.
We go to Valeria Nikolaevna Pleshkova!)
I would never have thought that my daughter was so flexible!
Wandering through the streets of St. Petersburg, my friends and I decided to look into this promising establishment - and we were right!
The prices are very affordable, and the incredibly tasty pizza is eaten in the blink of an eye, without even a crust left.
Nice atmosphere and charming staff, in short, I recommend it :)
It just so happened that I ended up in the Tomarovskaya hospital with blood pressure and high heartbeat.
And I was extremely surprised: cleanliness, order, wet cleaning 2 times, moreover, window sills, furniture, doors were wiped down.
The food is childish, but excellent!!!
I was surprised that at 7 am they bring tea with a sandwich (bread, butter, cheese), so to speak, pre-breakfast.
The medical staff is sensitive, every single one gives both intramuscular and intravenous injections!!!
While the IV is still in place, they will come in and ask how you are feeling...
I had previously had a heart ultrasound done, but this was the first time to do this (unfortunately, I don’t know the doctor’s name, he’s a young man).
Special thanks to the attending physician Klavdiya Fedorovna Vetokhina!
A true professional: attentive, competent, gives a comprehensive answer to any question; I selected the dosage and medications, which normalized both my blood pressure and heartbeat, which I had previously been unable to achieve after consulting other doctors.
Thank you very much to the head physician Olga Vladimirovna Mevsha, who organized the coordinated work of the hospital!!!
Thanks to the medical staff, nurses, and cooks!
When visiting the customer service, the impression was good.
The administrator met me in the lobby.
Competent and polite specialists promptly and patiently help clients with all questions asked.
The specialist assisted in filing the application and provided clarification on my question.
For a small store there is a very good selection of goods.
There are semi-finished products, milk, vegetables, household chemicals, and various small items.
Open 24 hours a day, which is very convenient, always friendly staff
It’s cool when there is a place in the city where you can ride down the mountains.
The rope lifts and on weekends, of course, there is a queue for 40 seconds downhill and a 5-10 minute queue.
But overall it’s cool, immersing yourself in an atmosphere of positivity and winter, even if the roads are muddy and damp.
I contacted the service to repair my iPhone 11 pro.
The rear window was broken and the battery needed replacing.
I contacted the master Alexander directly, who explained all the details of the repair and immediately outlined the price range.
Thank you for the repair, everything was done efficiently.
The masters are very pleasant to talk to, they will show you everything and tell you everything.
However, when replacing parts, the camera was hit and the focus was lost.
I immediately reported the problem and received a quick response.
The error was corrected as soon as possible, everything works properly.
This service has good specialists with whom it is pleasant to have a dialogue.
The prices, in comparison with other services, are reasonable and affordable.
If I ever need repairs again, I will definitely contact you!
Large-scale, beautiful, atmospheric.
But, like most historical objects, its condition requires the close, prompt and high-quality attention of restorers.
Therefore, 4 and most of these stars are given to the creators, not the owners
Excellent w/c
Responsive concierges, garbage is removed, the area is clean and beautiful, close to bus stops, schools and shops.
20 minutes to the metro by public transport
We opened a nice, cozy place to relax in our area.
There are all the necessary shops.
A killer and varied food court.
The tables are located in cozy areas.
No crowding.
Well, we visited and tried...
The interior has nothing in common with an Italian cozy cafe...
There is very little space, the tables are rectangular, like in a dining room.
Pizza... well, anyone who hasn’t tasted it better will like it. I thought it was kind of faceless.
I didn’t really like the fact that the waiter always stands behind you and almost always looks your interlocutor in the face.
We felt uncomfortable.
Connolly, yes, delicious.
We won't come here again and won't recommend it to my friends.
Lena Grosskopf is the best hairdresser I have ever had my hair cut and dyed with.
She does everything very carefully and efficiently, I am happy to go to her, I understand that everything will be done perfectly.
I also take my daughter only to Lena.
The atmosphere of the salon is amazing.
Thanks a lot!
We were from Nizhny, we broke down on the way, the kind people from KatResource quickly responded and helped!
Respect to you and prosperity, if only there were more such good people!
And the service there is clean and good!
We came to the concert of Sergei Chigrakov.
Excellent concert venue, wonderful sound and atmosphere.
We will definitely come this year to the planned concerts.
Calm place, wonderful Georgian restaurant, live music on weekends and holidays!
The staff is pleasant and responsive!
There is a children's room.
Amazing Georgian cuisine!
The highest rating, I love this place ❤
The park is in the city center, very easy to get to.
The park is clean, there is room for both children and adults.
But there has been no sand on the playground for a long time, only dust remains.
There is also a fenced football field, which, unfortunately, is not very well maintained.
But there are still more advantages in our park.
Spacious room, clean, clear layout of goods.
There are products that can only be bought at Perekrestok.
The staff is welcoming.
I didn’t come across any bad products.
Often promotions and discounts.
I'm glad it's close to home.
You can always find a parking space.
We visited the bar twice, we liked everything, polite staff, delicious dishes and most importantly - great music, the DJs know their stuff.
The only thing is that for the second time the lead singer of the “Hands Up Band” group disappoints.
Not only does he not sing very well, to put it mildly, but he also reads the lyrics of most songs from his phone, which was especially striking when they were songs by the group “Hands Up”.
Somehow this is illogical (performing in the Ruki Up Bar, in the Ruki Up Band group).
We vacationed at the beginning of March.
Nice hotel, nice rooms.
In honor of my birthday, we were given a room with a view of the Kremlin.
Room cleaning every day.
Replenishment of water, tea, coffee, shampoo and change of towels.
The breakfasts are just mind blowing.
There is a mini bar with crazy prices.
If you want to order food from a restaurant to your room, pay 20% extra for service.
The prices in the restaurant are a little high.
The taste is a three plus.
The water park was included in the price.
The water park itself cannot be called the best in Russia.
But the massage therapist was just a bomb.
Everything is fine, but the departure was a little disappointing: no goodbye, no good road.
The employee at the entrance didn’t even help open the door, seeing women with a bunch of bags and suitcases.
You need to work on this to maintain your brand.
A great place to get together with friends to take a steam bath.
Large and comfortable steam room, billiards, outdoor pool, karaoke.
The food is delicious, the drinks are fresh)
Workshop on the level!
In a short time I have already repaired 3 pairs of shoes (2 husbands and 1 wife).
Everything is fine.
The quality of work is excellent.
Special thanks to the master for his caring attitude and quality of work!
Wonderful basketball school!
My son has been going for 5 months and he really likes it and looks forward to every training session.
Individual approach to children, interesting activities, warm and sincere atmosphere.
The store is excellent, the staff will go, I order online myself.
Great store location.
Plus there are always discounts and promotions, which is also good
A good AB store - convenient location, large hall, good selection.
Special thanks to the staff for their responsiveness!
There is a cafeteria with several tables.
I come often - everything suits me!
Nice pool!
I’m specifically talking about the “frog”, our coach Anastasia Vitalievna really likes the child and is professional!!
The locker rooms are clean, the water is warm, and there are hair dryers!
I love cupcake bakeries, service, croissants, breakfasts and coffee are always top notch.
But alas, not this time, I ordered coffee and a couple of croissants, the girls at the checkout didn’t make the coffee until I reminded them, they did, it’s impossible to drink, it stinks and the aftertaste of spoiled milk remains, I decided not to finish it and just left.
Last time there was a long black hair in my coffee, they replaced it.
Please be more careful, after all, I am a guest returning here, even after such incidents.
Gorgeous eyebrows are here!
Victoria makes excellent corrections, taking into account all facial proportions individually.
Correction with warm wax, which removes all the fluff well, and the eyebrows look neat for a long time.
The color is selected according to the type of hair and skin, so the dye lasts a long time.
There's no better way to do your eyebrows!
Thank you very much for organizing my mom's move!
Moving is always a huge stress, but with your company everything went very smoothly, quickly, and efficiently.
Special thanks to Vadim and Roman!
I will recommend your company to all my friends!
All at the highest level.
Our whole family has been treating our teeth at Novodent for a long time.
We recently had our 8-year-old son’s teeth treated, everything went just fine, the child is calm and ready to come again.
You don't have to wait long, there are no queues because... reception by appointment.
For me, the most delicious shawarma in Tambov is only here, I’m not a shawarma fan, BUT when you want something unhealthy, only here and only here.
Delicious, fresh meat, lots of filling.
And I don’t understand why, but it never flows for me.
Often, when you finish eating the shawarma, you don’t eat the bottom anymore because there’s a lot of sauce and water, well, in short, ugh...., but not here.
That's why you guys are the best 🙂
Good teaching staff.
The food in the dining room is always fresh.
Interesting lessons in the school museum, various events are held throughout the school year
Nice store, polite employees, good selection.
However, the big minus is that the goods that are delivered are apparently destroyed right on the sales floor.
Sometimes there is not enough space to walk between the rows, and it is also not very pleasant when the goods are standing directly on the floor, without pallets, but this is more of a remark to the organization, and not to a specific store
A delightful example of Soviet architecture.
Austere splendor, carefully cared for.
I double enjoyed the concert, largely thanks to the atmosphere of the cultural center.
While we were waiting for the start in the hall, I clearly felt that I had come to the Event, that this was really a coming out.
I was looking for a clutch kit for my MB Sprinter.
I came across this online auto parts store quite by accident.
I called, indicated the Vincode, they said wait)
About 10 minutes later they called back and offered several options.
Since the car is a personal work car, I didn’t save money and asked to order a good LUK clutch kit.
After another 5 minutes they called back and said that there was good news for you.
If you don’t take the entire basket + disc + release, but take a LUK basket + disc set and a separate LUK release, it will be 2 thousand rubles cheaper, which could not please.
I picked up the clutch and went to the service center.
When removing the gearbox, it was discovered that a flywheel was still needed, and the sooner the better.
I already knew where I would go), the manager understood the situation and ordered without prepayment by calling (for the first time I also paid upon receipt).
The next day the flywheel was in hand.
The car is happy with the new flywheel and clutch, I’m happy that everything arrived quickly, that they went to the meeting.
I will definitely recommend and contact vinkod.shop
The New Year's party was a great success, but with some nuances.
I booked a table for two, but it turned out they seated me at a table for four.
But no problem.
It's just strange that they didn't warn me.
The kitchen was a B, the fish was not a success at all.
The presenter with competitions made at a school-level powerpoint, to be honest, not very good.
BUT regarding the music everything is perfect.
The atmosphere was great.
Everything else seems like nitpicking.
Thank you for the event
I leave my review with words of gratitude to all the staff of maternity hospital number 7 in Chelyabinsk.
This institution employs only people who know and love their work, doctors and nurses from God.
Both in the OPB department, and in the maternity ward, and in the postpartum ward.
But I express special gratitude to E.Yu. Kotlyarova, this is the head of the maternity ward on the 5th floor, and N.V. Yarantseva, this is the midwife in the maternity ward, thank you very much for your help at the birth of my daughter, for your kind heart, for your great professionalism.
Wonderful store.
Large assortment of balloons, always fast order formation and delivery.
Professional staff.
Very beautiful bouquets, always left with great taste, always fresh flowers.
We visited the establishment on a recommendation.
The food is amazing, there is no program, the waiters are a little impudent, but we were in a great group with children and were celebrating an important event, they were friendly.
There was no fiery supply to the plateau, the children were waiting.
You can safely go for good cuisine.
