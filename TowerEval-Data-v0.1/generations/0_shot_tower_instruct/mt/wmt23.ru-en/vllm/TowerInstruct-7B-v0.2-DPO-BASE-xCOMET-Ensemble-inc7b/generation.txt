The July issue is traditionally published during the Moscow Film Festival, and this is certainly very sad: reading the paper when you’re dying to see Shabrodin.
However, we will talk about the MMKF next time (for now, I will just complain that this year, the organizers' understanding of the importance of happy ticket-buyers has become firmly entrenched in their minds, a ridiculous and highly offensive principle that no other normal film festival in the world adheres to), and in this issue, we will report on what we saw in Cannes and at the Kinotavr festival.
The cover of the July issue features another likable face – the main character from the film “Predators”, produced by Robert Rodriguez – and inside the magazine you’ll definitely want to read the article about “The Beginning” by Christopher Nolan (the man who, among other things, rebooted the “Batman” franchise), the most highly anticipated film of the summer.
In addition, this time we are publishing the first part of a fairly detailed guide to the works of Alfred Hitchcock, and in this case there is really no need to promote anything in particular, and it is clear to me that the author of "Suspicion" and "Rope" is our Tatyana Aleshicheva, Boris Gleyzerov, Anna Golovnaya, Nick de Semlin, Dan Joling, Tamara Dondurey, Nikolai Karayev, Denis Korsakov, Maria Kuvshinnova, Ivan Kulikov, Will Lawrence, Sergey Mезенov, Sergey Natapov, Ian Nathan, Kim Newman, Zaira Ozova, Nev Pierce, Alexei Prostiakov, Seraphima Skibyuk, Adam Smith, Mura Soboleva, Vasily Stepanov, Alexander Strelkov, Ollie Richards, Oleg Tishchenkov, Alena Logunova, Chris Hewitt, and Olga Shakina, the London-based editor Evelyn Salt, despite her impressive resume, were suspected of spying for the Russians and were determined to catch them at all costs.
Cornered, it will change its color to the familiar black and set out on its own to find the truth.
Another action film with Angelina Jolie in the role of a seductive femme fatale promises to further solidify the actress’s position in the action genre.
She will cause one accident after another, run around walls like in The Matrix and knock over burly men in identical strict suits like a child.
That is how beauty should save the world.
Here he is, the native son who blew up and fixed the world with "The Fifth Element" and made Milla Jovovich the most beautiful woman in the universe.
For Bruce Willis, he was the quintessential superhero guy, and Gary Oldman was the most stylish and impeccable embodiment of Evil.
And yet, all together, it didn’t come across as a tedious American-style blockbuster about saving humanity, but rather as a delightful living carnival.
I don’t really want to dwell on what Besson was doing for 13 years between Elementary Particles... and Adele H.
To put it mildly, he didn’t have nothing to do, but all this fuss over the script and production, as well as his rare, forced performances as a director, will be forgotten.
As for “Adele...”, that is hardly the case.
When watching this film, it seems as though the 13-year-old we see is not our own Besson, but some kind of doppelganger.
As for himself, the real one, he lived in a small apartment in Montmartre, drank wine in a café across the street, and wrote a story about an alluring adventurer.
Retelling the plot (even in broad strokes) while stirring up expectations is more wrong than usual in this case.
The incredible excitement here lies in the fact that surprises await you around every corner or after every line of dialogue.
And they are all pleasant.
Whether it was a girl or a vision.
UNUSUAL ASSOCIATIONS OF ADELLE
The most exciting adventure film of the decade hints that The Extraordinary Adventures of Adèle will start out like Amélie, head in the direction of Jurassic Park, continue with Indiana Jones and The Mummy, and end with Titanic.
The film is based on the first volume of Jacques Tardi’s comic book series about journalist Adèle Blanc-Sec.
Louise Bourgoin, before Adèle, appeared in only three films.
The actress became famous for her role in “The Girl from Monaco”, for which she was nominated for a Cesar Award.
The director doesn’t run after the audience with outstretched arms, begging them to appreciate the special effects, sets or stunts, but rather captivates them, like an old-fashioned novelist exclaiming before setting out on a great journey to the centre of the earth or to the ends of the world: “Come with me, my reader, great things await us!”
At the same time, Leos Carax approaches genre cinema, which he knows everything about, with impudence and humor, like a boy who has watched old films and read Jules Verne.
Manipulating banalities, not denying oneself cynicism and not being shy about taking risks
Director: Luc Besson
IN THE ROLES: Louise Bourgoin, Mathieu Amalric, Frédéric Beigbeder, Gilles Lellouche
SYNOPSIS: Strange things were happening in Paris in 1912.
The city was thrown into a state of turmoil by an ancient monster that an old medium had brought back to life.
The police are chasing after the fossilized animal, as well as a famous hunter, a couple of scientists from the natural history museum, and journalist Adele Blanc-Sec, who has a mission not so much to save the animal itself, but to save her sister, who is a medium.
For the same purpose, the girl is bringing a real mummy from Egypt.
RELEASE DATE: JULY 22nd.
“Adele...” is an example of a parody that becomes the pinnacle of the genre and is capable of radically changing it, by pointing it in a new direction.
This was the case with Sergio Leone’s spaghetti westerns, with Quentin Tarantino’s gangster films, with the aforementioned “Indiana Jones” (they paid tribute to it and also made fun of it), and finally, with “The Fifth Element”.
Bézian’s style in this film is made up of verbal trickery, actorly clowning, and narrative acrobatics (circus terms are entirely appropriate here, as the union of the two arts is organic and stronger than ever).
A few words should also be said about Adele herself.
It embodies a type of adventuress that has been unfairly forgotten, one who is motivated not so much by the exploitation of sexuality as by pure courage and daring.
In movies, such girls are usually paired with some hapless macho or a clueless romantic.
TEXT: ALEXANDER STRELKOV
Face to face with history
There is only a timid and comical admirer present, who only bustles about (his knowledge of zoology is the only thing that proves useful).
That’s why this energetic girl doesn’t waste time on trivial matters of the heart, but rather spends her time having fun in the company of ancient corpses, which, by the way, play a key role in the plot.
Luc Besson, who has become accustomed to numerous genre films and seemed to have lost his creative edge, showed unexpected creativity, reminding us that the line between the preferences of bored visitors to megaplexes and the discerning patrons of art house cinemas can easily be crossed with films for cheerful eccentrics.
A game of adventure cinema without sadness, fear, or reproach
ROOM OF DEATH
This horror film, which aims for psychological depth and a political context, Jonathan Liebesman’s debut horror film from 2002 was panned by critics, but was well-received by audiences and did well at the box office, and most importantly, caught the eye of producer Michael Bay.
This is how the young director ended up at a factory churning out new horror films based on old formulas: Bay set himself the goal of re-filming the entire classic horror canon as remakes, and tasked Liebesman with directing the prequel to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2006).
Critics rolled their eyes again, but the public loved it once more—Liberman worked in the spirit of the “new horrors”, which emphasize the excessive physicality of violence.
In fact, you can see the whole genre convulsing in its efforts to come up with new ways to affect an over-saturated audience, with the gory splatter of the naturalistic splatter films merging with the chase scenes of slasher films.
The plot is reminiscent of the “Saw” franchise, but without the gallons of blood.
Among the prototypes is Vincente Natali’s debut film, “Cube”, which was not directed by Michael Bay.
So, in Room of Death, Libesman had to take a different approach: instead of a senseless massacre or a monotonous chase by a maniac, he preferred a more intelligent approach—almost without the usual bloodshed, but with psychological games and puzzles.
The evil doctors here play a game of cat and mouse with their test subjects.
Meanwhile, three men trapped in a locked room are trying to come up with a survival strategy: should they band together or shoot each other?
Playing by the rules and obeying orders from outside?
Or try to break out of their cage at any cost?
They are not the only ones being tested; a young, ambitious employee of the intelligence agency is also being put to the test by an experienced professor who is a master of cruel experiments.
SCENARIO: For $250, four volunteers sign up for a simple test.
They are put in an isolated room and each is given a stack of pages with meaningless questions.
Then a polite man in a white coat enters the room, introduces himself as a doctor, and shoots one of the test subjects in the head.
A game of survival begins, which government agents closely monitor through the window.
Too contemplative for a horror film, but not enough for an outright art house film
He can engage in polite conversation and drive a fire extinguisher around, but he cannot help but notice every skirt.
On the other hand, the charming Nastya is very selective and unyielding when it comes to her affections.
She is offended by her father's cavalier lifestyle and openly watches as he dives into the pool in search of his next romantic victim, as if parodying the famous scene from Paul Verhoeven's Showgirls.
The daughter rebels, while the father tempts her young suitor from a poor family with money.
But the main topic of the family conflict is not the generation gap or the choice of profession, which has already been more or less predetermined, but rather the unsuccessful attempts by the girl to refute the obvious idea that in modern-day Moscow everything can be bought and sold.
Mher Mkrtchan, along with Pavel Bardin, directed a comedy film titled “Three and a Snowflake” starring Ivan Ugryantsev. This was a lacklustre melodrama.
Depardieu convincingly portrayed the father of a growing daughter in a comedy genre film.
The fragmented plot revolves around the love affairs of the characters, who are constantly talking about psychology, while themselves, apparently due to the witty directorial decision, focus on the language of gaze and gesture.
The secondary storylines (the girl who was injured in a car accident and whom Alexei wants to marry, the alcoholic athlete played by Sergei Gorobchenko) are, alas, only sketched out.
It is particularly unfortunate that the line about the business of buying up football players was left on the cutting room floor.
SYNOPSIS: The fate of his underage daughter Nastya is of utmost concern to the agent specializing in selling football stars.
The good-hearted father himself changes girlfriends like expensive shirts, but his daughter is about to turn eighteen and she absolutely must marry a guy with “character”.
How disappointing it must be for the businessman when, in her struggle for independence and in defiance of her father, Nastya chooses a peer and business partner.
On the other hand, with the potential slogan for the film’s audience, the author hit the mark: “Don’t look for trouble where there is none”. That’s more accurate.
Their resemblance is simply striking.
In both films, there are groups of tough guys, lucky soldiers, who are forced to take revenge on those who betrayed them, and in each company there is one beautiful girl.
The heroes race through practically the same parts of the world (both films begin in Latin America and end in the port of Los Angeles) and make use of the same spectacular footage – in both cases, something stuffed with dollar bills explodes and a whirlwind of bills descends upon the set.
Even the villains, dressed in expensive costumes, are not easy to distinguish from one another (they are played by both Patrick brothers—Jason Patrick here, Patrick Wilson there).
Zoe Saldana’s previous role was as Neytiri in Avatar.
Sylvain White used to shoot dance battles for the show “Dance Squad”.
Chris Evans was recently asked to play the hero in other comic books: he will be Captain America.
The director Sylvain White was inspired by a series of comics that were published in the 1970s and were rebooted in the 2000s, while Joe Cornish was inspired by a comedy series from the 1980s.
It’s simply amazing how, without coordinating with each other, they managed to bring different materials to an absolutely identical, explosive conclusion, creating rather heavy, predictable, and unnecessary action flicks that evoke a multitude of memories associated with Willis and Schwarzenegger (comparisons invariably favour Bruce and Arnold).
If we have to choose between these two films, then ‘Losers’ looks slightly more appealing and is clearly more successful in terms of efficiency (after all, the budget is three and a half times smaller).
At least there’s Zoe Saldana, who looks great in a bikini.
IN THEIR ROLES: Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Zoey Saldana, Chris Evans, Patrick Wilson, Idris Elba, Columbus Short
SYNOPSIS: During an operation in the Bolivian jungle, a group of experienced commandos working for the CIA were betrayed by their own superiors: the helicopter carrying the children they were trying to rescue was blown up, and the soldiers themselves were considered dead from that moment on.
But they are still alive, and they intend to take revenge on the scoundrel with the deep voice who orchestrated the whole thing.
All of this is nice, but, to be honest, it's only worth spending an hour and a half of your life on a White film if you have absolutely no other options.
Made from recycled materials, a conditionally edible maggot larvae.
A simple story about a Romanian convict on the run
A Romanian low-budget film that won an award at a prestigious international film festival.
In principle, with only these data to go on, it is possible to imagine the hypothetical content of the painting and even some of its specific details.
Without a doubt, the movie promises to be highly topical.
Of course, it will be realistic, and quite tough at that.
There is a high probability of the participation of non-professional actors.
The film will also feature a lot of Romanian poverty (yes, poverty knows no nationality, but Romanian poverty, as our festival winners have proven time and time again, is particularly dire).
Also, without knowing the year of release, one could easily mistake what is happening on screen for the activities of some underground, critical realists from the countries of the Warsaw Pact, who in the early 1980s were given a lecture on Bresson.
The film won the Grand Prize of the Jury at the Berlin International Film Festival.
The script is based on a play by Andrea Vaillant, whose work is in particularly high demand among directors of the Romanian “new wave”.
The operator Marius Panduru often works with Corneliu Porumbău.
All of the above is true for the debut work of Florin Serban as well, and—make no mistake—is meant as a recommendation rather than a criticism: the Romanian “new wave” is at that blissful stage of development where its representatives have faith in their methods.
Her work has not yet been shaken.
And this is the moment you need to seize: it is only thanks to this faith that you can endure the one and a half hour spectacle of the Romanian juvenile detention facility and surrender to the charisma of the talented Pistéranean (whose story, despite the chasm separating the two cultures, is truly remarkable).
convert it into an exploitation film à la 1970s, with a cowboy who decides to walk from the prison from which he is about to be released to the nearest bar).
IN THE ROLES: Georg Pistaueran, Adina Condescu, Mihai Constantin, Clara Voda, Marian Bratu
SYNOPSIS: After serving his four-year sentence, the 18-year-old convict Silviu (Pistăreanu) is about to be released, but suddenly finds out that his mother wants to take his younger brother with her to Italy.
From that point on, the young man’s behavior becomes inappropriate.
His flirtation with social worker Anna drives the guy to even more desperate acts, the meaning of which is summed up in the title of the film.
What a load of nonsense!
If you want to watch it, watch it.
A decent debut that gives us faint hope that Romanian arthouse cinema will one day develop into a respectable genre
A cartoon about the joys of villainy and family life
The directorial debut of a man named Grob (Sop) and his co-author Reno was made under the auspices of producer Christopher Meledandri, the grey cardinal of American animation, responsible, among other things, for all the Ice Age, Horton, and Robots films.
“UglyDolls” is probably the best work of his team: the film is beautifully drawn (by the way, it’s worth watching it in 3D), especially if you like it when different objects keep jumping out of the screen and into the theater), the script is well written, and most importantly, there isn’t a single fart joke in it, which in “Ice Age” forced people to hide their faces in their seats and cover their children’s ears.
It is clear that the reason for the change in direction was not the authors' sense of proportion, but the glaring asexuality of the main character, which in turn was dictated by the unwillingness to touch upon the topic of pedophilia in any way whatsoever.
For the “adult” part, aside from the main conflict involving single fatherhood, there is a fairly harsh brand of black humor (which, one hopes, we owe to director Coffin).
Overall, this is a very likable movie – so much so that at times it feels almost too perfect and polished.
One can sense the hard work of a well-coordinated team of marketers who thought through every detail in order for the film to appeal to all categories of citizens.
Not that we wanted to see childhood cartoon characters being eaten by cannibals or destroyed by an atomic explosion
SYNOPSIS: The snouty villain Gru, whose childhood dreams of becoming an astronaut have evolved over the years into a plan to steal the moon, enlists the help of children in order to carry out his grand scheme and eliminate a young competitor.
In some sort of advanced orphanage, he adopts three female orphans—Margo in glasses, Edith in a hat, and Agnes, as adorable as a kitten from Shrek.
As is usually the case, children immediately change the plans of adults.
The main character is based on Christopher Meloni – they are both bald, big-nosed, and have a penchant for black humor.
In the original, the main characters were voiced by Steve Carell and Jason Segel.
In the final, Grush dances Travolta’s part.
A van pulls up to an abandoned trailer in the middle of a hypothetical desert, and three pairs of the finest babes step out.
That is correct.
The carriers of this gift themselves are not so significant.
The camera confidently focuses on this part of the body.
For those who are fans, we have some good news to share – the entire film is in the same vein.
Rick Jacobson understands women’s beauty in its purest form, and he conducted the casting in such a way that what happens on screen is of secondary importance.
And a lot of fun things happen.
The “broker”, the “killer”, and the “stripteaser” dig in the sand, get doused with water (don’t ask why), put up with some kind of ordeal, and periodically engage in fierce fights.
The creators believe that a pregnant sow with generous curves, covered in mud and with a broken nose and gleaming white teeth, is cool.
“Saucy things” are primarily aimed at classic sexploitation films.
Rick Jacobson directed episodes of "Zena: Warrior Princess" and "The Legend of Hercules".
A film with a similar spirit that is currently showing in Moscow is “A Stake for Jennifer”.
It’s also cool when a bitchy beauty cooks eggs for a gangster, a beaten-up punk fights alongside a Japanese schoolgirl, a samurai sword and lesbian sex are thrown in; and the plot unfolds through an endless number of flashbacks.
In general, movie fetishists will find a real treasure trove of pleasures here.
Of course, it's clear that Jacobson and his gang were having a blast making this trash parody, but the task itself seems rather strange.
If it weren’t for the physical attributes of the actresses, it would have become boring by the middle of the film.
It’s possible that this wildlife came to us from the adults-only late-night channel (Jacobson, by the way, often takes on roles in TV series).
IN THE ROLES: Julia Whelan, Erin Cummings, America Olivo, Michael Hurst, Ron Melendez
SYNOPSIS: Three dangerous beauties bring a mafia boss into the desert, where he has hidden diamonds worth a substantial sum of money.
After failing to achieve anything and having shot the unfortunate bandit, the women start fighting with each other and with the hoodlums who keep showing up out of nowhere, as well as kissing and hugging each other regularly.
As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that all three are not who they appeared to be at the beginning.
Apparently, according to the author, it’s even funnier that way.
A product for a select group of enthusiasts of terrible mispronunciation.
Yes, with his latest film, "Doomsday," the disillusioned "Mad Max" for the destitute, Marshall has made a serious misstep
The bloodthirsty and biting Peplum returns the director’s shaky trust.
This new politically incorrect and brooding magnum opus makes no apologies for its modest budget, obvious sources of inspiration, and fierce B-movie aesthetic.
The film also features the hooligan antics of the “Dog Warriors” and the savage brutality of “The Descent”.
The “Marshall Plan” for cleaning up the “peplum” genre from the post-gladiatorial film trash that accumulated over time, generally worked.
In 2011, Kevin McDonald will present his interpretation of the story of the Ninth Legion.
His battle-scarred legionaries (among others, the unexpectedly colourful David Morrissey and Liam Cunningham) are tough guys trying to reconcile their military duty with an overwhelming desire to survive.
Murder and the juicy details of bodily functions in ancient times are depicted here with love and attention to detail.
The scene of the extermination of the Ninth Legion, which required a lot of budget money, is directly inspired by the opening sequence in the German forests from Sir Ridley Scott’s now classic “Gladiator”, but one doesn’t really want to accuse Marshall of plagiarism: he works honestly and without complaint.
IN THE ROLES: Michael Fassbender, Olga Kurylenko, Dominic West, Liam Cunningham, David Morrissey
SCENARIO: The lands of modern Scotland, occupied by the Holy Roman Empire.
The remote outpost where Centurion Quintus Diaz (Fassbender) serves is mercilessly overrun by a Pict scouting party.
The lucky Diaz is forced to first join the infamous Ninth Legion, and then, along with a group of other surviving Romans, attempt to escape from a group of Pict warriors led by the sadistic Iténe (Kurilenko).
So far, the art-house actor has only managed to secure small, character-driven roles in Hollywood, but it’s hard not to hope that things will change after Centurion.
Peplum — an edition that has been corrected and expanded.
Almost like “Gladiator”, only more modest and harsher
This is a continuation of the story about the schoolgirl Bella (Kristen Stewart) and her complicated relationships with two highly promising young men – the pale-faced vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and the werewolf-culture vulture Jacob (Taylor Lautner).
Pattinson's fans held their breath.

Take note of George Clooney, who teamed up with rock photographer-turned-filmmaker Anton Corbijn ("Control") for a curiously existential exploration of the psychology of an aging hitman hiding out in a small Italian town and coming to grips with human nature late in life.
“The visionary artist of Corbijn’s calibre and the magnificent George Clooney are a cinematic union forged in heaven”, boasts the studio press release.
Moreover, this project is yet another confirmation of Clooney’s longest-lasting love affair in life – with Italy: the filming took place in the picturesque town of Castel del Monte in Abruzzo.
Taking Martin Booth’s novel A Very Private Gentleman as a basis, Rowan Joffe made some changes to the script: the role of the English narrator was taken by an American, and the protagonist, who was once an illegal arms dealer, was transformed into a simple assassin.
For the rest, the story is close to the original: while hitman Jack tries to wrap up his last job and finally retire from his lucrative profession, his icy heart melts under the charm of a local priest (Paolo Bonacelli) and a street prostitute (Tecla Ruten) whom the character played by Clooney falls in love with instantly.
“Jack tempts fate”, says the official synopsis.
A dangerous messenger of darkness is getting closer and closer to him, and the mysterious lady who hires him may very well not be who she claims to be.”
Judging by the trailer, Corbijn’s visual experiments, seasoned with Clooney’s grizzled hair (the film is like a long music video), have reached a qualitatively new level.
Daniel Radcliffe will play the lead role in the film adaptation of Remarque’s “All Quiet on the Western Front”
Or maybe I could shoot you with a rifle!?
This season, Johnny Depp could be seen in two places at once.
Firstly, in Venice, on the set of the thriller “Tourist” by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck (“The Lives of Others”).
There, he plays a tourist in love with the character played by Angelina Jolie.
Secondly, in Puerto Rico, at the “Rum Diary” filming location, an adaptation of the debut novel by the legendary Hunter S. Thompson.
The director and screenwriter for the project is Bruce Robinson (“Withnail and I”), whose last directorial work was the thriller “Jennifer 8” in 1992.
Looking at the work of the poster artists of domestic prison dramas, one might not even doubt what inspired them.
But we can’t approach the matter of implementing this idea in a literal sense!
However, at least it’s good that the heroine of the Russian film, even though she’s a foreigner, isn’t completely bald.

They have already completed four joint projects: ‘The Gilmore Girls’, ‘Big Daddy’, ‘Chuck and Larry: Father of the Bride’, and ‘Don’t Mess with Zohan!’.
In July, the fifth comedy will be released – ‘Classmates’ – and the sixth is currently in production – ‘The Hypnotist’s Wife’, starring Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman.
The schedule also includes the seventh film—the romantic comedy Jack and Jill, in which Sandler will play both Jack and his twin sister Jill.
Matthew Vaughn, who impressed audiences this year with the action-packed film “Kick-Ass”, will be in charge of rebooting the X-Men franchise.
In the film X-Men: First Class, the director first cast James McAvoy in the role of a young Professor X.
Rosamund Pike will play the telepathic mutant Emma Frost, also known as the White Queen, Amber Heard will transform into the blue-skinned Mystique, and Michael Fassbender will presumably become Magneto.
While the filming of the new installment in the Bond franchise is delayed, its new director Sam Mendes doesn't have time to be bored.
His upcoming projects include the musical “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” and the screen adaptation of Ishmael McEwan’s novel “On the Beach”.
The author adapts the script himself.
Carey Mulligan has been offered the lead female role.
Gary Oldman is considering the role of the practical Major George Smiley, the main character in a series of novels by John Le Carré, in the film adaptation of the thriller Spy Game.
In the first adaptation of this work, in 1979, Alec Guinness played the lead role.
The new version will be directed by the Danish director Thomas Alfredson, creator of the horror film “Let Me In”.
Tom Tykwer is adapting the fantasy bestseller novel “Cloud Atlas” by David Mitchell.
According to the director, this is not an easy task (there are six parallel storylines in the novel), but it is a highly interesting project.
He has already received offers from Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, James McAvoy, Ian McKellen, and Natalie Portman.
Filming is underway in Crimea for the international action film directed by Maksim Korostyshevsky under the working title "Soldiers of Fortune".
It is dedicated to millionaires who went to a real war in search of adrenaline, all in the name of their money.
The cast includes Christian Slater, Sean Bean, Ving Rhames, Dominic Monaghan, Oksana Korolyevskaya, and others.
The film is scheduled for release at the beginning of 2011.
Sam Rockwell will star in the comedy film “Baby Jesus” alongside British pop star Pixie Lott
Megan Fox was fired from Transformers 3.
As the Ragottipe film company assures us, the dismissal was “not connected with that interview in which Fox compared Michael Bay to Hitler”.
Nonetheless, the main role of the heroine and new love interest of Shia LaBeouf's character will most likely be played by the English model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.
The girl has no experience in film, so she will have to attend an accelerated acting course.
This fact should not be intimidating to discerning viewers – there are plenty of examples throughout the history of cinema of successful retraining of models into actresses.
Charlize Theron ("Monster"), Angelina Jolie ("Life or Something Like It"), Jessica Lang ("Happy Feet", "Tutsi"), Kim Basinger ("L.A. Confidential"), Jennifer Connelly ("Requiem for a Dream"), Gina Davis ("The Accidental Tourist") and Halle Berry ("Monsters Ball"), who was the first runner-up in the Miss USA pageant, started out as models or worked for fashion magazines, and eventually received an Oscar.
They excelled in acting (also the beauties Milla Jovovich, Cameron Diaz, Monica Bellucci, and, most pleasingly, our compatriot Olga Kurilenko.
High honours are clearly within their reach.
In short, Rose has someone to look up to.
Valeria Gaï Germakina, who received Special Mention from the Cannes jury in 2008 for the film All Will Die and I Shall Remain, and directed the scandalous television series School, has been appointed creative director at the television channel MT.
The management of the channel believes that Valeriya will be able to bring about the desired and necessary changes.
In particular, they are already planning to shoot their own series (about teenagers or vampires).
Germania has also started casting for new hosts.
The comedy film “Kolotilov” directed by Leo Gabriadze and produced by Timur Bekmambetov unexpectedly turned into “Vykrutasy”.
The main theme of the film remains the same – provincial Russian language teacher Slava Kolotilov (Konstantin Khabensky) is rushing to Moscow to meet his fiancée, but gets delayed in order to coach a team of street children playing football.
A second storyline in the film has received a new development.
Instead of actress Elena Plaskina, the role of the capital city bride Nadya will be played by Mila Jovovich.
A third character will appear as an additional element of intrigue – Nadia’s former fiancé Danya (played by Ivan Ugryantsev).
Thus, in addition to the question of whether the neighbourhood team will win the football championship, there is also the dilemma of who will get Mila Jovovich.
Due to the constant delays in filming The Hobbit and the large number of side projects, Guillermo del Toro declined the position of director.
The studios are trying to convince producer Peter Jackson to take full control of the project, but he is only willing to agree to this step if absolutely necessary.
Possible successors mentioned are David Yates, who completed filming of the Harry Potter saga, and Neil Blomkamp, whose film, District 9, produced by Jackson, was nominated for an Oscar.
The official name of the new director will be announced at the next SOTS-SOP convention at the end of July.
Angelina Jolie will play Cleopatra
Overwhelmed by a gruelling schedule of events, critics and filmmakers rushed around between the Sochi Winter Theatre, where screenings with master classes were held, and the Zhemchugnaya Hotel, where press conferences and roundtable discussions were held one after the other, barely finding time to dive into the Black Sea.
The heroes of the competition films behaved in a similar way – in practically every film someone runs away: the bewildered Asians from Yusup Razyakov’s “Gastarbeiter” and Dmitry Mamulia’s “Druggo neba” searched for a missing grandson and wife, and the fugitive bandit from Yuri Bykov’s film “Zhit’”
The same cops were happily waved off by the hero of Klim Shipenko’s detective story “Who Am I?”—which, however, was remembered by the public more for the presence in the frame of the totally naked Jeanne Friske.
There were appearances by heroes of the domestic show business scene, and in a couple of competitive films as well – in the film “Slon” [Elephant], Sergey Shnurov played a long-distance truck driver transporting a circus animal to be slaughtered, while Evgeny Grishkovetsky mused on his favourite topics – female betrayal, male loneliness, the healing power of alcohol – in the film “Satisfaction”, where business partners challenged each other to drinking duels over a woman.
However, even the business events at the "Kinotavr" film festival had a distinct showbiz flavor—there was never a dull moment.
At a roundtable discussion on the fate of Russian arthouse cinema, the chairman of the fund for supporting domestic cinema, Sergei Tolstikov, engaged in a verbal sparring match with critics: “Do you even read the articles in the press that I read?” he sternly asked those in attendance.
“I write them myself”, the president of ERVEZS! Andrei Plakhov replied, looking confused.
The scandals didn’t end there: towards the end of the festival, Alexei Fedorchenko’s film “Ovseyanki” was suddenly removed from the competition program – it will go to Venice instead: the selection committee of Mostra decided that an additional Russian screening would be a hindrance to them.
Previously, ‘Kinotavr’ didn’t interfere with the giants – films from major festivals have been shown in Sochi on numerous occasions: this time, for example, Sergei Loznitsa’s ‘My Happy Family’ was in the competition, which in the spring competed with Mikhalkov and Virasakun’s films on the Côte d’Azur.
At the ‘Kinotavr’ festival, Nikita Sergeevich watched a film by a former competitor from Cannes and declared that he liked it.
On the contrary, the chairman of the jury Karen Shakhnazarov did not like Loznitsa’s film at all – but under pressure from his colleagues he was forced to give her the award for direction.
The award for best debut film, “The Missing,” was won by her daughter.
A terrifying cinematic encyclopedia of Russian life: naive, humane, and rational heroes are beaten, robbed, and provoked into committing monstrous acts without any apparent motive.
A precisely executed, thought-provoking film experiment, created by a misanthrope with a background in mathematics, which calls for only one thing: start thinking.
A debutant with a philosophical education, Mamulia calls his films quotes from Mammardashvili, avoids any events in the script, and claims that the joy of the audience lies in the effort to understand his difficult-to-understand meditative films.
The most difficult film from “Kinotavr” has already been selected for the Karlovy Vary competition—the directorial star has been born.
The impeccably dressed and groomed programmer Leonid reacts to the world with restrained disgust, hiding away in the den of his neat bachelor lifestyle.
But a cast-iron fist comes crashing down on his head, and the hero is subjected to the unjust actions of the law enforcement authorities, and he begins a senseless flight through Kafkaesque spaces and situations.
“Sometimes it’s useful to work not only with debutants”, the producer Sabina Yeremeyeva triumphantly declared from the stage as she collected the prize.
Critics had a different opinion: in their view, Sabine simply managed to coax a "debutant at heart" out of a veteran of domestic art-house cinema.
And this is symptomatic – these days in our cinema, bison are moving in on the youth market.
Quite the opposite, in fact.
Documentary films that are shot in such a way that they knock your head off more effectively than similar works of fiction.
The author is interested in a screwdriver examining an electric meter, and a piece of unsalted butter drifting on a cast-iron pan—all of this transforms the story of an unemployed miner, his rare-breed lover, and her criminal brother into a realistic oil painting.
The winner of the short film competition, Nikolai Sokolov, applies the black-and-white style of the French New Wave to the world of residential areas.
Even if the Jarovian assembly scenes in the story about two schoolboys, one of whom dreams of making a bomb and the other of playing Bach backwards, seem strange, we should still thank them for this rare attempt at poetizing the reality around us.
"Three times a year - on the eve of Victory Day, Russia Day, and City Day - about ten aircraft of the An-12, Il-18, An-32, and An-24 types, equipped with meteorological equipment and technical means for influencing clouds during the course of the work, are flown into the sky, loaded with special environmentally friendly chemicals - liquid nitrogen, granulated carbon dioxide ('dry ice'), meteorological pyrotechnic charges with iodine silver, and powdered reagents.
The process works as follows: planes fly at a distance of 50-100 kilometres from Moscow (depending on the length and strength of the rain front) and “break up” the clouds heading towards the city with these reagents. The particles of the substances condense around the moisture.
As a result, precipitation occurs earlier than planned, and precisely in the location where the cloud was affected.”
For the past ten years, work has been underway on a remake of a science fiction film in which Michael York played the lead role.
Recently, the director appointed was Carl Rinsch (he already has a remake of “The Creature from the Black Lagoon” on his schedule), who made a name for himself with his advertising spots.
Previously, the project was associated with the names of Bryan Singer (X-Men), James McTeigue (V for Vendetta), and Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy).
The plot revolves around a character who turns thirty and is forced to flee the death penalty, since the society of the future executes all citizens upon reaching that age.
Robert Rodriguez has acquired the rights to a 80s rotoscoped fantasy film and plans to turn it into a full-scale movie.
The original was the result of a joint creative effort by director Ralph Bakshi (the movie adaptation of The Lord of the Rings, 1976) and fantasy artist Frank Frazetta.
The theme of the cartoon was swords, magic, and a large number of drawn cucumbers.
In it, the warrior Larn saves Princess Tiga and the entire nation from the evil ruler of ice, Necron.
Rodriguez promises to pay close attention to the creation of non-humans and barbarians on the pterodactyls.
George A. Romero will send his zombies on vacation for the time being, as he himself is planning to work on a remake of Dario Argento’s classic horror film.
The film will be released to the big screen by none other than Michael Bay, the master of action, explosions, and horror reboots.
The director of the remake will be Damin Chen, who will also adapt the screenplay.
Argenio and Romero had already worked together on “Night of the Living Dead”, and together they filmed “Two Evil Eyes” in 1990.
This time Dario is not directly involved in the project, but his brother Claudio is producing the film and writing the screenplay.
Jennifer Garner and Nick Nolte will join Russell Brand and Helen Mirren in the remake of the comedy film “Arthur”
"I wanted to infuse more strength into the female character in order to reflect the situation in China," says Chen.
— Chinese women these days run major businesses and win Olympic gold.
Gong Li embodies this strength.”
This is the second time in a row that you play an imaginary character.
Is it a coincidence?
A pattern.
I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I am presenting two films here (at the Kinotavr festival and the Sochi film market - Ed.)
And in both of them, I play a woman of dreams.
But... that’s how the director saw me, that’s how he presented me, and many people probably think that’s how I am in real life.
A dream girl.
Your co-star Alexander Yatzenko bears absolutely no resemblance to his character.
How did you find common ground? What is he like on the job?
He is absolutely not the kind of person he seems to be at first glance.
At first I saw him and thought, 'Yeah... that's not going to be easy for me'.
Probably, without human contact, sincere and genuine contact, we wouldn’t have succeeded.
And this contact happened literally a few minutes after we met.
We became great friends, I’m not afraid to use that word.
I told him all about my fears, all my concerns, about how I was afraid it wouldn't work out, and I asked him for some advice and help, and he was happy to give me that advice and help.
We talked a lot...
I tried to do this because I was very afraid of losing this connection, of losing our mutual understanding.
That’s why we held hands during the premiere and watched the entire film together.
How did the filming in Sevastopol go?
Sevastopol is the first city I visited.
I have never performed there, nor have I ever vacationed there, nor did I visit as a child.
This city has a special magic, a unique character and charm.
And this is a city that you want to return to.
He has his own provincial charm.
A place where nobody is in a hurry and there is always time for everything.
It turns out that it was not difficult for you to play the part of someone in love with this city.
In general, you are extremely natural on screen, which, to be honest, many people did not expect.
How do you work with roles?
Are emotional scenes easy for you to perform?
You see, I am an amateur actor.
And I am, by nature, a very trusting person.
If I agreed to work with a director, then I am essentially putting myself in his hands, and I want to be the test case that they use to create something.
I am well aware of this from the outside, and once again, I ask for advice and talk with the director for a very long time, not just me talking to him, but him conducting preliminary conversations with me and explaining exactly what he needs in a very clear and precise manner.
And then, through long, multi-hour rehearsals, we arrive at the organic quality you’re talking about.
And how did you work with the film director Klim Shipenko?
I was thrilled with everyone involved – the cameraman, the director, the producer, Sasha Yatsenko.
Because I love working with crazy people!
I saw the same thing when I was working with Timur Bekmambetov.
He was ready to go without sleep or food – and this was exactly the situation here.
Not sleeping or eating for days on end – and yet, even in the midst of a thunderstorm or a hailstorm, everything remains the same.
And if something didn’t work out, it was a disaster, and you had to take immediate action to make it work.
In this atmosphere of madness, it's very easy to work.
And it seems to me that when people are so far gone in their painful fanaticism for what they are doing, it cannot fail, because so much energy is being expended.
What scenarios are you refusing to consider?
What are the criteria for selecting the material you will be working with?
I don’t want stupidity, stupid dialogue, movies that say nothing and bring nothing.
I don’t want to work just to appear on screen once more.
Do you have any proposals or projects that you plan to work on in the near future?
There are currently no specific proposals or plans.
I am not the kind of person who draws up schedules.
The script arrived, it interested me, and today this premiere happened.

While we are working on the November issue, film festivals are constantly taking place in Moscow: the American film festival “Amfest”, “2togo”; soon the “2-t-1” festival will begin, followed by the British film festival.
And here's what's interesting: half of my acquaintances are constantly discussing who needs to be boycotted and who needs to be supported, for reasons that are, well, very vague.
Moreover, when one of these festivals is solemnly closed with a terrifying Chu4 projector without English subtitles, nobody seems to notice anything.
It’s the last thing you want to do, but if you buy a ticket with your money and then sit in the theater watching giant pixels and horizontal figures of actors, that’s what you’ll get.
Meanwhile, we have no shortage of releases: "Tron: Legacy" (a sequel to the classic film about virtual reality), "Let Me In" (an American remake of a wonderful Swedish film), "Unstoppable" (another take on trains by Tony Scott), and a wildly detailed account of how the films about Conan, the barbarian, destroyer, and governor were created.

the multi-part fairy tale about the likable wizard with glasses is nearing its conclusion.
Even though the fans of the series have long since read the book and know how it will all end, and those who don’t know what “Expelliarmus” means will stay at home, Harry’s title as the main November blockbuster is virtually guaranteed.
The studios, by the way, are also not made up of fools: in order to stretch out the audience’s enjoyment and squeeze the maximum possible profit out of the franchise, they decided to split the seventh film into two parts.
So the sentimental farewell to the magical world of Hogwarts will be stretched out until next summer.
SOCIAL NETWORK
The history of the creation of the Facebook network
The new film by David Fincher is, first and foremost, a story about a paradox.
The film tells the story of the invention of Facebook, one of the pioneering tools in the field of the Internet, which united the entire world, drove five friends apart, and made its creator, 26-year-old former Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, the youngest billionaire of recent decades.
Jesse Eisenberg in the lead role is just as brilliant as our conflicted genius, an emotionally isolated social outcast with an unpredictable set of motivations and attachments.
Zuckerberg launches the site for a variety of reasons: partly out of frustration with the world around him, partly out of a love of sports, and partly simply because IT'S COOL.
The very idea and its implementation may seem spontaneous and impulsive, but the actual course of events suggests a clear calculation and a well-thought-out business plan.
The strengths of The Social Network become apparent from the very first frames, particularly in the scene before the opening credits, where Zuckerberg is talking in a bar with his ex-girlfriend Erica (Mara): the crisp, tense dialogue by screenwriter Aaron Sorkin gains momentum here and doesn't let up until the very end.
The same can be said of Fincher’s direction: it is relatively restrained (with the exception of the Winklevoss twins, who were played by actors who didn’t look alike).
The face of one of them was superimposed onto another using computer graphics.
Natalie Portman studied at Harvard at the same time as Zuckerberg.
Rooney Mara has been cast in the lead role in Fincher's next film, "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo".
Director David Fincher
IN THEIR ROLES: Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Rune Temte, Justin Timberlake, Armie Hammer, Joshua Pence
SYNOPSIS: The gloomy and introverted Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, having hit a dead end in his personal life, takes on the ambitious task of creating a fundamentally new social network.
As Facebook’s popularity grows, relationships with a few close friends begin to sour, eventually leading to lawsuits.
The colour palette plays its part: warm, at times sunny, even in the dark it remains cozy, manoeuvring between two tangled chains of events and two separate legal disputes.
Not much happens outside the constant discussions in the film: there are no deaths or murders, and all of Zuckerberg’s legal troubles are unlikely to fill even an additional paragraph for his meagre Wikipedia page.
So what was it that attracted 49-year-old Sorkin and 48-year-old Fincher to this story, which is not particularly rich in details?
After watching it, you are left with the firm impression that The Social Network is a portrait of our times, and that the omissions in this case are an important artistic device.
Just twenty years ago, Wall Street was doing more or less the same thing, only on a larger scale - with even bigger egos and bigger deals.
Now that daily liquidity has increased even further, policy is no longer implemented during board meetings or in sandboxes.
Zuckerberg wants to be special, he dreams of being the center of attention.
Severin (Garfield) is hurt that his best friend has a new best friend (Timberlake) and now he has no one to play with.
Winklevosses (Hammer and Pens), meanwhile, are kicking up a fuss: who said that rich, beautiful, and athletic people can't also be intelligent?
(This line is particularly amusing to Fincher.)
If desired, a black comedy could easily be made out of The Social Network.
Zuckerberg is obsessed with the idea of popularity and leadership, but what is more prevalent in his actions - the positive or the negative?
And what social consequences will his invention bring about?
Is he a fraudster?
Or a cunning manipulator?
Fincher and Sorkin would never close the book if it contained even the slightest hint of something like that.
But even that won’t be necessary here: in their version of events, it’s not at all important.
“What does it feel like to feel beautiful?” – this is the question posed in the song “Vabu Wotce A Vsp Map” by Tre Veri Nebe, which precedes the credits.
The hero doesn't know.
The film provides the answer.
Zuckerberg is a representative of a lost online generation that has a poor understanding of beauty and an even poorer understanding of feelings.
A tastefully made drama about a high-profile court case in the age of the internet
In the early 17th century, when Ivan Susalin lived, surnames did not yet become common among people of humble origins.
They were referred to as "the son of such and such".
In other words, patronymics (nicknames based on the father's name) were in use.
But sometimes, for example in the case of a father's remarriage, the matronymic — a nickname based on the mother's name — was used instead.
Susanin is just such a case: "Ivan, son of Susanna".
Serfs of small landowners really did manage without surnames for a long time – why bother with them when you have 20 serfs and they are all always in sight.
However, owners of large estates were forced to give their peasants surnames.
For example, the serfs of Prince Andrei Cherkassky all had surnames by the beginning of the 18th century.
In the 19th century, even small landowners did not keep peasants tied to the land, but instead let them work a trade and pay rent to the landowner.
Such a peasant was entitled to a passport, in which his surname had to be entered.
In Central Russia, 55% of serfs were released into servitude after the abolition of serfdom.
This means that they already had surnames.
Criminal investigators from the capital arrived to investigate the explosion in Novosibirsk
Criminal investigators from the central office and staff from the forensic investigation center have arrived in Novosibirsk to assist with the investigation into the gas explosion at house number 39 on Liniyaya Street, reports NGs.
According to investigators, the defendants, Irina Urbach and Evgeny Kavun, posing as employees of the fictitious organization "Mezhregiongaz", inspected and repaired gas equipment.
They used low-quality spare parts, worked carelessly, but on the other hand, overcharged for their services, reports the agency with reference to an informed source.
The day before the tragedy at Lineynaya Street, a man and a woman visited three apartments in house number 39, where they were changing the hoses of the heating systems.
For example, in one of the apartments they installed a hose for water instead of a gas line.
Kavun, however, denies this.
According to him, this is impossible, everything has been certified.
As a result of their actions, there was a leak and explosion of a gas-air mixture in one of the apartments.
Two stairwells collapsed - one completely, the other partially.
This led to a significant collapse of the building, which resulted in the deaths of 13 people.
Earlier, suspects in the case of the explosion of a house in Novosibirsk were arrested.
The fraudsters themselves came from Omsk.
Petersburg managed to avoid a tidal surge flood
Arguments of the Week.
Saint Petersburg → Society

Experts were able to prevent the flooding by closing the dam a day earlier.
On Friday, the threat of flooding in Saint Petersburg increased dramatically due to bad weather in the city.
The coastal flooding was prevented thanks to the timely closure of the dam.
The potential flood could have been the 32nd of its kind, reports the St. Petersburg publication Nevatudey.
The water level reached 184 centimeters, but thanks to the closure of floodgates in the Gulf of Finland, the water level remained at 168 centimeters, which is only seven centimeters above the lower threshold for a dangerous flood (161 to 210 centimeters).
Weather conditions were complicated by strong gusts of wind, the speed of which at times reached 20-25 metres per second.
Now the dam has been reopened, the water level has dropped, and ships can once again navigate the Gulf of Finland.
It should be noted that ten meteorological stations are monitoring the water level situation on the eastern side of the Gulf of Finland.
This allows flooding to be prevented, which may follow an increase in wind speed.
In Turkey, 8 people have been arrested in connection with construction defects in collapsed buildings
Eight people have been arrested in the Turkish province of Şanlıurfa in connection with construction defects found in buildings that collapsed during an earthquake.
As reported by Armenpress, Habertürk is reporting on this as well.
As a result of the earthquake that occurred in Turkey on February 6, more than 20 thousand people lost their lives.
The number of wounded exceeds 80 thousand.
It is noted that this earthquake is the strongest one since 1939.
The earthquake with a magnitude of 7.7 was followed by hundreds of aftershocks that were felt not only in 10 provinces of Turkey, but also in neighboring Syria.
Pashinyan sent congratulatory messages to the supreme leader of Iran and the country’s president
Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan sent congratulatory messages to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Seyed Ali Khamenei, and to the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ebrahim Raisi, on the occasion of the 44th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.
Armenpress reported this information, citing the Department of Information and Public Relations of the Office of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia.
The message to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution of Iran, Seyed Ali Khamenei, states:
"Your Eminence,
I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you on the 44th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution.
The warm and friendly Armenian-Iranian relations, with centuries-old roots, a rich history, and traditions, are of particular importance for our two countries.
More than three decades have passed since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Republic of Armenia and the Islamic Republic of Iran, and we are witnessing steady and stable bilateral cooperation.
I am confident that the Armenian-Iranian friendship, forged in an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust, will achieve even greater successes for the benefit of the peoples of Armenia and Iran in the future.
I take this opportunity to wish you good health and many years of life”.
The congratulatory message sent to Ebrahim Raisi, in particular, states: “Your Excellency, please accept our heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to you and the friendly people of Iran on the occasion of the 44th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution.
Based on centuries of history and mutual respect, the unbreakable Armenian-Iranian relationship is of particular importance to the Republic of Armenia.
I am confident that as a result of our joint efforts we will be able to take interstate cooperation to a new level, the multisectoral agenda of which will be expanded even further for the benefit of the well-being of our two friendly nations and the security of our countries.
Emphasizing the importance of our views on establishing and strengthening regional peace and stability, I reiterate the official invitation extended to you during my visit to Tehran last year to visit Armenia.
I take this opportunity to wish you further success, and the friendly people of Iran a stable peace.”

Caption for the video: A WW2 bomb explosion in Great Yarmouth is caught on camera
In England, in the port city of Great Yarmouth, an aerial bomb from World War II exploded on Friday, which sappers were attempting to defuse.
A powerful explosion was heard over dozens of kilometers, but there were no casualties.
The Norfolk County Police have announced that, although the explosion was unplanned, none of the military personnel involved in defusing the bomb were injured.
“The device detonated shortly after work began on neutralizing it.
Fortunately, all crew members are safe.
The agencies have begun assessing the damage," Norfolk police assistant chief Nick Davison told reporters.
Locals write on social media that the explosion shook houses located 24 km away.
Photographer: Sky Revolutions
Caption to the photo: The explosion occurred despite the plans of the sappers, but there were no fatalities or injuries.
A 250-kilogram bomb was found during construction work on the bank of the River Yar, at the mouth of which, on the North Sea coast, Great Yarmouth is located.
Before attempting to defuse the bomb, the sappers built a protective sand wall around it, and a cordon, which kept outsiders at a distance of 200 metres, was set up.
The explosive experts initially attempted to remove the detonator from the bomb on Thursday with the help of a robot, but the attempt failed, and so they decided, as local press reports it, to use the "slow burning" technique to detonate the explosives.
This burning process also caused an explosion.
During World War II, the Nazis dropped hundreds of thousands of bombs on Britain.
During the eight-month intensive bombing campaign, known as "The Blitz", that took place from autumn 1940 to spring 1941, 450,000 bombs were dropped on Britain.
Among Belarusian researchers, women make up almost 40%
In Belarus, women make up 38.9% of researchers, reported Alesya Solovey, a research associate at the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences, to BELTA.
The proportion of women among candidates of science and doctors of science is also growing: among candidates of science, women make up 41.1%, among doctors of science – 21%.
In all fields of study, except for technical ones, the percentage of women exceeds 50%.
The most feminized area of scientific knowledge is medical science, where women make up 64.4% of the workforce.
Only in technical sciences are men in the majority, accounting for 26.7%.
In the National Academy of Sciences, the percentage of women researchers is 49.1% – this is higher than the national average by 10.2%.
Among candidates of science, women account for 46%, while among doctors of science the figure is 20%.
Among the faculty at institutions of higher education, more than half are women (57%).
Among the pro-rectors for research, teaching, and educational work, every third is a woman (31.8%), among deans – 38.7%, assistant deans – 44.6%, heads of departments – 42.5%.
The majority of senior lecturers and lecturers are women, accounting for over 60%.
There is a high percentage of women among associate professors on the faculty (55.2%).
According to a Republican public opinion survey conducted by the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences last year, the majority of Belarusians do not support gender stereotypes regarding women's opportunities in science.
63.5% (56.5% of men and 69% of women) disagree to some extent with the gender stereotype that science is a male domain.
More than half of the country's residents do not hold the opinion that women are less competent as scientists – 66.1% (59% men and 71.6% women).
“The transformation of gender-based ideas about women’s research competence in the general consciousness contributes to attracting young women to science, developing their creative potential, and forming a successful role model for a female scientist, including through the transfer of experience and the mentorship system”, noted Alesya Solovey.
February 11 is annually celebrated as the International Day of Women and Girls in Science.
The holiday was established to introduce women and girls to the field of science, to encourage women to pursue scientific careers, and to recognize the achievements of women in science.
According to UNESCO data, women make up 30% of the total number of researchers in the world.
The likelihood of a further increase in the key rate is higher than that of a decrease in the future
The Chairperson of the Bank of Russia, Elvira Nabiullina, made this statement following the meeting of the Board of Directors on February 10, which decided to keep the rate at 7.50%.
The head of the regulator, in particular, noted that important changes have occurred recently.
On the one hand, the conditions of foreign trade have significantly worsened – the price of Russian oil has decreased.
On the other hand, the economic situation is developing better than predicted in October.
The shift in the structure of demand is continuing: consumption remains restrained, private investment is slowing down, but government spending is increasing.
At the same time, overall inflation risks have increased.
“Therefore, this year the likelihood of a rate hike exceeds the likelihood of a rate cut.
The appropriateness of changing the rate will be determined by developments in the situation”, said E. Nazarov.
In addition to the more pronounced impact of fiscal policy, she identified three risks.
Firstly, rapid growth in consumption in the context of heightened inflationary expectations, in the event that the factors that are currently holding back consumer activity weaken.
Secondly, there is a growing shortage of workers and a lag in growth in labor productivity compared to growth in wages.
And there are still risks of additional tightening of sanctions restrictions.
When discussing future decisions by the regulator, the Chairperson of the Bank of Russia noted that, despite the previously noted increase in pro-inflationary factors, the inflation forecast for the current year remains at 5–7%.
According to her, this may require a higher trajectory for the key interest rate than was assumed in October.
In the updated forecast of the Central Bank for this and the next year, the ranges for the average key rate have been raised by half a percentage point, to 7.0-9.0% per annum in 2023 and 6.5-7.5% per annum in 2024.
“This does not rule out the possibility of a rate cut this year, but its likelihood and scale have decreased.
On the other hand, the likelihood has increased that some increase in the rate may be necessary in order to achieve an inflation rate of around 4% in 2024", concluded the head of the Bank of Russia.
The Bank of Russia has approved requirements for the procedure for creating special closed-end mutual investment funds (MIFs) consisting of blocked foreign securities.
The regulator informs that such securities will be removed from the composition of existing retail mutual funds.
This will make it possible to start managing the remaining liquid assets and to resume operations with investment shares.
If more than 10% of the retail mutual fund consists of blocked securities, the management company must allocate them to a separate closed mutual fund by September 1, 2023.
Each shareholder will be issued shares in the new fund in a quantity equal to the shares in the main fund.
Another option is to change the status of the retail fund to closed.
For funds with less than 10% of blocked securities, the new requirements are not mandatory.
However, the management company has the right to allocate the frozen assets into a separate closed mutual fund.
In addition, there is a requirement to inform shareholders about the consequences of withdrawing blocked securities from a special mutual fund.
In the future, in the event that such securities are issued, management companies will be required to pay investment fund unit holders at least 90% of the proceeds on a quarterly basis, according to a statement from the Bank of Russia.
In addition to summarizing the results of the industry, the experts also provided a forecast for the current year.
According to data from the Analytics and Expertise Center of Promsvyazbank, in 2022, passenger traffic on Russia’s air transport system decreased by 6.3%, while passenger transportation decreased by 14.2%.
The volume of passenger traffic amounted to 95.2 million people, while passenger turnover was 228.0 billion passenger-kilometers.
International passenger traffic amounted to 17.2 million people, which is 26.7% lower than the previous year, while domestic traffic amounted to 78.0 million people (-10.9%).
PSB analysts note that the industry's relative stability was influenced by government support programs.
In 2022, a program to stimulate domestic tourism was in effect, with 38.8 billion rubles allocated for it.
Tourists were able to receive a partial refund for tours with flights arranged by Rosturizm.
Several state support programs were also implemented to ensure the accessibility of air travel, including subsidies for passenger transportation and the development of regional transportation, etc., with a total budget of more than 27.5 billion rubles.
In the second quarter of 2022, the government decided to allocate an additional 100 billion rubles to airlines and to recapitalize Aeroflot by 52.5 billion rubles.
“Despite the sanctions pressure on the Russian aviation industry, as a result of the development of domestic tourism and the opening of new international routes, as well as the continuation of state subsidies to the industry (so far 25.3 billion rubles have been allocated) in 2023, passenger traffic is expected to increase by 6.4%, to 101.2 million people (domestic passenger traffic will amount to 91.1 million people), according to the forecast of Rosaviation, or up to 103.0 million people”, predict the analysts at PSB.
A terrorist attack in Jerusalem, a 6-year-old child killed
Two people, including a 6-year-old child, were victims of a terrorist attack in Jerusalem: a car drove at high speed into a bus stop.
Another six people were injured.
The driver of the car was shot dead on the spot.
It was later discovered that the perpetrator was a 31-year-old Palestinian from East Jerusalem.
Law enforcement agencies classified his actions as a terrorist attack, the terrorist’s relatives have been detained, and his house has been sealed off.
At the same time, according to reports in Israeli media, the attacker had mental health issues and was only released from the hospital this week.
Austria is once again tightening control at its border with Hungary following another influx of migrants in recent months.
Officials say that many people are staying at the border in their cars, waiting to cross over into Austria.
In this way, it serves as a signal to the Austrian authorities that they have already completed the asylum procedure in Hungary.
Based on existing agreements, Austria believes that migrants are obliged to remain in the country where the request was filed.
At the same time, the Austrian authorities consider it wrong to automatically send those wishing to cross the border back to Hungary: many migrants fall victim to smugglers and find themselves between two border posts with no right to return to Hungary.
This is why, according to the police, stricter control is necessary.
The decision to step up inspections by Vienna followed a promise by leaders of the European Union to allocate more funds for cameras, drones, and watchtowers for the protection of the community's borders.
According to data from the Frontex agency, last year the number of illegal migrants who arrived in the EU and applied for refugee status exceeded the figures for 2016 for the first time, reaching more than 330 thousand.
The cargo ship "Progress 83" successfully docked with the ISS
The automatic supply ship Progress 83 successfully docked with the International Space Station on Saturday at 3:45 AM GMT, completing a two-day orbital flight.
The docking occurred at an altitude of 269 statute miles above the southern Pacific Ocean.
The live broadcast of the docking was managed by the NASA control center in Houston, Texas.
In Russia, the docking was monitored by specialists from the Mission Control Center.
From the ISS, the cargo ship was greeted by the cosmonauts Sergei Prokopyev, Dmitry Petelin, and Anna Kikina.
The Progress MS-22 spacecraft delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS, including 720 kg of refuelling fuel, 420 kg of water, and approximately 1,354 kg of dry cargo.
In addition, the ship delivered food for the Russian cosmonauts.
The Progress 83 successfully launched from the Russian cosmodrome of Baikonur on Thursday.
At the same time, Roscosmos reported a loss of pressure in the Progress MSC-21 spacecraft, which was prepared for separation from the ISS and subsequent ditching on February 18.
As specified by the company’s press service, the ship’s hatch was immediately sealed: the Progress MS-21 is isolated from the overall volume of the ISS.
The reasons for its depressurization are being investigated."
TsUP also reported that nothing threatens the ISS crew: "The temperature and pressure on board the station are within normal limits.
There is no threat to the lives or health of the crew, their condition is good”.
“There has been an increase in cases of birth tourism.”
How pregnant Russian women got stranded in Argentina
The migration service of Argentina has begun suspending and revoking residence permits for Russians who obtained them through the birth of a child but did not remain living in the country.
Earlier, the authorities of the republic denied entry to the country to several pregnant Russian women who were suspected of having come for the purposes of "maternity tourism".
On February 11, they were still allowed to enter Argentina following a court decision.
More information can be found in the article on Gazeta.Ru.
The migration service of Argentina has begun suspending and revoking residence permits (RVPs) of Russians who obtained them through the birth of a child, but did not remain living in the country.
The director of the service, Florencia Carignano, spoke about this on the C5N television channel.
“What we are doing is suspending the residence permits of those Russians who came to obtain a residence permit because their child is an Argentinian citizen, but who have spent more time outside (Argentina) than inside (the country)”, she explained.
According to her, when the court considers the issue of Argentine citizenship for the Russian national, the migration service will submit data indicating that the residence permit was suspended because this person “spent a month in Argentina and never returned”.
Carignano warned that Russians who received a residence permit after the birth of a child and then left the country may have their permit revoked.
Against this backdrop, on February 9 it was reported that three pregnant Russian women were "stuck" at the airport in Argentina due to being denied entry into the country.
According to Georgy Polin, head of the consular department at the Russian embassy in Argentina, the diplomatic mission believes that the incident was caused by the fact that the authorities of the republic may have considered the information provided by the girls upon entry to be incomplete or false.
One of them arrived on February 7, and the other two arrived in the evening of February 8, RIA Novosti reports.
The diplomat emphasized that more pregnant women arrived in Argentina, but these three in particular were issued a decree prohibiting them from entering the country.
“They were not allowed to enter the country in accordance with the migration law, where one of the reasons for not allowing entry is the provision of incomplete, false, or misleading information”, Polin said.
On Saturday, February 11th, the immigration service of Argentina, by decision of the court, allowed pregnant Russian citizens into the country, reported lawyer Christian Rubilar.
"An hour ago, they were all allowed to enter Argentina", TASS reports him as saying.
Rubilar noted that the migration service changed its decision following a court ruling.
It is easier for a child’s foreign parents, born in Argentina, to obtain a passport for the republic.
It allows for short-term travel to 171 countries without a visa, including EU states, Great Britain, and Japan, notes RBK.
In early January 2023, the newspaper The Guardian wrote about a “boom in maternity tourism” to Argentina among Russians.
According to Polina, between 2,000 and 2,500 Russian citizens moved to the republic in 2022.
Many of them, the diplomat noted, are Russian women who are going there to give birth.
“In 2023, this number could grow to 10 thousand”, he said.
In turn, Carignano previously stated that in 2022, around 10,500 Russian citizens arrived in Argentina, and over the past few months, more than 5,800 pregnant women.
On February 9th, it was announced how prices for rental housing in Saint Petersburg had changed.
It has become 10% cheaper.
At the same time, it is known that rental prices have increased by 25% across the country, reports Patrol of Petersburg with reference to RBK.
The average monthly rent for an apartment in St. Petersburg at the beginning of 2023 was 27,000 rubles.
A one-bedroom apartment cost 25,000 rubles per month, a studio apartment cost 22,000 rubles per month, and a two-bedroom apartment cost 36,000 rubles per month.
Experts believe that this trend may change as early as spring, when many citizens who have been abroad return home.
The reasons for questioning the women in a foreign country have become known.
The migration service of Argentina did not allow six pregnant Russian women into the country, since the purpose of their visit, as stated by them, was found to be false.
This was reported by TASS with reference to the television channel Todo Noticias.
For five hours, pregnant women were asked questions about the purpose of their visit.
Most of them admitted that they had come to a foreign country to give birth.
In this regard, representatives of the country did not allow Russian women to enter Argentina.
As specified in the publication, the migration service has a procedure to follow in cases where there are suspicions of "fraudulent" travelers.
For example, if it is obvious that a woman is 33 weeks pregnant, she doesn’t have a return ticket to Russia, and she can’t provide a clear explanation of where she is going to go on holiday, then the immigration authorities immediately start to suspect her.
Moreover, the experts specify that it is difficult to be a traveler "in such conditions".
The artist’s decision to leave the theatre was planned.
State Prize of the Russian Federation laureate Alexander Filipppenko stated that the decision of the Moscow Sovet Theatre not to renew his contract was planned, and that everything was agreed upon in advance with management.
He spoke about this in an interview with Interfax news agency.
In the productions in which he took part, the artists from the second cast were invited.
The People’s Artist of the Russian Federation specified that his contract had expired as far back as 2022.
All the details had long been agreed upon with representatives of the theatre.
What’s more, everyone knew that the star had no intention of renewing her contract.
Filipppenko noted that the authorities agreed to this and prepared all the necessary documents.
He assures us that he “did not let anyone down”.
In addition to this, it has been reported that the artist has emigrated from Russia.
He flew to his heir in Latvia.
Filippenkko plans to undergo “long-term treatment” in a foreign country.
As stated in the publication, at the moment the film actor works at a Moscow theatre as a guest actor.
According to the publication, the actor performed at the Moscow City Council in such productions as “Shakespeare’s Hamlet” and “The Taming of the Shrew”, “Uncle Vanya”, as well as “Three Sisters”.
On Friday, February 10th, 340 thousand cubic metres of snow were removed from private sector areas in Kalininsky AO.
This information was shared by the city's mayor's office.
At the moment, there are more than four hundred streets in the Kalininsky district that fall under the private sector and from which snow must be cleared by spring.
The roads will be cleaned in two stages.
The first will conclude on 15 February, while the second will run from 1 March to 15 April.
114 units of specialized equipment and 123 workers will take part in the cleanup efforts.
Authorities reported that contractors are facing the problem of residents from nearby houses shoveling snow onto the roadway.
Kirkorov won the lawsuit against the fisherman.
In the lawsuit, the man claimed that the construction of the artist’s home was illegal, but he did not appear at the hearing.
The fisherman sued the musician Philip Kirkorov over an allegedly illegally installed pier on his dacha outside Moscow.
This is reported by "Pятница" (Friday) channel.
However, the Saratov fisherman was unable to win the case.
The complaint against the singer was reviewed by the Onezhtovsky City Court. According to the lawyer, documents and design projects were presented in court that confirmed the legality of all the structures installed on the property of the celebrity.
As the head of the law firm, Alexander Dobrovinsky, specifies, the construction of the pier left the plaintiff with no chance of going fishing.
The application for the contractor was submitted on January 11.
The celebrity lawyer joked that, most likely, the man had planned to fish exclusively from the artist's home.
Ironically, Dobrovinsky specified that he would ask Kirkorov to provide the plaintiff with access to his own balcony for fishing.
He emphasized that from that location it is possible to keep casting with a spinning rod.
A sleep specialist has named the causes of sleep problems
Sleep specialist doctor Sophia Cherkasova spoke about foods and habits that hinder healthy sleep.
As the specialist noted, sleep problems often arise due to products containing caffeine.
This primarily concerns tea, coffee, chocolate, and any desserts containing cocoa.
Their use before bed should be limited, since they not only interfere with falling asleep, but also make sleep “jumpy”, meaning it doesn’t allow the body to fully recover.
According to the doctor, it is best to stop consuming caffeine-containing products 6-8 hours before bedtime.
Otherwise, they contribute to a decrease in the threshold of excitability of the nervous system, and as a result, difficulties with falling asleep arise.
Alcohol also negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
The doctor clarifies that small doses of alcoholic beverages help to relax and do not affect sleep.
However, quantities exceeding 36 grams, when converted into pure alcohol, lead to various sleep disorders, such as superficial sleep and frequent nighttime awakenings.
In addition, in order to prevent sleep problems, the sleep specialist recommends giving up spicy food and large portions.
Large meals and spicy food contribute to an increase in internal body temperature, which negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
It’s not only important to maintain an external temperature regime for healthy sleep: an optimal temperature for the air is 18-20 degrees – but it’s also important to avoid elevated body temperature.
According to Cherkasova, it’s not a good idea to overindulge in heavy foods before bed, as it won’t allow the body to fully recover and rest: it will be forced to expend energy on digestion.
The doctor also reminded that a lack of healthy sleep and accumulated sleep deprivation affect the quality of life and daily activities, which is why it is crucial to stick to a sleep and rest schedule and allow the body to recover.
Bloomberg has named the competitor of Trump in the upcoming presidential election: World: Politics: INFOX.ru
According to the agency, the governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, will be the main competitor of the former president in the upcoming elections.
The Republican Desantis has not yet officially announced his intention to run for the presidency, but sources from Bloomberg report that he is already preparing for the primaries.
According to the agency, Desantis’ team is already selecting consultants to participate in the presidential election and conducting preliminary polls.
As confirmation of this, Bloomberg reports on a planned off-site meeting for Republican Party leaders and government officials scheduled for the end of February.
The agency reports that the team of the governor of Florida is seeking support among their Republican colleagues from Iowa, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and other states. Experts at Bloomberg have named Desantis as the main potential rival to Donald Trump.
Experts consider the current governor of Florida to be well-known enough that he doesn't need to start a campaign right now, and also note his ability to raise money.
Ron DeSantis supported Donald Trump’s nomination for president in 2017, and may run against him in the upcoming presidential election in November 2024.
Donald Trump officially announced his intention to run for president "to make America great again" during a speech to his supporters in Florida.
The current president, Joe Biden, despite assurances from his team that he intends to participate in the 60th presidential election, has stated that he has not made a firm decision on this matter.
In France, hundreds of protests against the pension reform will take place on Saturday.
The fourth day of mass protests against the pension reform is being held by trade unions in France on Saturday.
French media report that hundreds of demonstrations will take place across the country.
After a slight decrease in the number of participants in protests on Tuesday compared to the first two “days of mobilisation”, the trade unions are hoping to bring more people onto the streets this time, taking into account citizens who were unable to participate in the protests on a weekday.
Law enforcement agencies expect between 600 thousand and 800 thousand protesters to arrive from across the country, including between 90 thousand and 120 thousand in Paris, according to media reports.
According to the French Ministry of the Interior, 757 thousand people took part in protests against the pension reform on February 7.
The largest trade union association, the General Confederation of Labour (VKT), claimed that there were 2 million protesters.
According to VKT, 400 thousand demonstrators also took to the streets of Paris on Tuesday.
The police claim that there were 57 thousand of them.
The day before the protests (January 31st), the number of demonstrators was estimated by the police at 1.27 million and by the trade unions at 2.8 million.
The next mass protests are planned for February 16.
As reported, on January 10, the Prime Minister of France, Elizabeth Borne, presented the government's draft pension reform project, which provides for an increase in the retirement age from 62 to 64 years.
It is expected that the established retirement age threshold will gradually be raised from 62 to 64 over a period of three months per year, and this process will continue until 2030.
The new regime will be applied to generations of French citizens born in September 1961 or later.
During the 2022 election campaign, the President of France Emmanuel Macron declared his determination to carry out pension reform before the end of his second presidential term.
On February 6, consideration of the government's draft pension reform began in the National Assembly of France.

More than 180 traffic accidents occurred in Astana in a single day: February 11, 2023, 14:10.
ASTANA.KAZINFORM - The police department of the capital is urging drivers to be extremely cautious on the roads, taking into account the impact of weather conditions, reduced visibility during precipitation, and changes in the traction properties of the road surface due to ice.
Over the past 24 hours, 181 accidents were recorded.
This was reported by MIA Kazinform with reference to the press service of the police department of the city of Astana.
Pedestrians should also be attentive on the road, since violations by them of the rules for crossing the roadway also often lead to serious consequences.
This year there have been 11 incidents of vehicles striking pedestrians who crossed the road in violation of established rules; all 11 pedestrians sustained injuries.
In total, 35 accidents have been recorded since the beginning of the year, in which 3 people were killed and 39 people were injured with various degrees of severity.
In order to prevent traffic accidents, more than 16,000 traffic violations have been stopped by police in the capital since the beginning of the year, 213 drunk drivers have been apprehended, and more than 1,600 pedestrian violators have been fined.
13 drivers with fake license plates were detained, as well as 86 drivers for operating vehicles without license plates.
The loss of pressure in the Progress MS-21 occurred at the ISS: February 12, 2023, 00:12.
TASS – KAZINFORM – Roscosmos reported a loss of pressure in the Progress MS-21, which was prepared for separation from the ISS, TASS reports, citing MIA Kazinform.
"The contours of the Progress MS-21 transport cargo ship, whose flooding is scheduled for February 18, have been depressurized, as confirmed by telemetry data received at the Mission Control Center", reported the Roscosmos press service.
As noted, at the moment it is isolated from the rest of the station.
The causes of the incident are being investigated, and it did not affect the docking of the Progress MS-22 cargo ship or the rest of the ISS flight program.
The situation was commented on by Sergei Krikalev, Roscosmos executive director for manned space programs.
“A cargo ship that has been docked at the station for several months experienced a leak of heat transfer fluid from the thermoregulation system.
The situation is somewhat similar to what happened to our ship ("Soyuz MS-22" - ed. TASS) in mid-December", he said, noting that the commission that analyzed the incident with the "Soyuz" concluded that the leak was caused by a micrometeoroid.
Roscosmos will conduct an analysis to ensure that there are no problems with future launches.
“We need to conduct a thorough analysis to make sure that this cause does not apply to similar designs in future launches.
This is the most important task that now lies ahead of us”, he said.
According to the CEO, an analysis will need to be conducted in terms of the ship's preparation for launch, the materials used, and the technologies used in the assembly of the radiator.
The same analysis was conducted in the case of the damaged radiator on the Soyuz MS-22 spacecraft.
“The most important thing is to make sure that this is not some kind of systematic error”, added Krikalev.
The CEO specified that a commission began work on Saturday to analyze all possible causes.
“The ship was scheduled to be undocked and deorbited two days before the launch of the Soyuz spacecraft (Soyuz MS-23 – ed. TASS), so the actions of the crew, the work of the crew… This will not affect the programme from this point of view”, noted Krikalev.
The Progress MS-21 cargo vehicle was launched from Baikonur using a Soyuz-2.1a carrier rocket on October 26.
Two days later, it docked with the small research module "Search" from the Russian segment of the ISS.
The spacecraft delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS.
NASA has named the location of the “Progress” spacecraft’s loss of pressure event.
The loss of pressure in the cargo ship Progress MS-21 at the International Space Station (ISS) occurred in the temperature control system.
This was announced by a representative of the American Mission Control Center (MCC) during negotiations with the ISS crew, which were broadcast by NASA.
According to NASA, the coolant leak from Progress has now stopped.
At NASA, they believe that all the refrigerant has completely leaked out.
“This morning we had a leak of refrigerant from the thermoregulation system into space, but the leak has been stopped”, the representative of the American TLP (quoted by Interfax) stated.
Earlier, the "Progress" module was isolated due to a loss of pressure.
Roscosmos reported that the cosmonauts are not in any danger.
The Progress MS-22 docked with the ISS today, February 11, and it will be deorbited on February 18, according to plan.
John Kirby, coordinator of strategic communications for the US National Security Council, declined to announce a possible trip by US President Joe Biden to Ukraine.
He announced this to journalists during a briefing that was broadcast on the White House YouTube channel.

The day before, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre announced Biden's visit to Poland from February 20 to 22.
As stated by a representative of the administration, during the trip, the President of the United States will discuss bilateral cooperation with the Polish leadership, as well as joint efforts to support Ukraine and strengthen NATO's deterrence capabilities.
Prior to this, Kirby stated that Biden would visit Ukraine when the time was right, but that now is not the time for official visits.
A fitness expert talks about exercising outside in the winter to lose weight
A fitness expert has called walking in winter an excellent way to lose weight without intense exercise.
Fitness expert Anthony Yeung spoke about effective interval training outside to help lose weight.
His words were reported by the website Eat This, Not That.
The specialist called taking brisk walks in the winter an excellent way to lose weight without engaging in intense exercise, as well as to improve the condition of the cardiovascular system and psychological wellbeing.
“The first five to ten minutes should be at a normal pace, to warm up your body and joints.
Then, for one minute, walk as fast as you can, without transitioning into a run.
One minute at a normal pace," explains Eng.
It is necessary to make three approaches.
Next, the specialist advises doing lunges or squats with weights for 15 seconds, followed by walking at a comfortable pace for another 45 seconds.
This sequence needs to be repeated five times. Then, Yeng suggests alternating between an active step (two minutes) and a resting step (one minute) three more times.
The walk should be concluded with a five-minute stroll at a leisurely pace and a few stretching exercises.
In total, this workout will take 35 minutes in the fresh air.
Earlier, the master of sports in track and field, Maksim Babenkov-Kudryavtsev, in a commentary for Lenta.ru, offered advice on choosing clothing for winter runs.
“You will need thermal underwear, moisture-wicking clothing, special lightweight but warm headgear.
Running shoes for winter are made of denser materials, have a higher platform, and have a protective sole," the athlete said.
On February 17th, a creative evening will be held at the TsDL featuring an Orthodox writer, historian, screenwriter, and member of the Russian Writers’ Union.
Writers, screenwriters, and scholars will participate in the event.
The programme also includes Zlatan Aleksandr (piano), a laureate of all-Russian and international competitions; Akinfin Dmitry (violin), a laureate of international competitions and member of the orchestra of Vladimir Spivakov; the choir group from the Holy Trinity Sergius Lavra and the Moscow Theological Academy (MTA), conducted by Hieromonk Nestor.
The event will begin at 18:30.
The head of Serpukhov inspected the living conditions in apartment buildings.
The head of Serpuhov municipality, Sergei Nikitenko, conducted a working inspection of the area.
Together with representatives of management organizations, he inspected the condition of apartment buildings and residential homes.
The addresses from which the most appeals were received from residents were found to be under the strictest control.
- Many of the complaints are well-founded and primarily concern the cleaning of stairwells and the maintenance of common areas.
Serpukhov residents themselves are not standing by idly and are actively fighting the problem of vandalism, particularly as it relates to graffiti.
We will work on this issue taking into account the "Safe Region" cameras, said the head of the municipality, Sergei Nikitenko.
Attention was also drawn to the replacement of mailboxes, light bulbs, the installation of wiring in the boxes, and the late removal of garbage from container areas.
Management companies must solve all the tasks set before them as quickly as possible.
The Deputy CEO of RZD proposed that the Governor of the Irkutsk region explore new sales markets
The Irkutsk region needs to continue exploring alternative sales markets besides the Far East.
This includes both the domestic market and the ports of the Western region, including the Azov-Black Sea basin.
This proposal was made by Alexei Shilo, deputy CEO of RZD, during a meeting with Governor Igor Kobzev, reports the regional government on February 10, 2023.
As demonstrated by last year’s experience, even despite the geographical location of the Irkutsk region, this solution can be extremely effective.
It is important that the logistics services of companies constantly interact with our ‘counterparts’ (ports, operators, maritime transport companies) and find optimal pricing conditions for transporting their products according to new schemes, emphasised Aleksei Shilo.
The governor noted the importance of stable product shipments. The Irkutsk region is one of the richest in mineral resources in the Russian Federation and has significant reserves of coal and brown coal.
About 25 enterprises are engaged in coal mining in the region.
The instability of exports has a negative impact on the financial and economic activities of coal mining companies.
Igor Kobzov also emphasized that the Irkutsk region is export-oriented, which is why it is necessary to increase the monthly quota for the transportation of timber and metal products manufactured in the region to a level that ensures the stable operation of such enterprises.
Realizing the importance of the Irkutsk region as an industrial center, we, for our part, will do everything we can to provide support in terms of transportation volumes.
If additional volumes for domestic shipments appear, we are also ready to provide assistance in this regard, said Aleksey Shilo.
Konstantin Zaitsev held a meeting with the citizens of the villages of Granovschina and Homutovo
At the order of the head of the region, Igor Kobzev, the Chairman of the Government of Priangarye, Konstantin Zaicev, worked today in the villages of Granovshchina and Khomutovo in the Irkutsk region.
In the village of Granovschina, the Chairman of the Government familiarized himself with the work of a new educational institution, the Granovscha school, which opened in September 2022.
The facility was built as part of the federal project "Modern School" within the national project "Education".
The following facilities are located in eight school blocks: classrooms, a dining hall, a kitchen, an auditorium, two gymnasiums, club rooms, a library, administrative offices, restrooms, common recreational areas, and a medical facility.
240.8 million rubles were allocated from the federal budget for the construction, more than 512 million rubles from regional funds, and more than 72 million rubles from the municipal entity.
In addition, a regional subsidy was allocated for the purchase of equipment in the amount of 64.2 million rubles.
After the opening of the school, children from the village of Granovschina were joined by students from the Urikovskaya school, which was undergoing renovation.
More than 100 educators work there, of which almost 90 are subject teachers.
In 2022, a bus was allocated to the school, purchased by the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation as part of a federal program.
Capital repairs on Homutovskaya Secondary School No. 2 began in 2022.
Students in the lower grades have been assigned to Homutovskaya School No. 1, while the older students attend classes in the second building of School No. 2.
According to the renovation plan, the roof, engineering infrastructure, windows, and related elements will be replaced, the facade will be renovated, and the interior of the premises will be refurbished.
An important component of the renovation is the re-creation of a heating plant with water heating, which was replaced with dry heat.
The total cost of all the work is more than 80 million roubles.
Repairs are nearing completion, there are problems with connecting to the power grid – we need an increase in power, we are working with the power supply organization.
Furthermore, in Granovschina and Khomutovo, Konstantin Zaitsev held a meeting with citizens, some of whom had their homes illegally connected to the electrical grid by developers.
It was decided that the network company would organise a personal meeting to resolve these issues next week.
Very often, a stable power supply is the main condition when buying a house, because people are increasingly using electricity for heating.
That is why sellers often illegally connect homes to nearby networks, and this is already grounds for disconnection of electricity supply.
This is why network companies in areas where active construction is underway should pay special attention to this issue, emphasized Konstantin Zaitsev.
Anatoly Prokopyev assessed the effectiveness of state support measures for smallholder farms in the UOBO region
The head of the UOBO, Anatoly Prokopyev, visited three individual farms today in the Ekhirit-Bugulak district.
The head of a family farm in the village of Kapsal, Yulia Madayeva, received a grant for the development of her farm as a beginning farmer in 2014.
One of the main areas of activity of the farm is the production of livestock products.
Every year the livestock population is increasing and gross production of meat and milk is growing.
Later, thanks to state support, it became possible in 2019 to participate and win a grant in the form of subsidies for the development of a family-run dairy farm.
Today, the cattle population of the farm is around 150 head, 60 of which are cows.
In addition, they grow cereal crops and plant annual fodder crops.
Thanks to the activities of KFH headed by Viktor Katanayev, the locality of Kharyashino in the village of Kulunkun has been reclassified as a settlement.
The farm is engaged in breeding and fattening dairy cattle.
In 2014, they received a grant to develop a family-run dairy farm with 60 head of cattle.
Today, the farm has a cattle population of 150 head.
They have also been growing potatoes here for many years.
The head of the family farm strives to create all the necessary conditions for the team to work and live.
Now there is an entire village on the estate.
Anatoly Prokopyev has taken personal control of the issue of constructing two km of road from the area of Kharyashino to Ust-Orda.
The main activities of the KFH of Stalina Mogzoeva in the village of Otonkhoi are cattle breeding and the raising of water buffalo.
In 2020, the farm participated in a competitive selection process and received an AGROSTARTUP grant for the development of a meat-farming business.
These funds were used to purchase a tractor trailer, two press harvesters, and a mower.
The head of the farm increases its livestock each year and boosts its overall meat production.
In addition to this, the KFH grows annual fodder crops on a land area of 40 hectares.
In Stalin's plans, Mogzoeva was supposed to open a feeding station.
Following his visit to three farms, the head of the district noted that measures of state support are effective, necessary, and crucial.
- The government of Irkutsk region pays great attention to agriculture.
Therefore, state support should not only be maintained, but also increased and raised.
For our part, we must be the guarantors of food security.
Agricultural producers in the district are fulfilling this role with honour, emphasised Anatoly Prokopyev.
The crossing on the Armenian-Turkish border was opened for the delivery of humanitarian aid for the first time in decades
The Margara-Aldzhan border crossing on the border between Turkey and Armenia was opened for the first time in three decades to deliver humanitarian aid to those affected by the earthquake.
Turkish and Armenian media outlets are reporting on this.
This same crossing was used to deliver humanitarian aid from Turkey to Armenia after the devastating earthquake in 1988, notes the Turkish agency Anadolu.
On Saturday, Armenia sent five trucks with 100 tons of food, medicine, water, and other emergency aid supplies to the city of Aydıaman in southern Turkey, reported Serdar Kılıç, the special representative of Ankara for Armenian-Turkish negotiations.
He expressed his gratitude to the Vice Speaker of the Parliament of Armenia, Ruben Rubinyan, and the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Armenia, Vahan Kostanyan.
"I will always remember the assistance provided by the people of Armenia to alleviate the suffering of our people in the earthquake-stricken region," Kılıç wrote on his Twitter page.
In turn, the press secretary of the Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Vaan Unanyan, reported that the trucks carrying humanitarian aid crossed the border via the Margara bridge and are heading towards the region affected by the earthquake.
As reported by Public Radio of Armenia, the last time a vehicle crossed the Margahar bridge was 30 years ago, in 1993.
Since then, the Armenian-Turkish land border has been closed.
The Turkish news agency "Anadolu" cites different data and writes that the border crossing point of Margara-Aldzhan was last used to deliver humanitarian aid to Armenia in order to address the aftermath of the devastating earthquake of 1988.
At that time, aid collected through the Turkish Red Crescent was sent to the disaster zone in Armenia.
Earlier, Armenia sent 27 rescuers to Turkey and another 29 rescuers to the earthquake-stricken areas of Syria.
According to the latest data, more than 25 thousand people have died in Turkey and Syria due to the devastating earthquake that occurred on Monday.
On February 11, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reported that 21,848 deaths had already been confirmed in Turkey.
The Syrian side reported 3,553 deaths.
Relations between Turkey and Armenia are mainly clouded by the fact that Ankara refuses to recognize the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire, and also supported Baku during the First and Second Karabakh wars.
Recently, Yerevan and Ankara have made a number of attempts to normalize their relations.
In 2021, Armenia and Turkey appointed special representatives who met several times in Vienna to discuss issues related to normalization.
In February 2022, commercial air traffic between Yerevan and Istanbul resumed after a two-year hiatus.
In July 2022, Ankara and Yerevan agreed to open the land border for citizens of third countries as soon as possible.

"Sabmishn of the Year".

Crespo named the strengths of Enzo Fernandez, who joined Chelsea for 121 million euros
Former Argentine national team player Hernán Crespo commented on the transfer of Benfica midfielder Enzo Fernández to London Chelsea.
In particular, he stated that he was impressed with the player's performance at the recent World Cup.
According to him, the 22-year-old midfielder will be a great addition to the "blue" team, as he knows how to play in different positions.
"Fernandez is a combination of Makelele and Lampard.
If you need him to play in the position of Makélélé, then he can play there very well.
This guy also has a good sense of where the goal is, a good shot from outside the penalty area, so if you need him to play as a striker, like Lampard or Essien, he can do it," Krespo told the British media.
As a reminder, Enzo Fernandez moved to Chelsea for 121 million euros.
He played in 7 matches at the 2022 World Cup, scoring 1 goal and making 1 assist.

Prediction for the match of the Club World Championship between Real and Al-Hilal on February 11, 2023
The final of the club world football championship will take place on February 11 at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in the Moroccan city of Rabat.
In the trophy match, Real Madrid will face Al-Hilal from Saudi Arabia.
The game will start at 22:00 Moscow time, and a live broadcast will begin at 21:55 MSK on the website matchtv.ru and the television channel "Match! Football 2".
Analysts at the bookmaking company BETCITY consider the "Blancos" huge favorites: you can bet on Real Madrid winning in regular time with a coefficient of 1.28, with a probability of approximately 77%.
Success for nominal guests is available for 11.0 (8%).
Even the draw is offered at a significantly lower odds of 6.10 (15%).
Do you believe that the teams won't determine the strongest one in 90 minutes?
A bet of 1000 rubles on a "peaceful" outcome will earn 6100 rubles in the event of a win.
You can bet on the triumph of the Madrid team, including extra time and a penalty shootout, at 1.14; this market for Al-Hilal is at 5.80.
The team from Saudi Arabia made it to the final after overcoming two rounds, defeating Moroccan’s “Wydad” in a penalty shootout and Brazilian “Flamenco” in regular time (3:2).
You can bet that the underdog will at least not lose to the Europeans in 90 minutes for 3.90.
Analysts anticipate a high number of goals: the total over 2.5 goals is available at 1.53, TM 2.5 at 2.60.
Blancos are clearly superior to their opponents in terms of class, the composition of whose team, according to the statistics website Transfermarkt, amounts to only 39.6 million euros.
For comparison’s sake: the roster of Real Madrid is valued at 849 million euros.
In addition, to the horror of Al-Ahly, the main attacker for Real Madrid and current holder of the Golden Ball, Karim Benzema, will be fit to play in the final.
But even without the Frenchman, Real is performing well in this tournament: in the semi-finals they defeated the Egyptian team Al-Ahly 4-1.
The matches of the Arabian team were also quite exciting: they drew 1:1 in the quarterfinals and won in a penalty shootout, and in the semifinals they won a dramatic 3:2 match.
Recommended bet: victory for Real Madrid and TB 2.5 at 1.76.
Guberniev commented on the fact that midfielder Pavel Mamaev has decided to end his playing career.
Famous television commentator Dmitry Guberniev stated that midfielder Pavel Mamaev has decided to end his playing career.
“Now it will be possible to cast a bust of the hero in his homeland.
He made a big mistake and for most people he will be remembered not as a football player, but as a rule-breaking football player.
But he is still far behind Kokorin.
Because no one was able to demonstrate their potential as impressively as Kokorin did.
Despite all his talents, Mamaev was not always in the spotlight.
I can only wish him good luck and hope he finds success elsewhere", Metaratings.ru quotes Guberenieva as saying.
The last club of the 34-year-old midfielder was "Himki".
The suburban club did not renew the contract with the midfielder in the summer of 2022.
Previously, Mamaev played for Torpedo, CSKA, Krasnodar, and Rostov.
Mamaev is a Russian champion, three-time winner of the Russian Cup, and two-time winner of the country’s Super Cup with CSKA.

A tanker with a diesel engine from a previously Russian-flagged vessel was not allowed into the port of Spain
The Tarragona Naval Command of the Main Directorate for the Commercial Fleet under the Spanish Ministry of Transport has prohibited the Maersk Magellan from entering the port to unload diesel fuel, since the cargo comes from the Nobel vessel, which flew the Russian flag until July 1, 2022, according to the Spanish Ministry of Transport.
"The Maritime Command of the Tarragona Directorate General of Merchant Shipping under the Ministry of Transport, Mobility, and Urban Agenda has prohibited the entry into the port of Tarragona for the unloading of diesel fuel from the vessel Maersk Magellan, flying the flag of Singapore, because the cargo it is carrying comes from the vessel Noble, flying the flag of Cameroon, which until July 1, 2022, sailed under the Russian flag," states the ministry's statement.
This measure was taken in accordance with European Union legislation, which prohibits access to any vessel registered under the Russian flag as of April 16, 2022, or that has changed its flag after February 24, 2022.
The ministry specified that the inspection was conducted on February 9, after which the ban was agreed upon.
The ministry recalled that this is not the first time that ships have been prohibited from entering Spanish ports.
In April 2022, the port of Barcelona denied access to the Maltese-flagged vessel Black Star, which was transporting cargo from a vessel flying the Russian flag.
In 2022, following the strengthening of anti-Russian sanctions by the EU, the US, and Great Britain, restrictions were imposed on the supply of Russian petroleum products, and then they decided to limit fuel prices.
Since December 5, 2022, a price cap on sea shipments of oil from Russia has been in effect, imposed by unfriendly countries.
At that time, a ceiling was set for Russian oil at $60 per barrel.
An EU embargo on sea shipments of oil from Russia has also been in effect since December 5.
The problems with entry into Argentina faced by pregnant Russian women have been explained.
According to the expert, against the backdrop of the influx of people wanting to have children in Argentina, the country's authorities have become more attentive to the entry of foreign citizens into their territory.
The difficulties with entry for pregnant Russian women into Argentina are connected to the fact that the country’s authorities are not interested in a mass influx of foreigners who want to obtain citizenship for their children and a residence permit for themselves, only to then leave.
Lenta.ru reports on this, citing Professor Viktor Heifetz of SPbGU, editor-in-chief of the magazine "Latin America".
According to him, no country supports such practices.
He noted that Argentina does not approve of turning the country into a transit point rather than a final destination.
This applies to those who violate constitutional practices.
As the expert explained, the child will retain Argentine citizenship, but the decision on whether to grant Argentine citizenship to the parents after they receive a residence permit will be made by the court.
If it turns out that they did not actually live in Argentina and immediately left the country, they may be denied citizenship.
This applies not only to Russians, but also to citizens of other countries.
Recently, as the specialist pointed out, maternity tours to Argentina have become especially popular among Russians and Ukrainians.
Argentina grants citizenship based on the ‘right of soil’, meaning if a person was born on its territory.
The Argentine passport provides the opportunity for visa-free travel to 170 countries, including EU states and the United Kingdom.
Earlier it was reported that Argentina had begun to revoke residence permits for Russians who had obtained them through the birth of a child, but then left the country.
Buenos Aires is interested in reducing the number of such incidents.
It has also been reported that six pregnant Russian citizens were denied entry into Argentina on suspicion of providing false information about the purpose of their trip.
In Russia, the opening of hundreds of new fitness clubs is predicted.

This year, more than 400 new facilities may open in the country, primarily small-format ones.
About 400 new fitness clubs may open in Russia, and their total number may increase by 5 percent.
As Kommersant reports, several dozen players may leave the Russian market as a result.
By the end of the year, there will be approximately 8,600 clubs in Russia.
According to the publication, the majority of new clubs are small-scale projects with small initial investments and quick payback periods.
These figures are provided by representatives of the National Fitness Community.
In a conversation with the publication, Olga Kisileva, president of the Association of Fitness Industry Operators, noted that the 340-420 new fitness clubs will be small, while the rest will occupy an area of more than 500 square metres.
The president of the NFS, Elena Silina, noted that since 2020, there have been more club closures than openings each year.
Over the past three years, their numbers have decreased by 37 percent.
At the same time, independent analysts cite different figures.
According to data from "Kontur.Fokus", over the past three years the number of organizations with the primary type of activity "fitness center operations" has grown by 10.1 percent, and there are now 5,120 of them.
The industry suffered significant losses due to the pandemic, but as early as 2021 it began to recover.
According to data from 2GIS, there are 4,500 fitness clubs in Russian cities with over a million inhabitants.
Russians have started paying more attention to physical activity, as evidenced by the increase in attendance at fitness clubs.
As of January 2023, attendance increased by 9.3 percent year over year.
As Silina noted, if the trend continues, the industry will return to pre-crisis levels by the end of the year.

In the Kirov Region, a decision by the regional Arbitration Court has revoked the business licence for managing multi-apartment buildings previously issued to the management company "Za borotu" (For the common good).
According to data from the regional State Housing Inspectorate, the court decision was made back in November 2022, but it only came into legal force in February 2023.
The arbitration committee revoked the management company’s licence for repeatedly failing to comply with the requirements of the State Housing Inspectorate.
Currently, all the facilities that were under the management of Zabota have been removed from the register of licences for the operation of businesses involved in the management of multi-apartment buildings.
Their total area was 64.8 thousand square metres.
All of the houses are located in the regional center.
The administration of Kirov is aware of the fact that they have been left without a management company.
In accordance with Russian legislation, the State Housing Inspectorate informed the mayor about the situation.
It should be noted that in January 2023, the governor of the Kirov Region, Alexander Sokolov, set a goal for employees of the State Housing Inspectorate to eliminate two-thirds of the region's management companies by spring, as there are simply too many of them.
The legality of the governor's demands has been called into question by the Communist Party in Kirov.
They contacted the regional prosecutor’s office and asked that Sokolov be held administratively liable.
Presumably, the Federal Antimonopoly Service could have taken the same position.
Antimonopoly officials also allegedly asked the prosecutor's office to verify the legality of the actions of the regional head.
Wildberries will make package pick-up services paid services at its pick-up points
The marketplace Wildberries will make package pick-up services paid starting on February 13.
Their cost will range from 6 to 15 rubles.
Now, the packages are delivered by the owners of the pickup points.
In the absence of these documents, a fine is imposed.
Starting Monday, February 13th, it will no longer be possible to pick up packages from Wildberries distribution points for free.
Users of the marketplace received a notification stating that buyers who need the package will have to pay 6 to 15 rubles for it.
This amount will be debited from the card specified in your personal account.
As indicated by the company, this step will help reduce the use of plastic and will contribute to the preservation of nature.
As can be seen from the appendix to the offer for the provision of delivery services to individuals, the contractor, i.e., the person who opened the pickup point, must provide the packages free of charge at the request of the customer.
At the same time, they must be designed in specific colours and feature a specified image.
The packages are purchased by the owners of PVO facilities, and if this obligation is not fulfilled, a fine of 10,000 rubles is imposed for each violation.
Earlier, Wildberries customers accused the platform of debiting money from cards whose data had previously been deleted from their personal accounts.
As buyers fear, this is fraught with major security risks.
In turn, the support service explained that this is stipulated by the user agreement.
According to the document, the company has the right to debit money from remote cards without notifying the customer if payment from other sources fails for one reason or another.
In a statement commenting on the situation, the company stated that payments to customers are made with the customers' permission, and that there can be no data breach involving bank cards.
Photos from February 2023.
This is a beautiful spot, especially in the summer, with a mammoth sculpture and a gazebo with grills nearby.
On the premises there is a small park where you can take a walk with your family.
Large car park.
The store is located on the first floor of the Univer City shopping center.
Hours of operation are from 10:00 to 22:00.
You can drink coffee and snack on fresh pastries in the store.
There is a small parking lot near the shopping center.
Friendly staff!
Delicious coffee, a wide selection of syrups, and alternative types of milk.
Delicious fresh baked goods😍😍😍.
Hearty sandwiches.
A convenient cafeteria area
They came with their daughter to process her pension.
They welcomed me warmly, explained everything clearly, scanned my documents, filled out the application form, and told me how to sign up for future appointments.
At the entrance, the administrator and security personnel greet you in a cultured and respectful manner.
The building is decent, everything is set up for people – there is a hall, a toilet, but a cooler with water wouldn’t hurt to have.
We visited twice and everything was great!
I wish all workers peace, good fortune, success, and a decent salary during these difficult times for everyone!!!
Simply a wonderful place!
After a long walk on the beach, there is nothing better than sitting by the window with a cup of glühwein, waiting for the shrimp salad (which is absolutely delicious!!!) to arrive.
I highly recommend this wonderful place!!!)))
A sweet cashier asked me if I wanted coffee in the lobby, 200 or 300 ml.
I asked for a 300 ml cup in the restaurant.
A couple of minutes later, they give me a plastic cup.
I wanted to work with ceramics, which is why I ended up in the “ceramics room”.
They did this to me.
I ask why it is in a small glass, and not in a cup.
The girl responds by saying that they don’t have cups with a capacity of 300 ml.
How does this make sense in the mind of a person?
Ask yourself this question or in the store, in other words, determine for yourself which technology to use: pouring coffee into a cup or a disposable cup.
To get an answer, you need to go to the room, i.e. to the cup.
Specify the volume.
To hear that 300 ml.
Make the person face the fact that there are no cups of that size.
Here, take this paper cup, it holds 300 ml.
It is noteworthy that this is the third such incident in the Green Haven that I can remember.
It is all the more noteworthy that I was not offered a standard cup so that I could pour the contents of the plastic cup into it and drink the coffee the way I want to. I asked for it myself.
A number of questions arise.
1. Are the Green Corner Cafe and Green Corner two separate entities, or are they part of the same organization?
If unrelated things are brought together, understanding arises.
If they are related – why would a food and retail business known in the city for its service and quality stoop to the level of rhetoric used by a pushcart vendor at Kazan Station?
This is all rhetoric because, I repeat, this is the third time something like this has happened to me.
I don’t rule out the possibility that this is happening not only to me.
2. Does the cashier have instructions?
I have the impression that she acts on impulse.
I hope I'm wrong.
Please outline the actions your employees should take in this case, if they are trying to provide service.
We really like the circus and have been going there since we were kids.
I have seen numbers registered to Mr Nikulin Yu.
And now it’s also with their children, their nephews.
I like the atmosphere at the circus, and I also like the shows.
The location of the venues is very convenient.
From almost any point, the arena is visible, and the backs of those seated in front of you do not obstruct your view.
The circus is very intimate and family-oriented!
this time we went to see the New Year's show.
They were a bit disappointed.
Lots of clowns and acrobats.
I would like a room with tricks and more animals.
It’s a shame that you can no longer take photos with the animals in the foyer.
But apparently there are reasons for this.
And overall, it is a very pleasant place!!
I wish you prosperity and hope you will continue to delight us with your performances!!!
I liked the developer, Otbestroy, which chooses good locations for building residential complexes.
They use high-quality materials, which fully justifies the price.
Before making the purchase, we were invited to take a look at the complex, even though the walls weren’t yet built, so that we could see everything firsthand, even though we viewed dozens of apartments and no developer ever offered us this opportunity.
Favourite ski resort in Russia!
The most fun is in the gentle, sparse forests, especially when there is a lot of soft snow.
As for the tracks, in my opinion they are boring and too short.
The longest ones in the sector e are even shorter.
But overall, there’s a great atmosphere, with lots of different cafes and bars, so a fun skiing vibe is guaranteed!
Excellent work, Peri master!
I did everything as quickly and efficiently as possible, and the interior of the car was clean and pleasant.
The service is good, the staff are friendly, there is a cloakroom and water is provided.
Absolutely horrible service.
The second time I arrived to pick up my order at the time specified in the app, but I waited by the window for more than 30 minutes for my order.
Today, such a service is unacceptable in business!
The response from the "care" department is that we are trying.
At the box office, even without an apology, simply because we are not to blame, it’s the program.
You couldn’t call to warn them, and you didn’t find any other technical means of communication with your previously loyal customers.
Impotent men “try”, while businesses need to operate.
Thank you all, goodbye.
We will not be ordering from you again, and we will not be recommending you either.
A bad mood, the anticipation of guests, the hostess’ apologies – these are not the best accompaniments to hot rolls.
I ordered a car (Jeep Wrangler Sahara) through this organization.
The car was supposed to be delivered in 3–3.5 months (as agreed), but it actually took 4.5 months – the delay was caused by the situation on the border between Lithuania and Belarus (Lithuania was responsible for the delay).
In the end, I am very satisfied with the car, thank you to the guys - Dmitry, Stas, and Alexander - who are always available, provide up-to-date information, offer professional advice, and maintain a good attitude.
Thank you again!
We rented a cottage for 4 days for 3 people.
The cabins are clean, cozy, and warm (even very warm), and they have their own small kitchen with coffee, tea, sugar, spices, sunflower oil, and all the necessary dishes.
Cleaning supplies and a sponge are available.
Among the drawbacks, one could mention the fact that there is not enough space, and the shower in the bathroom is incredibly small.
There are no designated areas for storing snowboards or skis, and there is nowhere to dry clothes, so we had to borrow a dryer from the owners and use it in place of a chair, and place a heater underneath it.
On the whole, it’s not a bad option in a quiet area.
Stylish, clean, spacious.
The food is delicious, and the selection of dishes is sufficient to meet the needs of any guest.
The prices are reasonable.
There is wine and beer for those who want to drink.
I recommend the center of Moscow.
A wonderful place with very polite staff, we will definitely be coming back.
The property has all necessary amenities, including parking and a pool table.
Rooms with good decor and all necessary amenities.
A beautiful and aesthetically pleasing place, we walked around it during our visit to Kaliningrad.
I really enjoyed it, both the miniature Russia and the Ozerov Park and its landscape.
In the winter, there are plenty of natural hills for kids to play on)
A really cool tobacco and hookah shop)
We constantly make purchases here, the prices are low, and the quality is top-notch!
The staff are very helpful and will gladly answer any questions you may have)
I highly recommend this store for a visit! ❤️
Location is where you want it to be.
For me personally, that is normal.
They serve quickly, provided none of the customers mess things up.
It’s convenient to make an appointment.
The staff is attentive and will offer assistance, provide directions, and offer advice even if you come outside of regular business hours.
In principle, that's fine.
Great guys!
Thank you so much!
Everything was done quickly and efficiently, and the prices are reasonable compared to other services.
I thought it was a remote control for the release mechanism, and they are all so clever that they did it all for me.
A huge thank you to these young guys!
I ordered a bouquet of 21 tulips with delivery 2 hours before March 8th.
They delivered the flowers in a package that looked like it had been stolen (there was barely enough paper to wrap the flowers).
Later, when the flowers were already in the vase, I realised that something was wrong.
I compared it to the photo on the website and the color was completely different from what I ordered.
I decided to count them again, and it turned out that there were an even number of tulips, 20 in total.
The support team on Vkontakte responded to my complaints about the color and quantity of flowers with "apparently they mixed up the colors".
The next day I wrote again and was offered a refund of 15%.
It seems to me that this is the ultimate degree of impudence and most likely falls under the definition of fraud.
I have already submitted a request to the tax authorities regarding the fact that they refused to issue me a receipt.
Rosпотребnadzor and the court are next in line.
I would not recommend anyone to deal with this organization.
For more than 10 years I have been going to Samira, a hairstylist, for hair coloring and haircuts.
I want to cancel The professionalism of master Samira is outstanding, she does a great job and I am always satisfied with her work.
She always listens carefully to the client’s wishes, and the client is always satisfied with the results.
I would wholeheartedly recommend this master to all family and friends.
All of her work is always of the highest quality!!’
A huge thank you to Master Samira 😍
I visited this gaming club and I have to say the prices are great, there are plenty of gaming computers, and they also serve drinks and food.
Some of the keyboards have broken keys that fly off when typing, and if we’re talking about “standard gaming performance”, the computers are not very powerful. :)
Therefore, the rating is 4🥸
This place has become our family tradition.)
The son goes to his group for training, and his mother goes to the fitbox in the evening.
The administrators are extremely attentive, and the trainers are professional.
They organize themed parties for children, and keep an eye on cleanliness and the exercise equipment.
It’s nice to go and train.
A 6-year-old child can already withstand a strong blow and strong OCP.
Recommended for children, moms, and dads).
The best craftsmen!
Irina is simply gold!!
The work is done to a high standard, with attention to detail, and everything is clarified.
You can always talk about something with girls!
This is the third time!
I wouldn't regret it for anything!
Finally, I can grow my hair after bleaching it! !!!
Vita is also studying color theory.
That is why it will soon be possible to combine blonde hair with keratin!
And your hair will thank you🥰🥰
The master receptionist, Elena Polianskaya, is a very responsive person who clearly explained everything that is included in a routine maintenance checkup.
She also provided assistance during the time my car was being repaired.
And also our thanks to master Valeriy Ushakov for his attentive and professional work.
He was ready to answer any question.
The work was done to a high standard.
The only thing that confused me when I had the service done was the insufficiently accurate information about the work regulations, but when I showed up for the service, the regulations were explained more clearly.
I want to express my deepest gratitude to the staff of the Administration.
We needed a very rare certificate from the child welfare agency to approve the real estate transaction, and the employees were very helpful and assisted us in obtaining this certificate, although they could have refused to do so since it is not part of their duties.
Thank you very much!
The people who work here are very nice.
The staff are wonderful, warm, and polite, and I am glad I came to this particular hair salon!👍
Master Nahid did an impeccable hair coloring and haircut, took into account and understood all of my wishes, I would definitely recommend her to everyone❤️
I really enjoyed myself in the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin.
It was restored for its 800th anniversary and everything inside is stylish and clean.
There are also cafes and restrooms for tourists.
I went on a tour, which was also great.
And I would definitely recommend the Russian collection of the Nizhny Novgorod art museum – it has an unexpectedly wonderful collection
I have known Olya for more than 3 years and we have been using her services regularly.
During this time, we have seen how Olya has developed in her chosen field, is constantly learning new things, and how the space for animals is expanding, which only inspires admiration and trust.
We always leave our puppy with a calm mind.
Daily video reports will be made, and if necessary, the animals will be picked up/transported by a zoocab.
And they will also bring some delicious and fresh food).
in general, it’s a fairy tale 🥰
We would like to thank you for your care and attentive personal approach to our pets 🐕💜
The Restaurant Sytyi Los' is located near the Medvedkovo metro station.
The restaurant is very cozy!
They prepare delicious dishes.
The menu is varied.
It is advisable to reserve seats in advance before visiting, especially on Fridays!
A lovely well-maintained zoo.
It’s smaller than Moscow’s, but just as interesting and convenient.
It was a weekday – the entrance fee for adults was 300₽, and for schoolchildren 170₽.
Not many people showed up, but we had a great time and enjoyed looking at the animals.
The myrmecophaga impressed me)
By the way, they haven’t seen him in Moscow.
There are a couple of cafes on the premises with reasonable prices, the restrooms are clean and free to use, and we also saw a charging station for phones.
Overall, I recommend it 👍
The interior is top-notch!!!
I am very satisfied with the services of cosmetologist Kuznetsova Natalia, I only go to her.
I perform various types of facial cleansing – both with a machine and manually.
I am 100% satisfied.
A master of their craft👍
She explained everything in detail about my skin type and helped me choose the right skincare products, and they are simply perfect.
I now feel happy and beautiful!!!
Thank you, Natalia!!!
A great club with plenty of space, a swimming pool, sauna, hammam, and excellent trainers!
The downside is the huge number of pensioners in the pool and locker room area.
It feels like they come to the club as if it were a public bathhouse!
Particular emphasis on the women's section.
During the week, starting at 7 PM, there are a lot of people!
I’m giving it a three, and only because of the first visit, when I saw a consultant, if I’m not mistaken it was Timur, but I could be mistaken.
I processed everything quickly, explained everything clearly, my son also decided to apply for a card, and alas, the consultants were busy with their own affairs, clients were waiting, a consultant eventually approached my son, who was very knowledgeable about everything, and went into the consultation room several times to chat and joke around, in the end my son left without applying, and the consultant said, well, you can do whatever you want, but since I was present during this meeting, I was surprised.
The new office, in the new format, is comfortable and everything is so convenient.
It’s a shame that the first impression was ruined, now we visit another branch, and the attitude towards customers there doesn’t depend on the changing staff.
The selection is very large, the quality is good (the fabric resists pilling), the staff know their products and are helpful in choosing styles.
It is possible to dress both a slender child and a child with an unusual figure and height.
They are located close to the subway station, and there is even a small parking lot.
We recommend it!
I was there in September, celebrating my birthday.
In principle, I was pleased with the service and the quality of the food: the prices are low, the portions are of a medium size, so you can eat until you are full or order again.
The only complaint is the reservation process for a table.
When I placed the order, I provided my phone number and everything else that was required, after which I immediately received a call from the bot to verify my phone.
After that, there is nothing left.
When he arrived at the restaurant itself, it turned out that the table had not been reserved.
It was lucky that there were free seats and we were able to be seated.
Actually, it’s a really good restaurant with an excellent price-to-quality ratio.
I recommend it!
I went for a cleaning last weekend.
This is the first time I’ve seen such an organized staff, who took a maximum amount of care with my questions, and advised me on what and how to do for further treatment of my mouth.
I wholeheartedly recommend it, the only clinic where they don't try to rip you off that I can remember.
A good shopping center.
Everything is here!
A wide range of products.
A variety of shops.
You can always find something that suits your taste.
From food to gifts.
I will never step foot in this store again.
they bought a washing machine, saying that it was for outside the city, so we would pick it up ourselves.
The manager in the warehouse said where to drive up to, when asked if they would “load” it, they said yes.)
they took it out of the box at the warehouse, and when asked why, they replied that this is how everything is loaded.
when I started insisting, they stuck two strips of foam rubber in me, like, it’ll be fine!
They refused to load the trailer, saying it wasn’t their job, and that they would load it themselves, as they have their own delivery service)”
When I said that I would then cancel the order altogether, they said "whatever you want, it doesn't matter to us"; in the end, one of them even went so far as to come down from the ramp and help my father put the car in the trailer.
This is the first time I have experienced such rude service.
A good shopping center. Everything is very neat. A wide selection of shops and cafes with restaurants.
There is a Kосмик movie theater and the entertainment center for children "Nevidailia".
On the lower level there is a large Lenta hypermarket.
Convenient, large parking lot and great location.
A good supermarket for cosmetics, underwear, and household goods.
A wide range of products, reasonable prices, polite and attentive staff.
The consultants will definitely help you with your choice and provide advice.
Everyone will find something necessary for themselves.
A great place to spend an evening.
The staff are very good, a pleasant establishment.
I would recommend everyone to never make a mistake in their choice of venue. The best place in Krasnodar where you can relax and have a great time is absolutely superb.
I recommend you visit)
We would like to express our gratitude to Chasova Marina, who acted as our agent for organizing the funeral.
When she came to us at our request, she took charge of all the issues related to this difficult and sad event, helped us choose everything we needed, was always available and kept us informed about how things were progressing.
Thanks to her, we were able to give a proper send-off to our loved one.
Everything was done in a professional manner, as we had discussed during our first meeting.
Marina, who is well aware of the state of her loved ones, offered advice on how to proceed and simply showed her sympathy towards us.
He is a very good specialist in his field.
Thank you for everything.
Having been swayed by the many positive reviews, I contacted RemStirMash and they assigned me to work with master Alexander.
He began the conversation by saying that the next day he would be completely free and ready to help.
They discussed everything and set a time – 2 pm.
The next day arrived – a call in the morning from the master saying that he wouldn’t be able to come, a complicated request (what is this all about? and where is the “complete availability”?), and if he is able to come, he will arrive after 18:00 instead of at 14:00 as scheduled.
We agreed to meet again the following day.
15 minutes before the scheduled time, another master calls and says that someone other than Alexander may arrive, but not for another 2 hours.
What kind of tricks are these?
One and a half days of empty waiting, all my scheduled tasks put on hold!
In short, a competent technician named Ivan arrived, fixed the problem, for which I am grateful.
So don’t fall for empty promises and don’t waste your time.
The evening observations did not live up to expectations at all.
First, there was a short lecture with incomprehensible material, followed by a telescope observation.
Everything was not very well organized; children kept trying to sneak in multiple times, and adults were crowded together and couldn’t let others in.
The objects we observed through the telescope were the size of a regular star, and you can observe them without a telescope for free.
The girl’s answers to questions were not very clear, as she didn’t understand that ordinary people are not familiar with many of the nuances.
It is not clear why they were charged 600₽.
An amazing place, one of the oldest Mexican restaurants in the city, it has been around since the early 2000s.
A cozy atmosphere, always friendly service.
The price is average.
You can sit down and order 2-3 dishes for two (the portions are very generous) + a cocktail, for around 2500 rubles👌
There are some interesting beer-based cocktails, such as the Macho Boracho, which I highly recommend trying.
Price: 420 RUB for 0.5 l.
And in general, the cuisine at the restaurant itself is very tasty, I don’t know how it is for others, but I really enjoyed it, and I will definitely recommend it to my friends)
This is a great store, I have been buying products from them for quite some time now, since they first opened.
Good quality products.
I bought a mixer five years ago and it still works perfectly and is in good condition.
That is why, when we renovated the apartment, we bought everything we needed from this store.
Excellent gas station!!!
It is located in a very convenient location, close to both the city center and the countryside, in short, it’s very convenient)!
The quality of the gas is good, I fill up twice a week for more than 2 years now, and I haven’t had any problems, and the price is great!!!
Orphans charge by the map and cash, and they don’t cheat you based on the litre rate.
I liked the store!
You can choose any model at a democratic price, and for any purpose!
The staff is always ready to help with your selection.
I lent my daughter my laptop for studying, since hers was broken.
They helped, found a suitable option, and provided a guarantee (for a month). Thank you! 👍
A sommelier is working.
he helped me choose a wine, because it’s difficult to figure it out on your own with such a large menu.
Vasily is an interesting and charming sommelier with valuable experience, and there aren’t enough of them like him in Moscow.
I ate the pike-perch – it was magical, and I give the chef my thanks.
The children's menu is the same as everywhere else: pasta, fries, chicken nuggets. I ordered pizza, it's AMAZING here!
Adults enjoyed the truffles, while children preferred the sausage and mushrooms.
My husband ate smoked ribs – they were amazing, tender, juicy, and flavorful.
The staff are great, all of them are smiling and friendly.
We liked it.
The brand new WB order pickup point is located in a convenient location.
Working hours are from 10:00 to 21:00, without weekends or holidays.
There are dressing rooms inside the PVZ.
A very good place.
Real professionals work here who are always ready to help.
There is also a group and chat on Vkontakte for informative communication.
Fast delivery.
It’s great that you can immediately see and try on the merchandise.
It’s great that it’s located near my house.
A great, modern hotel.
The room is spacious, very clean, and cozy.
Everything stated in the description is available in stock.
Breakfast is included in the price, with a wide selection of dishes to suit all tastes.
Convenient entrance, private parking lot near the entrance.
Hard 5.
A wonderful puppet theater.
We often go to see different performances.
Today we went to see the play "The Little Mermaid".
At the moment, this is the best thing for children's performances.
It was really interesting, with lots of puppets and special effects.
Even my 14-year-old son went along just for the company, but he said that it was a really good show.
I vacationed with my husband for 10 days in January 2023.
The vacation was a success, we loved everything!
I’ll start in order:
On the day of arrival, we received a call to confirm the expected pickup time and were provided with information about the cost of the transfer (1400 RUB from the airport); we ordered a taxi (at 23:00 the fare was 850 RUB), and we arrived quickly without encountering any traffic; they let us pass through the gate without any issues.
The administrative building is nearby, and they processed everything quickly, in about 15-20 minutes.
All the buildings have an elevator, which is a big plus!
The 2-bed room is spacious, with warm floors in both the room and bathroom (without heating), and a huge balcony with rattan furniture (table and two chairs); panoramic windows (in building 5).
The furniture in the room is normal, there is a ladies' table with a large mirror, the fridge is not exactly small, and there is even a freezer.
There are a lot of green plants in building 5.
Everything is clean, they change the towels and linens as you wish, but if you don’t ask for a change, they still change them on the fourth day, and the linens are of good quality.
The territory is well-maintained, there are benches everywhere, the sidewalks are clean, and in the evening there is beautiful lighting.
A minibus runs to the beach and back every 30 minutes.
It takes 5 minutes to reach a stop for public transport.
The guys in the dining hall are friendly and always wish you a good day.
The food is decent, but everyone has their own preferences and we were all satisfied. The selection and quality were good, there was always fish and chicken, or other options, vegetables as a side dish every day, homemade tasty pastries, more than four types of drinks, coffee made from beans, they always bake pancakes for breakfast, but the cheese and sausage aren’t very good.
The medical staff are very friendly and loyal.
We were also lucky with the weather – there was no rain, the temperature was 11–16°C, and there was sunshine.
Everyone enjoyed themselves and truly had a restful vacation.
There is a desire to come back again, and specifically in January when there are fewer vacationers).
It is a shame that the swimming pool and the fitness centre will not be put into operation.
Thank you to the entire team of the sanatorium for their well-coordinated and high-quality work!
We have been going to Polot since August.
Daughter turned 4 in September.
She is the one who likes everything, the coach praises her) and that is the most important thing.
We’re going to see Valeria Nikolaevna Pleshkova!)
I never would have thought that my daughter was so flexible!
While wandering around the streets of Saint Petersburg, my friends and I decided to check out this promising establishment — and we were not disappointed!
The prices are very reasonable, and the incredibly delicious pizza disappears in the blink of an eye, leaving not a crumb behind.
A pleasant atmosphere and charming staff, in short, I recommend it :)
It so happened that I ended up in Tomarovskaya Hospital with high blood pressure and a racing heart.
I was extremely surprised: the place was spotlessly clean, everything was in order, there was even a wet cleaning twice a day, and in addition, the windowsills, furniture, and doors were all dusted.
The food is baby food, but it’s really good!!!
I was surprised that they brought tea with a sandwich (bread, butter, cheese) at 7 in the morning, so to speak, as a pre-breakfast meal.
The medical staff are very attentive, everyone is getting both intramuscular and intravenous injections!!!
As long as the drip is in place, they will come in, ask how you are feeling...
I have had heart ultrasounds before, but this was the first time (unfortunately, I don’t know the name of the doctor, he was a young man).
Special thanks to the attending physician, Vetokhina Klavdia Fedorovna!
A true professional: attentive, knowledgeable, providing a comprehensive answer to any question; she selected the right dosage and medications that normalized both my blood pressure and heart rate, something I was previously unable to achieve after consulting other doctors.
Many thanks to the chief physician, Mevsha Olga Vladimirovna, who organized the coordinated work of the hospital!!!
Thanks to the medical staff, the cleaning staff, and everyone else!
The experience of visiting the customer service department left a good impression.
The administrator greeted me at the chole.
The competent and polite specialists quickly and patiently help customers with all their questions.
The specialist provided assistance with the submission of the application and provided clarification regarding my question.
For a small store, this is a very good selection of products.
There are semi-finished products, milk, vegetables, household chemicals, and all sorts of other small items.
It is open 24 hours a day, which is very convenient, and the staff are always friendly.
It's great when there is a place in the city where you can go skiing.
The bubble lifts certainly have lines on weekends – there’s a 40-second wait to go down and a 5-10 minute wait in line.
But on the whole, it was great, immersing oneself in an atmosphere of positivity and winter, even if there is mud and dampness on the roads.
I contacted a service center for repairs of the iPhone 11 Pro.
The rear window was shattered and the battery needed to be replaced.
I contacted the master, Alexander, who explained all the details of the repair and immediately provided me with a price range.
Thank you for the renovation work, everything was done to a high standard.
The masters are very pleasant to talk to, they will show everything and tell you all about it.
However, during the replacement of parts, the camera was damaged, causing a loss of focus.
I immediately reported the problem and received a quick response.
The error was corrected as quickly as possible, and everything is now working properly.
This service has good specialists with whom it is a pleasure to have a dialogue.
The prices, in comparison with other services, are reasonable and affordable.
If the repairs need to be done again, I will definitely contact them!
It’s grand, beautiful, and atmospheric.
But, like most historical sites, the condition requires close, prompt, and high-quality attention from restoration specialists.
That is why 4 and most of these stars are given to creators, rather than maintainers.
Great apartment building.
The concierges are responsive, the trash is collected, the premises are clean and well-maintained, and it’s close to bus stops, schools, and shops.
20 minutes to the subway by public transportation
We opened a nice, cozy place for recreation in our area.
All necessary shops are available.
A fantastic and diverse food court.
The tables are located in cozy areas.
There is no sense of crowding.
Well, we’ve been there, we’ve tried it...
The interior has nothing in common with a cozy Italian café...
There is very little space, and the tables are rectangular, like in a cafeteria.
Pizza… well, who hasn’t tried something tastier, so it seemed somewhat unremarkable to me.
It wasn’t very pleasant that the waiter was always standing behind you and was practically always looking your interlocutor in the face.
We were uncomfortable.
Connelly, yes, they are delicious.
We will not be coming back here and I will not be recommending it to my friends.
Lena Grosskopff is the best hairdresser I have ever been to.
She does everything very carefully and competently, I go to her with pleasure, and I know that everything will be done perfectly.
I only take my daughter to see Lena as well.
The atmosphere in the cabin is amazing.
Thank you so much!
We got a flat tire on the way with Nikita, and the kind people from KatResource quickly came to our aid!
Respect to you and prosperity, there should be more people like you!
And the server is clean and well-maintained!
They came to see Sergei Chigarkov perform.
It’s a great concert venue, with great sound and atmosphere.
We will definitely come to the scheduled concerts this year.
A peaceful location, a wonderful Georgian restaurant, on weekends and holidays live music is played!
The staff are nice and helpful!
There is a children's room.
Delicious Georgian cuisine!
The rating is the highest, I absolutely adore this place ❤
The park is in the city center, so it’s very easy to get to.
The park is clean, and there is something for both children and adults to do.
But there has long been no sand left in the children's playground, just dust.
There is also a fenced-in football field, which, unfortunately, is not very well-maintained.
But there are still more advantages in our park.
A spacious store, clean, with a clear layout of products.
There are products that can only be purchased at the Crossroads.
The staff are very welcoming.
I didn’t eat any bad products.
Often there are promotions and discounts.
It’s great that it’s close to home.
You can always find a parking spot.
I have been to this bar twice now and everything has been great - the staff are friendly, the food is delicious, and most importantly, the music is excellent and the DJs know what they are doing.
The only thing is that the lead singer of the group “Ruki Vverkh Band” is disappointing the second time around.
Not only does she sing, to put it mildly, not very well, but she also reads the lyrics off her phone during most of the songs, which was particularly striking when it came to the songs by the group "Руки вверх" (Ruki Vverh/Hands Up).
It just doesn't make sense somehow (performing at the Hand Up Bar, as part of the Hand Up Band).
We went on holiday at the beginning of March.
A good hotel with pleasant rooms.
They gave us a room with a view of the Kremlin for my birthday.
Room cleaning is done every day.
Refilling the water, tea, coffee, shampoo, and changing the towels.
The breakfasts were simply amazing.
There is a mini-bar with ridiculously high prices.
If you want to order room service from the restaurant, you will have to pay a 20% service charge on top of the bill.
The prices in the restaurant are slightly inflated.
It tastes like three and a half out of five.
The water park was included in the cost of accommodation.
The water park itself cannot be called the best in Russia.
As for the masseuse, she was simply amazing.
Everything was great, but the departure was a bit disappointing: no goodbyes or good roads.
The employee at the entrance didn’t even help open the door for the women carrying a bunch of bags and suitcases.
This is something that needs to be worked on in order to maintain our reputation.
A great place to hang out with friends and soak up the sun.
There is a large and comfortable sauna, billiards, an outdoor pool, and a karaoke room.
The food is delicious, and the drinks are fresh.)
A workshop of the highest level!
In a short amount of time, he has already repaired 3 pairs of shoes (2 men’s and 1 women’s).
Everything is fine.
Quality work at height.
Special thanks to the master for their careful approach and quality of work!
A wonderful basketball school!
The son is 5 months old and he absolutely loves it, he looks forward to every training session.
An individual approach to children, interesting activities, a warm and friendly atmosphere.
The store is great, the staff are helpful, and I order online myself.
The store is in a great location.
Plus, there are always discounts and promotions, which is also great.
A good AV store – convenient location, a large showroom, a good selection.
Special thanks to the staff for their helpfulness!
There are cafeterias with several tables.
I visit often and am always satisfied!
A good swimming pool!
Specifically regarding the "frogs", our coach Anastasia Vitalevna is very popular with the children and is very professional!
The locker rooms are clean, the water is warm, and there are hairdryers!
I love the pastry shop's croissants, the service is great, the croissants are excellent, and the breakfasts and coffee are always top-notch.
But alas, not this time, I ordered coffee and a couple of croissants, the girls at the cash register never made the coffee until I reminded them, it was undrinkable, it smelled bad and left a taste of spoiled milk, I decided not to finish it and just left.
Last time there was a long black hair in my coffee, so they replaced it.
Please be more careful, for I am a guest returning here, even after incidents like this.
Gorgeous eyebrows are what it’s all about!
Victoria makes excellent adjustments, taking into account all the individual proportions of the face.
Correction with warm wax, which effectively removes all the down, and the eyebrows look neat for a long time.
The color is selected based on the type of hair and skin, which ensures that the paint lasts a long time.
It’s better not to do anything to your eyebrows!
Thank you so much for organizing the move of my mother!
Moving is always a huge source of stress, but with your company everything went smoothly, quickly, and efficiently.
Special thanks to Vadim and Roman!
I will recommend your company to all my friends!
Everything is top-notch.
We have been treating our teeth as a family at NovoDent for a long time.
Recently, my 8-year-old son had his teeth treated, and everything went perfectly well. The child is calm and ready to come back.
You don’t have to wait long, and there are no queues because the appointments are made in advance.
In my opinion, the tastiest shawarma in Tambov can be found only here, I'm not a fan of shawarma, BUT when I want something unhealthy, this is the only place to go.
Tasty, fresh meat with lots of fillings.
And I don’t understand why, but it never flows out of me.
Often, when you finish the shawarma, you can’t eat any more because there’s so much sauce and water, in short, fufu…, but not here.
That’s why you guys are the best🙂
A good teaching staff.
The food in the cafeteria is always fresh.
Interesting classes at the school museum, various events are held throughout the school year
A pleasant store, friendly staff, a decent range of products.
However, the big downside is that the merchandise they bring in is apparently damaged right in the store.
Sometimes there is not much space to move between the rows, and it is also not very pleasant when the merchandise is just lying on the floor without any shelves, but this is more of a criticism of the organization rather than of a specific store.
A delightful example of Soviet architecture.
A strict grandeur, which is carefully maintained.
I had a double dose of enjoyment from the concert, largely thanks to the atmosphere at the cultural centre.
While we waited in the lobby for the event to begin, I distinctly felt that I had come to the event, that this was truly a coming out.
I was looking for a clutch kit for my MB Sprinter.
I ended up in this online auto parts store completely by chance.
I called, gave them my order number, and they told me to wait)
After 10 minutes, they called back and offered several options.
Since this was a personal vehicle, he didn’t skimp on expenses and asked to have a good set of LUK clutch components installed.
Another 5 minutes later, they called back and said that there was good news for you.
If you don’t go for the full package (tray + disc + crankshaft), but instead opt for the LUK package (tray + disc) and the separate LUK crankshaft, you’ll save 2 thousand rubles, which is not exactly something to be happy about.
After taking the clutch apart, I drove to the service center.
Upon examination of the gearbox, it was discovered that a flywheel was also needed, and the sooner the better.
I already knew where to go), the manager understood the situation and ordered without pre-payment over the phone (the first time I also paid for the order when I received it).
The following day, the crankshaft was in their hands.
The car is quite happy with the new crankshaft and clutch, I’m pleased that everything was delivered quickly and that they went out of their way to help.
I will definitely recommend vinkod.shop and use their services again.
The New Year’s party was a huge success, but with a few complications.
I booked a two-person table, but they ended up seating me at a four-person table.
But no big deal.
It’s just strange that no one warned us.
The food was average at best, and the fish was a complete failure.
The host is not very good with competitions made at the school level, to be honest.
BUT everything is perfect when it comes to the music.
The atmosphere was great.
Everything else seems like nitpicking.
Thank you for the event.
I am leaving this review with words of gratitude for all the staff of maternity hospital number 7 in Chelyabinsk.
Only people who know and love their work work at this institution, and the doctors and nurses are top-notch.
Both in the department of obstetrics and gynecology, the maternity ward, and the postpartum ward.
But I would especially like to express my gratitude to Kotlyarova E.Y., the head nurse of the maternity ward on the 5th floor, and to Yarantseva N.V., the obstetrician in the maternity ward, thank you so much for your help during the birth of my daughter, for your kind hearts and your exceptional professionalism.
A wonderful store.
A wide range of balloons, always fast order processing, and delivery.
Professional staff.
Very beautiful bouquets, always arranged with great taste and always featuring fresh flowers.
We visited this establishment on the recommendation of others.
The food is amazing, the entertainment is non-existent, the waitstaff are a bit brash, but we were in great company with children and celebrating an important event, so they were friendly.
There was no fire delivery, the children were waiting.
You can safely go there for good food.
