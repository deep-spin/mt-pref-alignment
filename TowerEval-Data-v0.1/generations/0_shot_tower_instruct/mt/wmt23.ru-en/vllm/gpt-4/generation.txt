The July issue is traditionally submitted during the Moscow Film Festival, and this is, of course, very sad: proofreading pages when your soul longs for Chabrol.
Nevertheless, we will talk about MIFF next time (for now, I will just complain that this year, the organizers have firmly established the inexplicable notion that the lucky holders of purchased tickets are far more important for the festival than accredited guests, a ridiculous and quite offensive principle that no normal film festival in the world would commit), and in this issue, we report on what we saw in Cannes and at "Kinotavr".
The July issue's cover is adorned by another pleasant face - the lead character of the movie "Predators," produced by Robert Rodriguez. Inside the magazine, try not to miss the story about Christopher Nolan's "Inception" (the man who, by the way, rebooted "Batman..."), the most - no kidding - anticipated film of the summer.
This time, we are publishing the first part of a rather detailed guide to the work of Alfred Hitchcock, and it is clear that there is no need to advertise anything special here. It is obvious to everyone that the authors of "Suspicion" and "Rope" are our own Tatyana Aleshicheva, Boris Gleyzerov, Anna Golovnya, Nick De Semlin, Dan Jolin, Tamara Dondurey, Nikolai Karaev, Denis Korsakov, Maria Kuvshinova, Ivan Kulikov, Will Lawrence, Sergey Mezenov, Sergey Natapov, Ian Nathan, Kim Newman, Zaira Ozova, Nev Pierce, Alexey Prostyakov, Serafima Skibyuk, Adam Smith, Moor Soboleva, Vasily Stepanov, Alexander Strelkov, Ollie Richards, Oleg Tishchenkov, Alena Logunova, Chris Hewitt, Olga Shakina and Londoner Evelyn Solt, who, despite her brilliant service record, was suspected of spying for the Russians and was determined to be caught at all costs.
Cornered, she will change into the familiar black and set off to seek the truth herself.
The upcoming action movie featuring Angelina Jolie as a fatal femme fatale promises to further solidify the actress's position in the action genre.
She will be causing one car accident after another, running on walls à la "Matrix", and tossing around sturdy men in identical strict suits like children.
This is roughly how beauty should save the world.
Here he is, the native, who exploded and repaired the world with "The Fifth Element" and made Milla Jovovich the most beautiful woman in the universe.
Bruce Willis was the most superhero-like guy, while Gary Oldman was the most stylish and flawless embodiment of Evil.
And yet, all together, it turned out not to be a boring American-style blockbuster about saving humanity, but rather a charming, lively carnival.
One does not wish to recall what Besson was doing for 13 years between "The Fifth Element..." and "Adèle...".
He, to put it mildly, was not idle, but all this script-producing fuss and rare, strained directorial performances will be forgotten.
But as for "Adele..." - hardly likely.
When you watch this movie, it seems like the Besson we knew 13 years ago was not our Besson, but some kind of double.
And he himself, the real one, lived in a small apartment in Montmartre, sipped wine in a cafe across the street, and composed a story about a most charming adventure seeker.
Retelling the plot (even in broad strokes), stirring up expectations, is more sinful than usual in this case.
Here, the incredible thrill lies in the fact that surprises await you at every turn or remark.
And all of them are pleasant.
Either a girl or a vision
THE EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURES OF ADEL
The most daring adventure film of the decade suggests that "The Extraordinary Adventures of Adèle" will start like "Amélie", veer towards "Jurassic Park", continue with "Indiana Jones" and "The Mummy", and end with "Titanic".
The film is based on the first volume of Jacques Tardi's comics about the journalist Adele Blanc-Sec.
Louise Bourgoin only appeared in three films before Adèle.
The actress gained fame for her role in "The Girl from Monaco", for which she was nominated for a César Award.
The director does not chase after the viewer with an outstretched hand, begging to appreciate the special effects, decorations, or tricks, but instead, like an old-fashioned novelist, he captivates, exclaiming before a great journey to the center of the earth or to the edge of the world: "Forward, my reader, great deeds await us!"
In doing so, Besson deals with genre cinema, about which he knows absolutely everything, in a cheeky and cheerful manner, like a boy who has watched a lot of old movies and read a lot of Jules Verne.
Manipulating banalities, not denying oneself cynicism and not being shy about taking risks
DIRECTOR Luc Besson
CAST: Louise Bourgoin, Mathieu Amalric, Frederic Bel, Gilles Lellouche
PLOT: Strange things were happening in Paris in 1912.
The city was thrown into panic by an ancient monster, awakened by an old medium.
The police, a famous hunter, a pair of scientists from the Museum of Natural History, and journalist Adèle Blanc-Sec are all chasing after the fossil creature. However, Adèle is not so much interested in the beast itself, but rather in a medium - she needs to save her sister.
With the same purpose, the girl brings a real mummy from Egypt.
RELEASES ON JULY 22
"Adèle..." is a case where parody becomes the pinnacle of the genre itself and is capable of radically changing it, directing it on a new path.
This was the case with Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, Quentin Tarantino's gangster action films, the aforementioned "Indiana Jones" (which was both paid homage to and mocked here), and finally, with "The Fifth Element" itself.
Besson's style in this film is composed of verbal trickery, acting clownery, and plot acrobatics (circus terms are quite appropriate - the unity of the two arts here is as organic and strong as ever).
A few words need to be said about Adel herself.
In her, the undeservedly forgotten type of adventuress is embodied, who takes not so much by exploiting sexuality, as by pure courage and bravery.
In movies, such girls are usually paired with some stereotypical macho man or a hairy romantic.
TEXT: ALEXANDER STRELKOV
Face to face with history
The only one available is a timid and comical sigher, who just keeps getting underfoot (only his knowledge in zoology turns out to be useful).
Therefore, the energetic girl does not waste time on romantic trifles, but happily spends time in the company of ancient corpses, which, by the way, play a key role in the plot.
Having honed his skills on numerous genre "cats" and seemingly completely jaded, Luc Besson showed unexpected creative audacity, reminding us that the boundary between the preferences of bored megamall visitors and highbrow regulars of art-house cinemas can easily be overcome with films for cheerful madmen.
Playing an adventure movie game without sorrow, fear, and reproach
DEATH ROOM
The hermetic horror with a claim to psychological depth and political context, Jonathan Liebesman's debut horror film in 2002, was panned by critics, but was liked by the audience and did well at the box office, and most importantly - caught the eye of producer Michael Bay.
Thus, the young director ended up at a factory that churns out new horrors based on old templates: Bay set out to remake all the classic horror films and entrusted Liebesman with the prequel to "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (2006).
The critic grimaced again, but the audience liked it again - Liebesman worked in the spirit of the "new horrors", emphasizing the excessive physicality of violence.
In general, his example allows us to observe how an entire genre is convulsing, trying to invent new ways to impact the saturated audience: the naturalistic gore of splatter films merges with the chase scenes of slashers.
The plot is reminiscent of the "Saw" franchise, but without liters of blood.
Among the prototypes is the debut film "Cube" by Vincenzo Natali. The film was not made by Michael Bay.
So in "The Death Room," Liebesman was forced to take a different path: instead of a mindless massacre or monotonous running from a maniac, he preferred a smarter option - almost without the infamous bloodshed, but with psychological gameplay and puzzles.
Evil doctors here play cat and mouse with the test subjects.
And three men in a locked room are trying to develop a survival strategy: unite as a team or shoot each other?
Play by the rules and obey orders from the outside?
Or try to break your cage at any cost?
Not only do they undergo the check, but also a young ambitious special services employee, who is tested for ruthlessness by an experienced professor seasoned in wild experiments.
PLOT: For 250 dollars, four volunteers sign up for a simple test.
They are placed in an isolated room and each is given a stack of papers with meaningless questions.
Then a polite man in a white coat enters the room, introduces himself as a doctor, and shoots one of the subjects in the head.
The survival game begins, closely watched by government agents behind the glass.
Too thoughtful for a horror movie, but not enough for a blatant art house.
Can carry on a worldly conversation, and hit someone in the face with a fire extinguisher, but is incapable of ignoring a single skirt.
Charming Nastya, on the contrary, is cautious and unwavering in her sympathies.
She is hurt by her father's courteous lifestyle and openly spies on him as he, seemingly parodying the famous scene from Paul Verhoeven's "Showgirls," dives into the pool for another romantic victim.
The daughter is rebelling, and the father is tempting her young suitor from a poor family with money.
But the main theme of the family conflict is not at all the generation gap or the choice of profession, which is, one way or another, already predetermined, but the girl's unsuccessful attempts to refute the obvious idea that everything in modern Moscow can be bought and sold.
Mger Mkrtchan and Pavel Bardiny, known for their lackluster melodramatic style, directed a comedy with Ivan Urgant titled "Three and a Snowflake".
Depardieu convincingly portrayed the father of a growing daughter in the genre of comedy.
The fragmented plot revolves around the romantic adventures of the characters, who constantly discuss psychology, but themselves, apparently due to a clever directorial decision, focus on the language of gaze and gesture.
Secondary plot branches (a girl mutilated in a car accident whom Alexey wants to marry, an alcoholic athlete played by Sergey Gorobchenko), alas, are only sketchily outlined.
It's particularly regrettable about the line regarding the business of buying and selling football players, which remained off-screen.
PLOT: What worries the football star sales agent most in the world is the fate of his underage daughter Nastya.
The compassionate father himself changes women like expensive shirts, but his daughter is about to turn eighteen, and she absolutely must marry a guy "with a backbone".
Imagine the businessman's disappointment when Nastya, in her fight for independence and to spite her father, chooses his peer and business partner.
However, the author hit the bull's eye with the potential slogan for the film's audience: "Don't look for a problem where there isn't one." You couldn't say it any better.
Their similarity simply cannot fail to impress.
In both films, squads of tough guys, mercenaries, are forced to take revenge on those who set them up, and in each group, there happens to be one beautiful girl.
The heroes jump around practically the same parts of the world (both films start in Latin America and end in the port of Los Angeles) and exploit the same spectacular shots - in both places something stuffed with dollar bills explodes, and a whirlwind of bucks descends on the set.
Even villains dressed in expensive suits are not easy to distinguish from each other (in both cases they are played by Patricks - Jason Patrick here, Patrick Wilson there).
Zoe Saldana's previous role was Neytiri in "Avatar".
Sylvain White previously filmed about dance battles - "Stomp the Yard".
Chris Evans was recently invited to play the hero of other comics: he will be Captain America.
Director Sylvain White was inspired by a series of comics that were released in the 70s and were relaunched in the 2000s, while Joe Carnahan was inspired by a comedy series from the 80s.
It's simply amazing how they, without any collusion, brought different material to an absolutely identical thunderous denominator, creating rather heavy, predictable, unnecessary action films, evoking a multitude of images with Willis and Schwarzenegger (comparisons invariably turn out in favor of Bruce and Arnold).
If you have to choose between these two films, "Losers" looks a bit more appealing and clearly more successful in terms of efficiency (after all, the budget is three and a half times smaller).
At least, here we have Zoe Saldana, who really suits a bazooka.
CAST: Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Zoe Saldana, Chris Evans, Patrick Wilson, Idris Elba, Columbus Short
PLOT: During an operation in the Bolivian jungle, a group of seasoned commandos working for the CIA were betrayed by their own superiors: the helicopter with children they were trying to save was blown up, and the soldiers themselves have been considered dead since that moment.
But they are alive - and are determined to take revenge at all costs on the scoundrel with the languid voice, who orchestrated all of this.
All of this is nice, but honestly, spending an hour and a half of your life on a Wyeth painting is worth it only if you have absolutely no more interesting options.
Made from recycled materials, a conditionally edible action figure
A simple story about a runaway Romanian convict
In the Romanian low-budget film, which received an award at a prestigious international film festival.
In principle, having only this data at hand, one can vividly imagine both the hypothetical content of the picture and even some specific details of the form.
Without a doubt, the film promises to be socially acute.
Undoubtedly, it will be realistic, moreover, harsh.
There is a high probability of non-professional actors participating.
The film will also feature a lot of Romanian poverty (yes, poverty knows no nationality, but Romanian, as proven by our festival laureates from film to film, is particularly poor).
Also, without knowing the year of release, one could easily mistake what's happening on the screen for exercises by some underground critical realists from the Warsaw Pact countries, who were lectured about Bresson in the early 80s.
The film received the Grand Jury Prize at the Berlin International Film Festival.
The script is based on a play by Andreea Valean, whose work is particularly in demand among directors of the Romanian "new wave".
Operator Marius Panduru often works with Corneliu Porumboiu.
Everything said is true both for Florin Serban's debut work, and - understand us correctly - carries not a derogatory, but a commendatory nature: the Romanian "new wave" is in that blissful stage of development, when its representatives have faith in their methods.
She has not yet doubted her work.
And this moment must be seized: only thanks to this belief can one endure a ninety-minute spectacle of a Romanian juvenile colony and surrender to the charisma of the most talented Pisteranu (whose story, despite the abyss separating the two cultures, can be easily understood).
Convert it into a 70s-style exploitation film, featuring a cowboy who decides to take a stroll from jail, where he is about to be released, to the nearest saloon.
CAST: Georg Pistereanu, Ada Condeescu, Mihai Constantin, Clara Voda, Marian Bratu
PLOT: After serving his four-year sentence, 18-year-old convict Silviu (Pisteranu) is soon to be released, but unexpectedly finds out that his mother wants to take his younger brother with her to Italy.
From this moment on, the young man's behavior becomes inappropriate.
The intrigue with Anna's social worker further prompts the guy to take desperate actions, the meaning of which is exhausted by the title of the picture.
What nonsense this all is!
If you want to watch - watch.
A decent debut, inspiring faint hope that a respectable trend will someday emerge from Romanian art house.
Cartoon about the joys of villainy and family life
The directorial debut of a man named Grob (Sop) and his co-author Reno was made under the auspices of producer Christopher Meledandri, the grey cardinal of American animation, responsible, among other things, for all the "Ice Ages", "Horton" and "Robots".
"Despicable Me" is probably the best work of his team: the picture is beautifully drawn (by the way, it makes sense to watch it in 3D), especially if you love when various objects constantly try to jump out of the screen into the hall), decently written, and most importantly, there is not a single below-the-belt joke, because of which during the "Ice Ages" one had to shamefully sink into the chair and cover children's ears with hands.
It is clear that the reason for the change of course was not the authors' sense of proportion, but the glaring asexuality of the main character, which in turn was dictated by the reluctance to touch on the topic of pedophilia in any way.
The "adult" part here, in addition to the main conflict of single fatherhood, is represented by quite harsh black humor (which, one would like to think, we owe to director Coffin).
Overall, this is a very charming film - so much so that at some point it even seems too perfect and correct.
One can sense the meticulous work of a well-coordinated marketing team, who thought through every detail to ensure the film appeals to all categories of citizens.
Not that we want to see the characters of a children's cartoon being eaten by cannibals or destroyed by a nuclear explosion.
PLOT: The big-nosed villain Gru, whose childhood dreams of becoming an astronaut over the years transformed into the idea of stealing the Moon, is forced to enlist the help of children to carry out his grand plan and eliminate a young competitor.
In a certain advanced orphanage, he adopts three female orphans - Margo in glasses, Edith in a hat, and Agnes, whose degree of cuteness can only be compared to the kitten from "Shrek".
As it usually happens, children immediately transform the plans of adults.
The main character is modeled after Christopher Meledandri - both of them are bald, have prominent noses, and are prone to dark humor.
In the original, the main characters were voiced by Steve Carell and Jason Segel.
In the finale, Gru dances Travolta's part.
A car rolls up to an abandoned trailer somewhere in the middle of a hypothetical desert, from which three pairs of substantial breasts emerge.
Exactly so.
The bearers of this gift themselves are not so significant.
The camera confidently focuses attention on this part of the body.
For connoisseurs, we immediately share good news - the entire film is made in the same spirit.
Rick Jacobson understands the most important aspects of female beauty and conducted a casting in such a way that what happens on screen is of secondary importance.
And a lot of funny things happen.
A "broker", a "killer", and a "stripper" are digging in the sand, dousing themselves with water (don't ask why), spouting some nonsense, and periodically getting into fierce fights.
The creators believe that a swearing cow with generous curves, covered in mud, with a broken nose and shining white teeth, is cool.
"Naughty little things" are primarily oriented towards classic sexploitation films.
Rick Jacobson directed episodes of "Xena: Warrior Princess" and "The Incredible Journeys of Hercules".
A film close in spirit in Moscow's distribution is "A Gun for Jennifer".
It's also cool when a bitchy beauty twists a bandit's balls, a crazy punk fights alongside a Japanese schoolgirl, complete with a samurai sword and lesbian sex; and the intrigue unfolds through an endless number of flashbacks.
In general, a real Klondike of pleasures is discovered here for a cinema fetishist.
It's clear, of course, that Jacobson and his gang had a blast making this trash-parody, but the task itself seems quite strange.
If it weren't for the actresses' physical attributes, it would have become boring by the middle.
It can be assumed that this wild stuff came to us from the adult night channel (Jacobson, by the way, often takes on serial episodes).
CAST: Julia Voth, Erin Cummings, America Olivo, Michael Hurst, Ron Melendez
PLOT: Three dangerous beauties bring a mafia boss to the desert, where he has hidden diamonds worth a substantial amount somewhere.
Having achieved nothing and having shot the unfortunate bandit, the women start to squabble, fight with each other and periodically with thugs appearing from somewhere, as well as regularly kissing and cuddling.
As things progress, it turns out that all three are not who they appeared to be at the beginning.
Apparently, in the author's opinion, this is even more amusing.
A product for a narrow circle of connoisseurs of monstrous bad taste
Yes, with his latest film "Judgment Day," a ragged "Mad Max" for the poor, Marshall made a serious blunder.
The bloodthirsty and biting peplum restores the shaken trust in the director.
The new politically incorrect and gloomy magnum opus is not shy of a modest budget, obvious sources of inspiration, and fierce B-category film aesthetics.
The painting features both the hooligan bravado of the "War Dogs" and the beastly cruelty of the "Descent".
The "Marshall Plan" for cleaning up the "peplum" from the stuck post-gladiatorial film dirt, overall, worked.
In 2011, Kevin MacDonald will present his interpretation of the history of the Ninth Legion.
His legionnaires, covered in battle scars (among others, unexpectedly colorful David Morrissey and Liam Cunningham) - are tough guys, trying to reconcile their warrior duty with the overwhelming desire to survive.
Suicide and the spicy details of attending to natural needs in ancient times are depicted here with affection and thoroughness.
The scene of the Ninth Legion's extermination, which consumed a significant portion of the budget, was directly inspired by the introductory battle in the German forests from the now iconic "Gladiator" by Sir Ridley Scott. However, there is no desire to accuse Marshall of plagiarism: he works honestly and without pretension.
CAST: Michael Fassbender, Olga Kurylenko, Dominic West, Liam Cunningham, David Morrissey
PLOT: The lands of modern Scotland, occupied by the Holy Roman Empire.
The remote outpost, where Centurion Quintus Dias (Fassbender) is stationed, is ruthlessly destroyed by a Pictish reconnaissance unit.
Miraculously surviving, Dias is first forced to join the notoriously infamous Ninth Legion, and then, with a handful of other surviving Romans, tries to slip away from a group of Pictish militants led by the sadistic Etain (Kurylenko).
So far, the subtle art-house actor has only managed to secure sharply characterized supporting roles in Hollywood, but there is a strong hope that the situation will change after "Centurion".
Peplum - revised and expanded edition.
Almost like "Gladiator," only humbler and harsher.
The continuation of the story about schoolgirl Bella (Kristen Stewart) and her complicated relationships with two extremely promising young men - the pale-faced vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and the werewolf-bodybuilder Jacob (Taylor Lautner).
Pattinson's fans held their breath.
A large-scale film adaptation of the animated series about a bald boy-wizard, destined to bring peace to four kingdoms.
The Fire Lord instigated a bloody war and subjugated his neighbors.
Young Aang will be able to stop him only if he learns to control all the elements and becomes the Avatar.
Cobb's house (Leonardo DiCaprio) is capable of stealing other people's thoughts and tirelessly works in the field of industrial espionage.
Penetrating into the object's sleep, he makes the sleeping brain work according to his rules.
But this time he has to do the opposite - leave in one head what was not there.
A picturesque lesson on managing illusory worlds from Christopher Nolan.
An experienced wizard (Nicolas Cage) finds himself a young assistant in hopes of defeating the evil sorcerer (Alfred Molina) together.
Using destructive spells, they will create chaos with dragons and explosions in the middle of Manhattan.
Bald as a billiard ball, the kitty has planned to take over the entire world, and now the super-agent dogs are forced to join forces with their meowing antagonists.
The second episode of the fluffy family comedy.
Several hardened cutthroats, led by the seemingly frail Royce (Adrien Brody), mysteriously find themselves on another planet, where stylish, fanged aliens hunt them for sport.
The return of the cult character from the 80s to the big screen.
Pay attention to George Clooney, who teamed up with rock-photographer-turned-director Anton Corbijn ("Control") for a rather intriguing existential exploration of the psychology of an aging hitman, hiding from people in a small Italian town and belatedly understanding human nature.
"A visionary artist of Cobain's scale and the magnificent George Clooney - this is a cinematic union made in heaven," boasts the studio press release.
In addition, this project is yet another confirmation of Clooney's longest love affair in life - with Italy: the filming took place in the picturesque town of Castel del Monte in Abruzzo.
Based on Martin Booth's novel "A Very Private Gentleman," Rowan Joffe made some adjustments to his script: the role of the English narrator was replaced by the American mentioned in the title, and the main character transformed from an illegal arms dealer to a simple murderer.
Otherwise, the story is close to the original: while the killer Jack is trying to sort out his last case and finally quit his lucrative trade, his icy heart melts under the charm of a local priest (Paolo Bonacelli) and a street prostitute (Thekla Reuten), whom Clooney's character instantly falls in love with.
"Jack is tempting fate," states the official synopsis.
The dangerous messenger of darkness is getting closer and closer to him, and the mysterious lady who hires him could very well turn out to be not who she claims to be.
Judging by the trailer, Corbain's visual experiments, spiced up with Clooney's ash-colored hair (the film looks like a long clip 02), have reached a qualitatively new level.
Daniel Radcliffe will play the lead role in the film adaptation of Remarque's "All Quiet on the Western Front".
Can I snap a picture of you with my camera!?
This season, Johnny Depp could be seen in two places at once.
Firstly, on the filming location of the thriller "The Tourist" in Venice, directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck (known for "The Lives of Others").
There he plays a tourist in love with Angelina Jolie's character.
Secondly, in Puerto Rico on the set of "The Rum Diary," the film adaptation of the debut novel by the legendary Hunter S. Thompson.
The director and screenwriter of the project is Bruce Robinson ("Withnail and I"), whose latest directorial work was the thriller "Jennifer 8" in 1992.
Looking at the work of poster artists of the domestic prison drama, one can be certain that they were inspired.
But one should not approach the issue of implementing an idea literally!
However, it's good at least that the heroine of the Russian film, although a stranger, is not bald at all.
Director Dennis Dugan primarily specializes in projects with Adam Sandler.
They already have four joint projects to their credit: "Happy Gilmore", "Big Daddy", "Chuck and Larry: Fire Wedding", "Don't Mess with the Zohan!"
In July, the fifth comedy "Classmates" is being released, and the sixth one - "The Pretend Wife" with Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman is in the works.
The schedule also includes a seventh film - a romantic comedy "Jack and Jill", where Sandler is set to play both Jack and his twin sister Jill.
Matthew Vaughn, who made a splash this year with the spectacular action film "Kick-Ass," will take on the reboot of X-Men.
For the film "X-Men: First Class," the director first invited James McAvoy, offering him the role of the young Professor X.
Rosamund Pike will play the telepathic mutant Emma Frost, also known as the White Queen, Amber Heard will transform into the blue-skinned Mystique, and Michael Fassbender is expected to become Magneto.
While the filming of the new James Bond series is being postponed, its new director Sam Mendes doesn't have time to get bored.
His list of works includes the musical "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" and the adaptation of Iain McEwan's novel "On Chesil Beach".
The author himself adapts the script.
Carey Mulligan has been offered the lead female role.
Gary Oldman is considering the role of pragmatic Major George Smiley - the main character of John le Carré's novel series - in the film adaptation of the thriller "Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy".
Alec Guinness starred in the first adaptation of this work in 1979.
The new version will be directed by Danish director Tomas Alfredson, creator of the horror film "Let the Right One In".
Tom Tykwer is adapting David Mitchell's bestselling science fiction novel "Cloud Atlas."
According to the director, it's a challenging task (the novel has six parallel plot lines), but extremely interesting work.
He has already made offers to Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, James McAvoy, Ian McKellen, and Natalie Portman.
Filming of Maxim Korostyshevsky's international action movie, working title "Soldiers of Fortune," is taking place in Crimea.
It is dedicated to millionaires who went to war for their money in search of adrenaline.
The cast includes Christian Slater, Sean Bean, Ving Rhames, Dominic Monaghan, Oksana Korostyshevskaya, and others.
The premiere of the film is scheduled for the beginning of 2011.
Sam Rockwell will star in the comedy "Baby Jesus" alongside English pop star Pixie Lott.
Megan Fox was fired from "Transformers 3"
As assured by the film company Ragatoipe, the dismissal "is not related to that interview in which Fox compared Michael Bay to Hitler".
Nevertheless, the role of the main heroine and the new love interest of the hero Shia LaBeouf will most likely be played by the English model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.
The girl has no experience in cinema, so she is facing an accelerated acting course.
This fact should not scare the seasoned viewer - in the history of cinema, there are plenty of examples of successful retraining of models into actresses.
Charlize Theron ("Monster"), Angelina Jolie ("Interrupted Life"), Jessica Lange ("Blue Sky", "Tootsie"), Kim Basinger ("L.A. Confidential"), Jennifer Connelly ("A Beautiful Mind"), Geena Davis ("The Accidental Tourist") and "First Runner-Up Miss USA-86" Halle Berry ("Monster's Ball") all started as models or appeared in fashion magazines, and eventually earned a well-deserved "Oscar".
They have excelled in acting skills (also beauties Milla Jovovich, Cameron Diaz, Monica Bellucci and, especially pleasing, our compatriot Olga Kurylenko.
High rewards are clearly within their reach.
In other words, Rosie has someone to look up to.
Valeriya Gai Germanika, who earned a Special Mention from the Cannes jury in 2008 for her film "Everybody Dies But Me" and directed the controversial TV series "School", has been appointed as the creative director at the MT TV channel.
The channel's management believes that it is Valeria who will be able to bring about the desired and necessary changes.
In particular, plans are already underway for filming their own series (about teenagers or about vampires).
Also, Germanika began casting for new hosts.
The comedy "Kolotilov" directed by Leo Gabriadze and produced by Timur Bekmambetov unexpectedly turned into "Twists and Turns".
The main theme of the film remains the same - a provincial Russian language teacher, Slava Kolotilov (Konstantin Khabensky), rushes to Moscow to his bride, but is delayed to coach a football team of homeless children.
The second plot line of the film has received a new development.
Instead of actress Elena Plaksina, the role of the metropolitan bride Nadya will be played by Milla Jovovich.
As an additional intrigue, a third character will appear - Nadya's former fiancé Danya (Ivan Urgant).
Thus, in addition to the question of whether the courtyard team will win the football championship, there arises the dilemma of who will get Milla Jovovich.
Due to constant delays in filming "The Hobbit" and the presence of numerous side projects, Guillermo del Toro declined the position of director.
Studios are persuading producer Peter Jackson to take full control of the matter, but he is only willing to take this step in case of dire necessity.
David Yates, who finished filming the Harry Potter saga, and Neill Blomkamp, whose film "District 9", produced by Jackson, received an Oscar nomination, are named as possible successors.
The name of the new director will officially be announced at the next Sots-Sop convention at the end of July.
Angelina Jolie will play Cleopatra
Driven mad by the hectic schedule, critics and cinematographers rushed back and forth at high speed between the Sochi Winter Theater, where screenings and master classes were held, and the "Pearl" hotel, where press conferences and round tables were held non-stop, barely having time to take a dip in the Black Sea.
The heroes of the competition films also behaved accordingly - in almost every one, someone was running somewhere: bewildered Asians from Yusup Razykov's "Gastarbeiter" and Dmitry Mamuliya's "Another Sky" were looking for a missing grandson and wife, a fugitive bandit from Yuri Bykov's film "To Live".
The same cops were happily fooled by the hero of Klim Shipenko's detective story "Who am I?" - who, however, was remembered by the audience more for the presence of a completely naked Zhanna Friske in the frame.
Heroes of the domestic show business have appeared and also in a couple of competitive films - in the movie "Elephant", Sergey Shnurov played a long-haul trucker transporting a circus animal for slaughter, and Evgeny Grishkovets pondered on his favorite topics - female betrayal, male loneliness, the healing power of alcohol - in the two-person film production "Satisfaction", where business partners challenged each other to a drinking duel over a lady.
However, even the business events at "Kinotavr" had a noticeable touch of show - there was not a single boring one.
At a round table dedicated to the fate of Russian art house cinema, a colorful argument with critics was initiated by Sergey Tolstikov, the chairman of the fund for supporting domestic cinema: "Do you even read the articles in the press that I read?" he sternly asked those gathered.
"I write them," the bewildered president of ERVEZS, Andrey Plakhov, replied.
The scandals did not end there: closer to the end of the festival, Alexey Fedorchenko's film "Ovsyanki" was suddenly removed from the competition program - it will go to Venice: the selectors of the Mostra decided that an extra Russian screening would be a hindrance.
Previously, "Kinotavr" did not interfere with the giants - films from major festivals were shown in Sochi more than once: this time, for example, Sergey Loznitsa's film "My Joy" participated in the competition, competing with Mikhalkov and Weerasethakul on the Azure Coast in the spring.
Nikita Sergeyevich attended the "Kinotavr" film of his former Cannes competitor and stated that he liked it.
The jury chairman, Karen Shakhnazarov, on the contrary, did not like Loznitsa's film at all - but under pressure from his colleagues, he was forced to award it a prize for direction.
The award for the best debut - "Missing in Action" - was received by the daughter.
A terrifying film encyclopedia of Russian life: the naive, humane, and rational hero is beaten, robbed, and provoked into monstrous actions without any apparent purpose.
A precisely made, purifying experimental film, shot by a misanthrope with a mathematical education, which calls for only one thing - start thinking.
A debutant with a philosophical education, Mamuliya refers to films as quotes from Mamardashvili, avoids any events in the script, and asserts that the viewer's joy lies in the effort to comprehend his scarcely accessible meditative films.
The most complex picture of "Kinotavr" has already been selected for the Karlovy Vary competition - a directorial star is born.
Impeccably dressed and groomed, the programmer Leonid reacts to the world with restrained disdain, hiding in the burrow of his neat bachelor life.
But an iron woman descends upon the house, an unjust hand of punitive authorities falls on the hero's head, and he begins a senseless run through Kafkaesque spaces and situations.
"Sometimes it's beneficial to work not only with newcomers," triumphantly announced producer Sabina Eremeeva from the stage, accepting the award.
Critics thought otherwise: in their opinion, Sabine simply managed to bring out the "inner debutant" from the leading figure of domestic art cinema.
And this is symptomatic - nowadays in our cinema, the old guard is following the youth.
And not the other way around.
Documentary cinema, shot in such a way that it blows your mind more than any similar feature film.
The author is interested in both a screwdriver examining an electric meter, and a piece of unsalted butter drifting across a cast-iron pan - all of this transforms the story of an unemployed miner, his sparsely-toothed beloved, and her criminal brother into a true oil-on-canvas documentary.
The winner of the short film competition, Nikolai Sokolov, applies the black-and-white aesthetics of the French New Wave to the world of residential districts.
Let Godarov's editing techniques in the story about two schoolboys, one of whom dreams of making a bomb, and the other - of playing Bach backwards, seem strange, but thanks for the rare attempt to poeticize the surrounding reality.
"Three times a year - on the eve of Victory Day, Russia Day, and City Day - about ten aircraft of the types An-12, Il-18, An-32, An-24, equipped with meteorological equipment and technical means for cloud seeding, and loaded with special environmentally friendly chemical substances - liquid nitrogen, granulated carbon dioxide ("dry ice"), meteorological pyrotechnics with silver iodide, and powdered reagents, are launched into the sky."
The process looks as follows: airplanes at a distance of 50-100 kilometers from Moscow (depending on the length and power of the rain front) "break up" the clouds heading towards the city with these reagents. Particles of substances condense moisture around themselves.
As a result, precipitation occurs earlier than planned, specifically in the place where the cloud was affected.
Work has been underway for about ten years on a remake of a science fiction film in which Michael York played the lead role.
Recently, Carl Rinsch was appointed as the director, who is already scheduled to remake "Creature from the Black Lagoon", and is famous for his advertising clips.
Previously, the names associated with the project were Bryan Singer ("X-Men"), James McTeigue ("V for Vendetta") and Joseph Kosinski ("Tron: Legacy").
According to the plot, the protagonist, who has turned thirty, is forced to flee from a death sentence, as the society of the future executes all citizens upon reaching this age.
Robert Rodriguez has acquired the rights to the rotoscopic fantasy cartoon of the 80s and plans to turn it into a large-scale film.
The original was the result of a collaborative effort between director Ralph Bakshi (animated film "The Lord of the Rings", 1976) and fantasy artist Frank Frazetta.
The theme of the cartoon was swords, magic, and a large number of drawn breasts.
In it, the warrior Larn saves Princess Tigra and the entire people from the evil ice ruler Nekron.
Rodriguez promises to pay careful attention to the creation of inhumans and barbarians on pterodactyls.
George A. Romero will send his zombies on vacation for the near future, as he himself plans to work on a remake of Dario Argento's classic giallo film.
The heroes will be brought back to the big screens by none other than Michael Bay - the master of action, explosions, and horror remakes.
The remake will be directed by Damin Chen, who will also adapt the screenplay.
Argento and Romero had already collaborated on "Day of the Dead" and together they filmed "Two Evil Eyes" in 1990.
This time, Dario is not directly involved in the project, but his brother Claudio is producing the film and writing the script for it.
Jennifer Garner and Nick Nolte will join Russell Brand and Helen Mirren in the remake of the comedy "Arthur".
"I wanted to infuse more strength into the female character to reflect the state of affairs in China," says Chen.
- Chinese women in our time run large businesses and win Olympic gold.
Gon Li embodies this power.
For the second time in a row, you are playing an imaginary character.
Is this a coincidence?
Regular pattern.
I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I am representing two films here (at the "Kinotavr" and Sochi film market - EMRBE).
And in both, I play the dream woman.
But... that's how the director saw me, that's how he presented me, and many people probably think that's how I am in real life.
Dream girl.
Your film partner Alexander Yatsenko looks nothing like his character.
How did you find common ground? What is he like on set?
He is absolutely not what he seems at first glance.
First, I saw him and thought: "Yes... this won't be easy for me".
Probably, without human contact, sincere and genuine, we would not have achieved anything.
And this contact happened literally a few minutes after we met.
We have, I'm not afraid to say, become great friends.
I told him about all my fears, all my worries, about how I was afraid that I wouldn't succeed, and asked him for some advice and help, and he gladly gave me that advice and help.
We talked a lot...
I tried to do this because I was very afraid of losing this contact, of losing our mutual understanding.
And that's why at the premiere we watched the entire movie holding hands.
How did the filming in Sevastopol go?
Sevastopol is the city where I arrived for the first time.
I have never been there on tour, nor for vacation, nor did I visit there in my childhood.
This city possesses a special magic, its own character, its own charisma.
And this is a city you want to return to.
He has his own provincial charm.
A place where no one is in a hurry and always manages to get everywhere on time.
So, it wasn't difficult for you to pretend to be in love with this city.
Generally, you are extremely natural on screen, which, frankly, many did not expect.
How do you work with roles?
Do you find emotional scenes easy to handle?
You know, I am an amateur actor.
And I am, by nature, a very trusting person.
If I came and agreed to work with the director, then I essentially entrust myself into his hands and I want to be the dough that will be shaped.
I perfectly understand that things are clearer from the outside, and again, I ask for hints and talk to the director for a very long time. In fact, it's not even me talking to him, but he is the one having preliminary discussions with me and explains very clearly and precisely what he needs.
And then, through long, hours-long rehearsals, we arrive at that organic quality you're talking about.
And how was your experience working with the film director Klim Shipenko?
I was thrilled with everyone, the operator, the director, the producer, Sasha Yatsenko.
Because I enjoy working with crazy people so much!
I saw the same thing when I was working with Timur Bekmambetov.
He was ready not to sleep, not to eat - and this was exactly such a situation.
Not to sleep, not to eat for days - and still, whether thunder or hail.
And if something didn't work out - it was a disaster, and something urgently needed to be done to make it work.
In this atmosphere of madness, it's very easy to work.
And it seems to me that when people are so driven to the point of painful fanaticism in what they do, it cannot but succeed, because too much energy is expended.
What scenarios are you rejecting?
What are the criteria for selecting the material you will be working with?
I don't want nonsense, stupid dialogues, movies that say nothing, carry nothing.
I don't want to work just for the sake of appearing on screen one more time.
Do you have any proposals or projects that you plan to work on in the near future?
There are no specific proposals and plans at the moment.
I am not the person who schedules charts.
The script arrived, it piqued my interest, and today this premiere took place.

While we are working on the November issue, film festivals are practically non-stop in Moscow: the American film festival - "Amfest", "2togo\", the “2-t-1” will start soon, followed by the British film festival.
And here's what's interesting: half of my acquaintances are constantly discussing who needs to be boycotted and who needs to be supported, based on some - well, excuse me - very vague reasons.
Meanwhile, when one of these festivals is solemnly closed with a terrifying Chu4 projection without English subtitles, it seems like no one notices anything.
The last thing one wants to do is grumble about this, but if you, having bought a ticket, stay in the hall to watch gigantic pixels and horizontal figures of actors, then that's exactly what they will continue to show you.
Meanwhile, in our issue, there are no pixels: "Tron: Legacy" (a sequel to the classic film about virtual reality), "Let Me In. Saga" (an American remake of a wonderful Swedish film), "Unstoppable" (another Tony Scott's approach to the theme of trains), and a wildly detailed story about how the Conan films were made, about the barbarian, destroyer, and governor.

The multi-episode fairy tale about a charming little wizard is nearing its conclusion.
And even though fans of the series have long since read the book and know how it all ends, and those to whom the word "Expelliarmus" means nothing will stay at home, the title of the main blockbuster of November is essentially reserved for Harry.
By the way, the studios are not run by fools either: in order to prolong the viewer's pleasure and ultimately squeeze the most out of the franchise, they decided to split the seventh film into two parts.
So, the sentimental farewell to the magical world of Hogwarts will extend until next summer.
SOCIAL NETWORK
The history of the creation of Facebook network
David Fincher's new film is, first and foremost, a story about a paradox.
The film tells the story of the invention of Facebook, one of the pioneering tools in the internet sphere, which united the whole world, caused a rift between five friends, and made its creator - 26-year-old former Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg - the youngest billionaire of the last decades.
Jesse Eisenberg in the lead role is just as magnificent as our conflicted genius, an emotionally isolated social outcast with an unpredictable set of motivations and attachments.
Zuckerberg is launching a website for a variety of reasons: partly out of resentment towards the world around him, partly out of competitive interest, and partly just because IT is "cool".
The very idea and its implementation may seem impulsive and spontaneous, but the actual course of events suggests a clear calculation and a well-thought-out business plan.
The strengths of "The Social Network" become apparent from the first frames, especially in the scene before the opening credits, where Zuckerberg is talking in a bar with his soon-to-be ex-girlfriend Erica (Mara): the sharp, hard-hitting dialogues of screenwriter Aaron Sorkin gain momentum here and do not soften until the very end.
The same goes for Fincher's direction: relatively restrained (with the exception of the Winklevoss twins played by actors who don't resemble each other.
The face of one of them was superimposed onto the other using computer graphics.
Natalie Portman studied at Harvard at the same time as Zuckerberg.
Rooney Mara landed the lead role in Fincher's next film "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo".
DIRECTOR David Fincher
CAST: Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Rooney Mara, Justin Timberlake, Armie Hammer, Joshua Pence
PLOT: A gloomy and introverted Harvard student, Mark Zuckerberg, after facing a setback on the personal front, takes on the ambitious task of creating a fundamentally new social network.
As Facebook's popularity grows, relationships with a few companion friends start to break down and ultimately lead to lawsuits.
The color palette plays its role: warm, sunny in places, remaining cozy even in the darkness, it maneuvers between two tangled chains of events and two separate legal disputes.
Beyond the stream of incessant discussions in the film, not much happens: not a single death, not a single murder, and all of Zuckerberg's legal troubles hardly amount to even an additional paragraph for his sparse Wikipedia page.
What then attracted the 49-year-old Sorkin and the 48-year-old Fincher to this story, which is not particularly rich in details?
After viewing, there is a persistent feeling that "The Social Network" is a portrait of our time, and the understatement in this case is an important artistic technique.
Just about twenty years ago, "Wall Street" was doing roughly the same thing, only on a larger scale - with cosmic egos and big deals.
Now, when the daily solvency has become even higher, politics is no longer conducted at board meetings, but in sandboxes.
Zuckerberg wants to be special, he dreams of becoming the center of attention.
Severin (Garfield) is hurt that his best friend has a new best friend (Timberlake) and now he has no one to play with.
The Winklevosses (Hammer and Pence), meanwhile, are stomping their feet: who said that the rich, beautiful, and athletic can't also be smart?
(This line particularly amuses Fincher.)
If desired, "The Social Network" could easily have been turned into a black comedy.
Zuckerberg is obsessed with the idea of popularity and leadership, but what is more in his case - positive or negative?
And what social consequences will his invention entail?
Is he a con artist?
Or a cunning manipulator?
Fincher and Sorkin will never close the book if there is even the slightest hint of something like that in it.
But it won't even be necessary here: in their version of the story, it doesn't matter at all.
"What's it like to feel beautiful?" - is asked in the song by Tre WeaNes "VaBu Uoc'te A Vsp Map", preceding the titles.
The hero does not know.
The film suggests the answer.
Zuckerberg is a representative of the lost online generation, which has a weak understanding of beauty and even less of feelings.
A tastefully made character drama about a high-profile court case of the internet era.
At the beginning of the 17th century, when Ivan Susanin was alive, surnames had not yet properly started to appear among people of humble origin.
They used to be referred to as "so-and-so, son of so-and-so".
That is, patronymics were in use - nicknames based on the father's name.
But sometimes, for example in the case of a father's repeated marriages, a matronymic was used - a nickname based on the mother's name.
Susanin is exactly such a case: "Ivan, son of Susanna".
The serfs of small landowners indeed went a long time without surnames - what's the need for them, when you have 20 souls and everyone is constantly in sight.
But the owners of vast estates were forced to give their peasants surnames.
Thus, the serfs of Prince Andrey Cherkassky all had surnames by the beginning of the 18th century.
In the 19th century, even small landowners did not keep peasants on the land, but let them go on quitrent - let them earn a living by craft and pay the landlord.
Such a peasant was supposed to have a passport, where the surname should be written.
By the time serfdom was abolished in Central Russia, 55% of the serfs had been released on quitrent.
And that means, they already had surnames.
Capital city criminal investigators flew in to investigate the explosion in Novosibirsk.
Forensic experts from the central office and staff from the forensic center arrived in Novosibirsk to assist with the investigation of a gas explosion in a house on Lineynaya, 39, reports NGS.
According to the investigation, the accused, Irina Urbakh and Evgeny Kavun, posing as employees of the fictitious organization "Mezhregiongaz", inspected and repaired gas equipment.
They used low-quality spare parts, worked carelessly, and on the contrary, overcharged for their services, reports the agency citing an informed source.
On the eve of the tragedy on Lineynaya, a man and a woman visited three apartments in building No. 39, where they were changing stove hoses.
So, in one of the apartments, they installed a water hose instead of a gas one.
However, Kavun denies this.
According to him, this is impossible, everything was certified.
As a result of their actions, a leak and explosion of a gas-air mixture occurred in one of the apartments.
Two entrances collapsed - one completely, the other partially.
This led to a significant collapse of the building, resulting in the death of 13 people.
Earlier, suspects were arrested in connection with the house explosion case in Novosibirsk.
The fraudsters themselves came from Omsk.
In St. Petersburg, they managed to avoid a storm surge.

Specialists were able to prevent the flood by closing the dam a day earlier.
On Friday, the threat of flooding sharply increased in Saint Petersburg due to bad weather in the city.
The marine storm surge was successfully prevented due to the timely closure of the dam.
The potential flood could have been the 32nd in a row, reports the St. Petersburg publication Neva.Today.
The water level reached 184 centimeters, but thanks to the closure of the gates in the Gulf of Finland, the water remained at a mark of 168 centimeters, which is only seven centimeters above the lower threshold of the dangerous flood level (from 161 to 210 centimeters).
The weather conditions were complicated by gusty winds, which at times reached speeds of 20-25 meters per second.
The dam has been reopened now, the water level has dropped, and vessels can once again navigate the Gulf of Finland.
It should be noted that ten meteorological stations on the eastern side of the Gulf of Finland are monitoring the water level situation.
This allows to prevent flooding, which may follow the intensification of wind.
In Turkey, 8 people have been arrested in connection with the shortcomings in the collapsed buildings.
In the Turkish province of Şanlıurfa, 8 people have been arrested in connection with construction defects found in buildings that collapsed as a result of an earthquake.
As reported by Armenpress, this information comes from Habertürk.
As a result of the earthquake, registered in Turkey on February 6, more than 20,000 people died.
The number of injured exceeds 80 thousand.
It is noted that the earthquake is the strongest since 1939.
The 7.7 magnitude earthquake was followed by hundreds of underground tremors, which were felt not only in 10 provinces of Turkey, but also in neighboring Syria.
Pashinyan sent congratulatory messages to the Supreme Leader of Iran and the country's president.
Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan sent congratulatory messages to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Seyyed Ali Khamenei, and the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ebrahim Raisi, on the occasion of the 44th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.
This was reported by Armenpress, according to the Department of Information and Public Relations of the Prime Minister's Office of the Republic of Armenia.
The message to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution of Iran, Sayyid Ali Khamenei, states:
"Your Eminence,
I heartily congratulate you on the 44th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution victory.
The warm and friendly Armenian-Iranian relations with centuries-old roots, rich history and traditions hold special significance for our two countries.
More than three decades have passed since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Republic of Armenia and the Islamic Republic of Iran, and we are witnesses to a stable and steady bilateral cooperation.
I am confident that the Armenian-Iranian friendly relations, forged in an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust, will achieve even greater accomplishments in the future for the benefit of the peoples of Armenia and Iran.
Taking this opportunity, I wish you robust health and many years of life.
In the congratulatory message sent to Ebrahim Raisi, it specifically states: "Your Excellency, please accept heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to you and the friendly people of Iran on the occasion of the 44th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution.
The unshakeable Armenian-Iranian relations, based on centuries of history and mutual respect, hold special significance for the Republic of Armenia.
I am confident that as a result of our joint efforts, we will be able to elevate our intergovernmental cooperation to a new level, the multi-sectoral agenda of which will be further expanded for the benefit of the prosperity of our two friendly nations and the security of our countries.
Emphasizing the importance of our views on establishing and strengthening regional peace and stability, I confirm the official invitation extended to you during my visit to Tehran last year to visit Armenia.
Taking this opportunity, I wish you new achievements, and to the friendly people of Iran - stable peace.

Caption for the video: WW2 bomb explosion in Great Yarmouth is caught on camera
In England, in the port city of Great Yarmouth, a World War II-era aerial bomb exploded on Friday as sappers were trying to defuse it.
A powerful explosion could be heard for tens of kilometers, but there were no casualties.
The Norfolk County Police announced that, although the explosion was unplanned, none of the military personnel involved in defusing the bomb were injured.
The device detonated shortly after the disarmament work began.
Fortunately, all the personnel are safe.
"The departments have begun assessing the damage," Norfolk Police Chief Assistant Nick Davison told reporters.
Local residents are writing on social media that the explosion shook houses at a distance of 24 km.

Caption to the photo: The explosion occurred contrary to the plans of the sappers, but there were no fatalities or injuries.
A 250-kilogram bomb was found during construction work on the banks of the Yar River, at the mouth of which, on the shore of the North Sea, stands Great Yarmouth.
Before attempting to defuse the bomb, the sappers built a protective sand barrier around it, and a cordon, into which outsiders were not allowed, was set up at a distance of 200 meters.
Initially, on Thursday, the bomb disposal experts planned to use a robot to cut the detonator off the bomb, but the attempt was unsuccessful. Then, as reported by local press, they decided to use the technique of "slow burning" the explosives.
The explosion occurred during this burning process.
During the Second World War, the Nazis dropped hundreds of thousands of bombs on Britain.
During the eight-month intensive bombing campaign from autumn 1940 to spring 1941, known as the "Blitz", 450,000 bombs were dropped on Britain.
Among Belarusian researchers, women make up almost 40%
In Belarus, the proportion of women among researchers is 38.9%, reported BELTA, citing Alesya Solovey, a scientific researcher at the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences.
The proportion of women among candidates of sciences and doctors of sciences is also increasing: women make up 41.1% of candidates of sciences and 21% of doctors of sciences.
In all fields of science, except for technical ones, the proportion of women has exceeded 50%.
The most feminized field of scientific knowledge is medical sciences, in which the proportion of women is 64.4%.
Only in technical sciences do men predominate, women make up 26.7%.
In the National Academy of Sciences, the proportion of women among researchers is 49.1% - this is 10.2% more than in the republic as a whole.
Among candidates of sciences, the proportion of women is 46%, while among doctors of sciences, it is 20%.
Among the professorial and teaching staff in higher education institutions, more than half are women (57%).
Among the vice-rectors for scientific, educational, and upbringing work, every third one is a woman (31.8%), among deans - 38.7%, deputy deans - 44.6%, and heads of departments - 42.5%.
More than 60% of senior lecturers and lecturers are women.
The proportion of women among associate professors in the department is high (55.2%).
According to a public opinion survey conducted by the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences last year, the majority of Belarusians do not support gender stereotypes about women's capabilities in science.
63.5% (56.5% of men and 69% of women) disagree to some extent with the gender stereotype that "science is a male field of activity".
More than half of the country's residents do not hold the opinion that a woman is less competent as a scientist - 66.1% (59% of men and 71.6% of women).
"The transformation in the public consciousness of gender perceptions about women's research competence contributes to attracting young women to science, developing their creative potential, and forming a successful role model of a female scientist, including through the transfer of experience and the institution of mentorship," noted Alesia Solovey.
Every year on February 11, International Day of Women and Girls in Science is celebrated.
The holiday was established to encourage women and girls to engage in the field of science, to promote the development of scientific careers by women, and to recognize the achievements of women in science.
According to UNESCO data, women make up 30% of the total number of researchers worldwide.
The likelihood of a future increase in the key rate is higher than its decrease.
Such a statement was made by the Chairwoman of the Bank of Russia, Elvira Nabiullina, following the meeting of its Board of Directors on February 10, which decided to maintain this rate at 7.50%.
The head of the regulator, in particular, noted that important changes have occurred recently.
On one hand, the conditions of foreign trade have noticeably worsened - the prices for Russian oil have decreased.
On the other hand, the economic situation is shaping up better than the October forecast.
The shift in demand structure continues: consumption remains restrained, private investments are slowing down, but budget expenditures are growing.
At the same time, inflationary risks have generally increased.
"Therefore, this year the likelihood of a rate increase exceeds the likelihood of its decrease.
"The appropriateness of changing the rate will be determined by the development of the situation," said E. Nabiullina.
In addition to the more pronounced influence of budgetary policy, she noted three risks.
Firstly, the rapid increase in consumption under conditions of heightened inflation expectations, in case the factors restraining consumer activity weaken.
Secondly, there is an increasing shortage of labor and a lag in productivity growth compared to wage growth.
And there are still risks of further tightening of sanctions restrictions.
Speaking about the regulator's future decisions, the Chairperson of the Bank of Russia noted that, despite the previously noted strengthening of pro-inflationary factors, the inflation forecast for the current year remains at the level of 5 - 7%.
According to her, this may require a higher trajectory of the key rate than was assumed in October.
In the updated forecast of the Central Bank for this and the next year, the ranges for the average key rate have been raised by half a percentage point, to 7.0-9.0% per annum for 2023 and 6.5 - 7.5% per annum for 2024.
"This does not rule out the possibility of a rate cut this year, but its likelihood and scale have decreased."
Conversely, the likelihood has increased that a certain rate hike may be needed in 2024 to align inflation with the target of around 4%", concluded the head of the Bank of Russia.
The Bank of Russia has approved the requirements for the procedure of creating special closed-end mutual investment funds (PIF), consisting of blocked foreign securities.
The regulator informs that such securities will be removed from the composition of existing retail mutual funds.
This will allow the management of remaining liquid assets to be launched and operations with investment shares to be resumed.
If more than 10% of the retail mutual fund consists of blocked securities, then the management company must allocate them into a separate closed mutual fund by September 1, 2023.
Each shareholder will be issued shares of the new fund in a quantity equal to the shares of the main fund.
Also, there is a possibility of changing the status of a retail fund to a closed one.
For funds with less than 10% of blocked securities, the new requirements are not mandatory.
However, the management company has the right to allocate blocked assets into a separate closed mutual fund.
In addition, a requirement is introduced to inform shareholders about the consequences of transferring blocked securities to a special mutual fund.
In the future, in the event of the realization of such securities, management companies are obliged to pay the owners of investment shares no less than 90% of the proceeds on a quarterly basis, according to a statement from the Bank of Russia.
In addition to summarizing the industry results, the experts also provided a forecast for the current year.
According to the Analytical and Expertise Center of Promsvyazbank, in 2022, passenger turnover of air transport in Russia decreased by 6.3%, and passenger transportation decreased by 14.2%.
The volume of passenger transportation amounted to 95.2 million people, and passenger turnover - 228.0 billion passenger-kilometers.
International passenger transportation amounted to 17.2 million people, which is 26.7% lower than the previous year's level, domestic transportation - 78.0 million people (-10.9%).
PSB analysts note that state support programs have influenced the relative stability of the industry.
In 2022, a program to stimulate domestic tourism was in operation, for which 38.8 billion rubles were allocated.
Tourists could receive a partial refund for tours with flights, arranged by Rostourism.
Several state support programs were also implemented to ensure the accessibility of air transportation, including subsidizing citizen transportation, developing regional transportation, etc., with a total budget of more than 27.5 billion rubles.
In the second quarter of 2022, the government decided to allocate an additional 100 billion rubles to airlines and recapitalize "Aeroflot" with 52.5 billion rubles.
"Despite the sanction pressure on the Russian aviation industry, as a result of the development of domestic tourism and the opening of new international routes, as well as the continued subsidization of the industry by the state (so far, 25.3 billion rubles have been allocated), in 2023, passenger traffic, according to our estimates, will increase by 6.4%, to 101.2 million people (domestic passenger traffic will be 91.1 million people), according to the forecast of Rosaviation, up to 103.0 million people," - share the forecasts of PSB analysts.
Terrorist attack in Jerusalem, a 6-year-old child killed
Two people, including a 6-year-old child, fell victim to a terrorist attack in Jerusalem: a car at high speed crashed into a bus stop.
Six more people were injured.
The driver of the car was shot dead on the spot.
It was later revealed that this was a 31-year-old Palestinian from East Jerusalem.
Law enforcement agencies classified his actions as a terrorist act, the terrorist's relatives have been detained, and the house has been sealed off.
At the same time, according to reports from Israeli media, the attacker had mental health issues and was only discharged from the hospital this week.
Austria is once again tightening control at the border with Hungary following another surge of migrants in recent months.
Officials say that many people remain at the border in their cars, waiting to cross over to the Austrian side.
Thus, this becomes a signal to the Austrian authorities that they have already undergone the asylum procedure in Hungary.
Based on existing agreements, Austria believes that migrants are obliged to stay in the country where the request was submitted.
At the same time, Austrian authorities consider it wrong to automatically send back to Hungary those wishing to cross the border: many migrants become victims of smugglers and find themselves between two border posts without the right to return to Hungary.
That is exactly why, according to the police, there is a need to strengthen control.
The decision to tighten inspections by Vienna followed the promise of European Union leaders to allocate more funds for cameras, drones, and watchtowers to guard the borders of the union.
According to the Frontex agency, last year the number of illegal migrants who arrived in the EU and applied for refugee status for the first time exceeded the figures for 2016 and amounted to more than 330 thousand.
The cargo spacecraft "Progress 83" successfully docked with the ISS.
The automatic resupply spacecraft "Progress 83" successfully docked with the International Space Station on Saturday at 3.45 Greenwich Mean Time, completing a two-day orbital flight.
The docking occurred at an altitude of 269 statute miles above the southern part of the Pacific Ocean.
The docking broadcast was conducted by NASA's Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas.
In Russia, the docking was monitored by specialists from the Flight Control Center.
From the side of the ISS, the cargo ship was greeted by astronauts Sergey Prokopyev, Dmitry Petelin, and Anna Kikina.
The "Progress MS-22" spacecraft delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS, including 720 kg of refueling fuel, 420 kg of water, and about 1,354 kg of dry cargo.
In addition, the ship delivered food for Russian astronauts.
"Progress 83" successfully launched from the Russian cosmodrome "Baikonur" on Thursday.
At the same time, Roscosmos reported a depressurization of "Progress MS-21", prepared for undocking from the ISS and subsequent flooding on February 18.
As clarified by the company's press service, the ship's transition hatch was immediately closed: "Progress MS-21" is isolated from the general volume of the ISS.
The reasons for its depressurization are being investigated.
Also, the Mission Control Center reported that the ISS crew is not in danger: "The temperature and pressure on board the station are normal.
The crew's life and health are not in danger, they are feeling well.
"Cases of birth tourism have increased."
How pregnant Russian women got stuck in Argentina
The Argentine Migration Service has begun to suspend and cancel the residency status of Russians who obtained it through childbirth, but did not remain living in the country.
Earlier, the republic's authorities denied entry to the country to several pregnant Russian women, who were suspected of arriving for the purposes of "birth tourism".
On February 11, they were finally allowed into Argentina by court decision.
More details in the material from "Gazeta.Ru".
The Argentine Migration Service has begun to suspend and cancel the residency permits of Russians who obtained them through the birth of a child, but did not remain living in the country.
Florence Carignano, the director of the service, told this to C5N channel.
"What we are doing is suspending the residence permits of those Russians who came to get a residence permit because their child is Argentinean, but at the same time spent more time outside (of Argentina) than inside (the country)," she explained.
According to her, when the issue of Argentine citizenship for a Russian citizen will be considered in court, the immigration service will submit data that the residence permit was suspended because this person "spent a month in Argentina and never came back".
Kariniano warned that Russians who received a residence permit after the birth of a child and left may have it revoked.
Against this backdrop, it became known on February 9 that three pregnant Russian women were "stranded" at an airport in Argentina due to being denied entry into the country.
According to the head of the consular department of the Russian Federation embassy in Argentina, Georgy Polin, the diplomatic mission associates the incident with the possibility that the republic's authorities may have considered the information provided by the girls upon entry to be incomplete or false.
One of them arrived on February 7, and two more - on the evening of February 8, reports RIA Novosti.
The diplomat emphasized that more pregnant women had flown to Argentina, but these specific three were issued a prohibition from entering the country.
"They were not allowed into the country in accordance with the migration law, where one of the grounds for denial of entry is the provision of incomplete, false, distorted information," Polin explained.
On Saturday, February 11, the Argentine immigration service, by court order, allowed pregnant Russian citizens into the country, reported lawyer Christian Rubilar.
"An hour ago, they were all allowed to enter Argentina," TASS quotes his words.
Rubilar noted that the immigration service changed its decision after the court ruling.
It is easier for foreign parents of a child born in Argentina to obtain a passport of the republic.
It allows for short-term trips to 171 countries without a visa, including EU countries, the UK, and Japan, notes RBC.
In early January 2023, The Guardian newspaper wrote about a "boom in birth tourism" to Argentina among Russians.
According to Polina, in 2022, between 2,000 and 2,500 Russian citizens moved to the republic.
Many of them, the diplomat noted, are Russian women planning to give birth there.
"In 2023, this number could increase to 10 thousand," he said.
In turn, Karinyano previously claimed that in 2022, about 10.5 thousand Russian citizens arrived in Argentina, and in the last few months - more than 5.8 thousand pregnant women.
On February 9, it became known how rental prices in St. Petersburg have changed.
It has decreased in price by 10%.
It is known that rent across the country has become 25% more expensive, reports Patrulny Petersburg, citing RBC.
The average monthly rent for an apartment in St. Petersburg at the beginning of 2023 was 27,000 rubles.
A one-room apartment cost 25,000 rubles per month, a studio - 22,000 rubles per month, a two-room apartment - 36,000 rubles per month.
Experts believe that this trend may change by spring, when many citizens who have been abroad will return home.
The reasons for the interrogation of women in a foreign country have become known.
The Argentine migration service denied entry to six pregnant Russian women, as the purpose of their visit, which they had stated, turned out to be false.
This is reported by TASS, citing the Todo Noticias TV channel.
For five hours, pregnant women were asked questions about the purpose of their visit.
Most of them admitted that they came to a foreign country to give birth.
In connection with this, the country's representatives did not allow Russian women to enter Argentina.
As clarified in the publication, the migration service has a procedure in place if there are suspicions about "fake" travelers.
So, if it is noticeable that a woman is in her 33rd week of pregnancy, she does not have a return ticket to Russia, and she cannot clearly explain where she is going on vacation, she immediately becomes suspicious to the immigration service.
Moreover, experts clarify that it is difficult to be a traveler "under such conditions".
The artist's decision to leave the theater was planned.
Laureate of the State Prize of the Russian Federation, Alexander Filippenko, stated that the decision of the Mossovet Theater not to renew his contract was planned, and moreover, everything was agreed in advance with the management.
He told about this in an interview with the "Interfax" agency.
In the productions he participated in, he invited artists from the second cast.
The People's Artist of the Russian Federation clarified that his contract ended in 2022.
All the details had long been discussed with the representatives of the theater.
Moreover, everyone knew that the star was not planning to renew the contract.
Filippenko noted that the management was accommodating and prepared all the documents.
So, he assures that he "didn't let anyone down".
In addition to this, it became known that the artist emigrated from Russia.
He flew to his heiress in Latvia.
Filippenko is planning to undergo "long-term treatment" in a foreign country.
As stated in the publication, currently the film actor is working as a guest actor in a Moscow theater.
According to the publication, the artist performed in such plays at the Mossovet Theater as "Shakespeare's Hamlet" and "The Taming of the Shrew", "Uncle Vanya", as well as "Three Sisters".
From the private sector territories on Friday, February 10th, 340 thousand cubic meters of snow were removed in the Kalininsky Administrative District.
This information was shared by the city's mayor's office.
At the moment, there are more than four hundred streets in the Kalininsky district of the private sector, from which snow needs to be removed by spring.
The roads will be cleaned in two stages.
The first will end on the fifteenth of February, and the second will take place from the first of March to the fifteenth of April.
114 units of special equipment and 123 workers will participate in the cleanup.

Kirkorov won a lawsuit against a fisherman.
In the lawsuit, the man claimed the artist's construction was illegal, but he did not show up for the hearing.
A fisherman sued the music performer, Philipp Kirkorov, over an allegedly illegally installed pier at his suburban Moscow cottage.
This is reported by "Channel Five".
Nevertheless, the Saratov fisherman failed to win the case.
The Odintsovo City Court reviewed the complaint against the singer. According to the lawyer, documents and design projects were presented in court, which confirmed the legality of all structures installed on the territory of the celebrity's house.
As clarified by the head of the law firm, Alexander Dobrovinsky, the construction of the pier left the plaintiff with no chance to go fishing.
The application for the performer was submitted on January 11.
The celebrity lawyer jokingly said that the man was probably planning to fish exclusively from the artist's house.
Ironically, Dobrovinsky clarified that he would ask Kirkorov to provide his balcony to the plaintiff for fishing.
He emphasized that from that spot, there is a possibility to cast the spinning rod further.
The sleep specialist named the reasons for sleep problems.
Sleep specialist Sofia Cherkasova talked about food and habits that interfere with healthy sleep.
As the specialist noted, problems with sleep often arise from products containing caffeine.
Primarily, this refers to tea, coffee, chocolate, and any desserts containing cocoa.
Their use before sleep should be limited, as they not only interfere with falling asleep, but also make sleep "fragmented", thus preventing the body from fully recovering.
According to the doctor, it is better to stop consuming caffeine-containing products 6-8 hours before sleep.
Otherwise, they contribute to lowering the threshold of excitability of the nervous system and as a result - difficulties with falling asleep arise.
Alcohol also negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
The doctor clarifies that small doses of alcoholic beverages promote relaxation and do not affect sleep.
However, amounts exceeding 36 grams in terms of pure alcohol lead to various sleep disorders, such as superficial sleep and frequent nighttime awakenings.
In addition, to prevent problems with falling asleep, the sleep specialist recommends avoiding spicy food and large portions.
Large volumes of food and spicy food contribute to an increase in the body's internal temperature, which negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
For a healthy sleep, it is necessary not only to maintain an external temperature regime: the optimal air temperature is 18-20 degrees - but also the absence of elevated body temperature.
In Cherkasova's opinion, one should not overindulge in heavy food before sleep, as it will not allow the body to fully recover and rest: it will be forced to expend energy on digestion.
The doctor also reminded that the lack of healthy sleep and accumulated sleep deprivation affect the quality of life and usual activities, therefore it is extremely important to adhere to the sleep and rest regime and allow the body to recover.
Bloomberg named Trump's competitor in the upcoming presidential elections: World: Politics: INFOX.ru
According to the agency, the main competitor of the former president in the upcoming elections will be Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.
Republican DeSantis has not yet officially announced his intention to run for the presidential seat, however, Bloomberg sources report that he is already preparing for the primaries.

The agency reports that the team of the Florida governor is seeking support among Republican colleagues from Iowa, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and other states. Bloomberg experts named DeSantis as the main potential competitor of Donald Trump.
Experts believe that the current governor of Florida is well-known enough that he does not need to start his election campaign right now, and they also note his ability to raise funds.
Ron DeSantis was a supporter of Donald Trump's nomination for president in 2017, and he may compete against him in the upcoming presidential elections in November 2024.
Donald Trump officially announced his intention to run for president "to make America great again"... during a speech in front of his supporters in Florida.
The incumbent President Joe Biden, despite assurances from his team about the intention to participate in the 60th presidential elections, stated the absence of a firm decision on this matter.
Hundreds of protests against pension reform will take place in France on Saturday.
The fourth day of mass protests against pension reform is being held by French trade unions on Saturday.
Hundreds of demonstrations will take place across the country, report French media.
After a certain decrease in the number of participants in protest actions last Tuesday compared to the first two "days of mobilization", trade unions hope to bring a larger number of protesters to the streets this time, taking into account those citizens who did not have the opportunity to participate in demonstrations on a weekday.
Law enforcement agencies are expecting between 600,000 to 800,000 protesters across the country, including between 90,000 to 120,000 in Paris, according to media reports.

The next mass protest actions are scheduled for February 16.
As reported, on January 10, French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne presented a government-developed pension reform project, which proposes raising the retirement age from 62 to 64 years.
It is assumed that the established retirement age threshold will gradually shift from 62 to 64 years, increasing by three months per year, and this process will continue until 2030.
The new regime will be applied, starting with generations of French people born in September 1961 or later.
During his 2022 election campaign, French President Emmanuel Macron expressed his determination to carry out pension reform by the end of his second presidential term.
On February 6, the National Assembly of France began reviewing the government's pension reform project.

The "Progress MS-21" depressurization occurred on the ISS: February 12, 2023, 00:12
TASS - KAZINFORM - Roscosmos reported a depressurization of "Progress MS-21", prepared for undocking from the ISS, according to MIA "Kazinform" citing TASS.
"The outline of the cargo ship "Progress MS-21", which is scheduled to be flooded on February 18, has been depressurized, according to telemetry data received at the Mission Control Center," - was reported by the press service of Roscosmos.
As noted, he is currently isolated from the general volume of the station.
The causes of the incident are being investigated, it did not affect either the docking of the cargo ship "Progress MS-22", or the further flight program of the ISS.
The situation was commented on by Sergey Krikalev, the Executive Director of Roscosmos for manned space programs.
"A coolant leak from the thermal regulation system occurred on the cargo ship, which has been docked at the station for several months.
"The situation is somewhat similar to what happened with our ship ("Soyuz MS-22" - TASS note) in mid-December," he said, noting that the commission that analyzed the incident with the "Soyuz" concluded that the leak was caused by a micrometeoroid.
Roscosmos will conduct an analysis to ensure there are no problems with future launches.
"We need to conduct a thorough analysis to ensure that this cause does not apply to similar structures in future launches.
"Here is the main task that will now stand before us," he said.
According to the executive director, it is necessary to conduct an analysis from the perspective of preparing the ship for launch, the materials that were used, and the technologies that were applied in the assembly of the radiator.
The same analysis was conducted in the case of the damaged radiator of the ship "Soyuz MS-22".
"The most important thing is to make sure that this is not some kind of systematic error," Krikalev added.
The Executive Director clarified that on Saturday a commission began its work, which will conduct an analysis of all possible causes.
"The ship was supposed to be undocked and descended from orbit two days before the launch of the Soyuz ship (Soyuz MS-23 - TASS note), so there will be no serious consequences for the crew's actions, for the crew's work... It will not affect the program from this point of view," Krikalev noted.
The "Progress MS-21" truck was launched from Baikonur on the "Soyuz-2.1a" carrier rocket on October 26.
In two days, he docked to the small research module "Search" of the Russian segment of the ISS.
The ship delivered over 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS.
NASA identified the location of the "Progress" depressurization.
The depressurization of the cargo ship "Progress MS-21" at the International Space Station (ISS) occurred in the thermal control system.
This was reported by a representative of the American Flight Control Center (FCC) during negotiations with the ISS crew, the broadcast was conducted by NASA.
Currently, according to NASA, the leakage of cooling liquid from "Progress" has stopped.
NASA believes that all the refrigerant has completely leaked out.
"This morning we had a coolant leak from the thermal regulation system into space, the coolant leak has stopped," - stated a representative of the American Mission Control Center (quote from "Interfax").
Earlier, due to depressurization, the "Progress" circuit was isolated.
"Roscosmos" reported that the astronauts are not in any danger.
"Progress MS-22" docked to the ISS today, February 11, and according to the plan, it will be de-orbited on February 18.

A fitness expert talked about outdoor winter workouts for weight loss.
A fitness expert named winter walks as a great way to lose weight without intense workouts.
Fitness expert Anthony Eng spoke about an effective outdoor interval training for weight loss.
The portal Eat This, Not That quotes his words.
The specialist named active winter walks as an excellent way to lose weight without intensive workouts, as well as to improve the condition of the cardiovascular system and psychological health.
"For the first five to ten minutes, walk at a normal pace to warm up your body and joints.
Then walk as fast as you can for one minute without breaking into a run.
"One minute - at a normal pace," Eng explains.
It is necessary to make three approaches.
Next, the specialist advises to do lunges or squats with weights for 15 seconds, after which walk at a comfortable speed for another 45 seconds.
This sequence needs to be repeated five times. Then Yeng suggests alternating between an active step (two minutes) and a calm one (one minute) three more times.
You should finish your walk with a five-minute stroll at a leisurely pace and a few stretching exercises.
All you need for this workout is 35 minutes in the fresh air.
Earlier, the sports master in athletics, Maxim Babenko-Kudryavtsev, gave advice on choosing equipment for winter runs in a comment to "Lenta.ru".
Thermal underwear, moisture-wicking items, and special lightweight but warm headgear will be needed.
"Running shoes for winter are characterized by denser materials, a higher platform, and a tread sole," the athlete explained.

The Head of Serpukhov checked the content of the apartment building
The Head of the Serpukhov urban district, Sergey Nikitenko, conducted a working tour of the territories.
Together with representatives of management organizations, he inspected the condition of apartment buildings and residential houses.
The addresses from which the most requests from residents came were under the strictest control.
- Many of the remarks are quite justified and primarily concern the cleaning of entrances and maintenance of common areas.
The residents of Serpukhov themselves are not standing aside and are actively fighting against the problem of vandalism, especially prevalent in terms of graffiti.
"We will address the issue taking into account the 'Safe Region' cameras," said the head of the municipality, Sergey Nikitenko.
Attention was also paid to the replacement of mailboxes, light bulbs, installation of wires in boxes, and untimely removal of garbage from container sites.
In the shortest possible time, the company's managers must solve all the tasks set before them.
The Deputy General Director of Russian Railways proposed to the Governor of the Irkutsk Region to develop new sales directions.
The Irkutsk region needs to continue exploring alternative sales markets, in addition to the Far East.
This includes the domestic market, as well as the ports of the Western direction, including the Azov-Black Sea basin.
The Deputy Director of Russian Railways, Alexey Shilo, made this proposal at a meeting with Governor Igor Kobzev, as reported by the regional government on February 10, 2023.
- As last year's experience showed, even despite the geographical location of the Irkutsk region, this decision can be extremely effective.
"It is important that the logistics services of companies constantly interact with our 'neighbors' (ports, operators, maritime transport) and find optimal pricing conditions for transporting their products according to new schemes," emphasized Alexey Shilo.
The Governor emphasized the importance of stable product shipment. The Irkutsk region is one of the richest in mineral resources in the Russian Federation and has significant reserves of stone and brown coal.
Approximately 25 enterprises are engaged in coal mining in the region.
The instability of product shipment for export has a negative impact on the financial and economic activities of coal mining companies.
Igor Kobzev also emphasized that the Irkutsk region is an export-oriented region, therefore it is necessary to increase the size of the monthly quotas for the transportation of timber and metallurgical industry products produced in the region to a level that ensures the stable operation of such enterprises.
- Understanding the importance of the Irkutsk region as an industrial center, we, for our part, will strive to do everything to provide support in terms of transportation volumes.
"If additional volumes of shipment for the domestic market appear, we are also ready to assist in this direction," said Alexey Shilo.
Konstantin Zaitsev held a meeting with the active citizens of the villages of Granovshchina and Khomutovo.
On the orders of the regional head Igor Kobzev, the Chairman of the Government of Priangarye, Konstantin Zaitsev, worked in the villages of Granovshchina and Khomutovo in the Irkutsk region today.
In the village of Granovshchina, the Prime Minister familiarized himself with the work of a new educational institution - the Granovsky School, which was opened in September 2022.
The object was erected within the framework of the federal project "Modern School" of the national project "Education".
The eight school blocks include: classrooms, a dining room, a food unit, an assembly hall, two sports halls, club rooms, a library, administrative offices, bathrooms, common recreation areas, and a medical unit.
240.8 million rubles were allocated from the federal budget for construction, over 512 million rubles were regional funds, and over 72 million rubles were municipal funds.
In addition, a regional subsidy was allocated for the purchase of equipment amounting to 64.2 million rubles.
After the opening of the school, in addition to the children from the village of Granovshchina, students from the Urikovskaya school also attended, which was undergoing major renovations.
More than 100 educators conduct the classes, of which nearly 90 are subject teachers.
In 2022, a bus was allocated to the school, purchased by the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation under a federal program.
The major renovation of Khomutovskaya Secondary School No. 2 began in 2022.
Elementary school students were assigned to Khomutovka School No. 1, while the upper grades are studying in the second building of School No. 2.
According to the renovation plan, the roof, engineering communications, windows, and accompanying elements will be replaced here, the facade will be repaired, and the interior finishing of the rooms will be carried out.
An important component of major repairs is the restoration of the heating point with water heating, instead of which dry heat was used.
The cost of all the work is over 80 million rubles.
The repair is in the final stage, there are problems with connecting to the power grid - there is a need to increase the power capacity, work is underway with the power supply organization.
In addition, in Granovshchina and Khomutovo, Konstantin Zaitsev held a meeting with citizens, some of whom were sold houses illegally connected to the electrical grid by developers.
It was decided that the network company will organize a personal reception next week to legally resolve these issues.
- Very often, the question of stable electricity supply is the main condition when buying a house, because the population is increasingly using electric power for heating.
Therefore, sellers sometimes arbitrarily connect houses to nearby networks, and this is already grounds for disconnecting the power supply.
Therefore, network companies in areas where active construction is underway should pay special attention to this issue, - emphasized Konstantin Zaitsev.
Anatoly Prokopyev evaluated the effectiveness of state support measures for peasant-farmer households of UOBO.
Head of the UOBO Anatoly Prokopyev visited three KFHs in the Ekhirit-Bulagatsky district today.
The head of the KFH in the village of Kapsal, Yulia Madaeva, received a grant for the development of her farm as a beginning farmer in 2014.
One of the main areas of activity of the farm is the production of livestock products.
The livestock population increases annually, and the gross production of meat and milk is also growing.
Later, thanks to the support of the state, there was an opportunity in 2019 to participate and win a grant in the form of subsidies for the development of a family dairy livestock farm.
As of today, the livestock population in the farm is about 150 heads, 60 of which are cows.
In addition, they are engaged in the cultivation of cereal crops and sowing annual fodder crops here.
Thanks to the activities of Viktor Katanaev's farm, the area of Kharyashino in the village of Kulunkun has been reclassified as a populated area.
The farm is engaged in breeding and fattening dairy cattle.
In 2014, a grant was received for the development of a family dairy livestock farm for 60 heads.
As of today, the livestock population of cattle is 150 heads.
Also, for many years they have been engaged in growing potatoes here.
The head of the farm enterprise strives to create all necessary conditions for the team's work and living.
There is now an entire village on the farm's territory.
Anatoly Prokopyev took personal control over the issue of constructing two kilometers of road from the Kharyashino area to Ust-Ordynsky.
The main activities of the KFH Stalina Mogzoeva in the village of Otonkhoy are cattle breeding and buffalo farming.
In 2020, the farm participated in a competitive selection process and received the "AGROSTARTUP" grant for the development of a meat-oriented peasant farming.
These funds were used to purchase a tractor trailer, two balers, and a mower.
The head of the farm annually increases the livestock population and boosts the gross production of meat.
In addition, the farm cultivates annual fodder crops on an area of 40 hectares.
Stalina Mogzoeva plans to open a fattening site.
Following the visit to three farms, the district head noted that the measures of state support are effective, needed, and necessary.
- The Irkutsk Region Government pays great attention to agriculture.
Therefore, state support should not only be maintained, but also increased and enhanced.
In turn, we must be the guarantor of food security.
The agricultural producers of the district are fulfilling this role honorably, - emphasized Anatoly Prokopyev.
The crossing at the Armenian-Turkish border has been opened for the first time in decades for the delivery of humanitarian aid.
The Margara-Alidjan border point on the Turkey-Armenia border was opened for the first time in three decades for the delivery of humanitarian aid to earthquake victims.
This is reported by Turkish and Armenian media.
This same crossing was used to deliver humanitarian aid from Turkey to Armenia after the devastating earthquake in 1988, notes the Turkish agency "Anadolu".
On Saturday, Armenia sent five trucks with 100 tons of food, medicine, water, and other emergency aid packages to the city of Adiyaman in southern Turkey, reported Serdar Kılıç, Ankara's special representative at the Armenian-Turkish negotiations.
He expressed gratitude to the Vice-Speaker of the Armenian Parliament, Ruben Rubinyan, and the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Armenia, Vaan Kostanyan.
"I will always remember the help provided by the people of Armenia to alleviate the suffering of our people in the earthquake-stricken region," Kylch wrote on his Twitter page.
The Press Secretary of the Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Vaan Unanyan, in turn, reported that trucks with humanitarian aid crossed the border via the Margara bridge and are heading to the region affected by the earthquake.
As reported by Public Radio of Armenia, the last time a car crossed the Margara Bridge was 30 years ago, in 1993.
Since then, the Armenian-Turkish land border has been closed.
The Turkish agency "Anadolu" provides different data and writes that the Margara-Alidjan border point was last used for delivering humanitarian aid to Armenia to mitigate the consequences of the devastating earthquake in 1988.
Then, aid collected through the Turkish Red Crescent was delivered to the disaster zone in Armenia.
Earlier, Armenia sent 27 rescuers to Turkey and another 29 rescuers to Syria to the areas affected by the earthquake.
According to the latest data, over 25 thousand people have died in Turkey and Syria from a devastating earthquake that occurred on Monday.
On February 11, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced that there are already known to be 21,848 fatalities in Turkey.
The Syrian side reported 3,553 fatalities.
The relationship between Turkey and Armenia is primarily overshadowed by Ankara's refusal to recognize the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire, as well as its support for Baku during the First and Second Karabakh wars.
Recently, Yerevan and Ankara have made a series of attempts to normalize relations.
In 2021, Armenia and Turkey appointed special representatives who met several times in Vienna to discuss normalization issues.
In February 2022, commercial air travel between Yerevan and Istanbul resumed after a two-year hiatus.
In July 2022, Ankara and Yerevan agreed on the possibility of opening the land border for citizens of third countries as soon as possible.

"Fernandes is Makelele plus Lampard.
If you need him to play in the position of Makelele, he can perform very well there.

Famous sports commentator Dmitry Guberniev commented on the fact that midfielder Pavel Mamaev has decided to end his playing career.
"Now it will be possible to cast a bust in the hero's homeland.
He made a big mistake and for most people, he will be remembered not as a footballer, but as a footballer-lawbreaker.
But he is still far from Kokorin.
Because no one has managed to waste their potential like Kokorin did.
Despite all his talents, Mamaev was periodically noticeable.
"I can only wish him luck and to realize himself somewhere else," Metaratings.ru quotes Guberniev.
The last club of the 34-year-old midfielder was "Khimki".
The suburban Moscow club decided not to renew the contract with the midfielder in the summer of 2022.
Previously, Mamaev played for "Torpedo", CSKA, "Krasnodar" and "Rostov".
Mamaev is the champion of Russia, a three-time winner of the Russian Cup, and a two-time winner of the country's Super Cup as part of CSKA.

A tanker carrying diesel from a vessel that previously sailed under the Russian flag was not allowed into the port of Spain.
The Maritime Command of Tarragona of the Main Directorate of the Merchant Fleet under the Ministry of Transport of Spain has banned the Maersk Magellan vessel from entering the city's port to unload diesel fuel, as the cargo originates from the Nobel vessel, which sailed under the Russian flag until July 1, 2022, according to the Spanish Ministry of Transport.
"The Maritime Command of Tarragona of the Main Directorate of the Merchant Fleet under the Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Development has prohibited the entry into the port of Tarragona for the unloading of diesel fuel on the vessel "Maersk Magellan" flying the Singaporean flag, because the cargo it carries comes from the vessel "Nobel" under the Cameroonian flag, which sailed under the Russian flag until July 1, 2022," the ministry said in a statement.
The measure was taken in accordance with European Union legislation, which prohibits access for any vessel registered under the Russian flag from April 16, 2022, or that changed its flag after February 24, 2022.
The ministry clarified that the inspection was carried out on February 9, after which the ban was agreed upon.
The ministry reminded that this is not the first case when ships are prohibited from entering Spanish ports.
In April 2022, the vessel Black Star sailing under the Maltese flag was denied access to the port of Barcelona. It was transporting cargo from a ship under the Russian flag.
In 2022, following the intensification of anti-Russian sanctions, the EU, USA, and the UK imposed restrictions on the supply of Russian petroleum products, and then decided to limit fuel prices.

The problems encountered by pregnant Russian women entering Argentina have been explained.
According to the expert's assessment, due to the influx of people wishing to give birth in Argentina, the country's authorities have started to monitor more closely the entry of foreign citizens into their territory.
The difficulties with pregnant Russian women entering Argentina are related to the fact that the country's authorities are not interested in a massive influx of foreigners wishing to obtain citizenship for their children and residency for themselves, and then leave.
"Lenta.ru" reports this, citing Professor Viktor Heifetz of SPbGU, the editor-in-chief of the "Latin America" journal.
According to him, no country supports such a practice.
He noted that in Argentina, they do not approve of turning the country into a transit point, rather than a destination.
This concerns those who violate constitutional practice.
As the expert explained, the child will retain Argentine citizenship, but the decision to grant Argentine passports to the parents after obtaining residency will be made by the court.
In the event that it turns out they actually did not live in Argentina and left immediately, their citizenship application may be denied.
This concerns not only Russians, but also citizens of other countries.
Recently, as the specialist pointed out, childbirth tours to Argentina have become especially popular among Russians and Ukrainians.
Let's recall, Argentina grants citizenship by "jus soli", that is, if a person was born on its territory.
An Argentine passport allows for visa-free visits to 170 countries, including EU states and the United Kingdom.
It was previously reported that Argentina began revoking the residence permits of Russians who obtained the document through the birth of a child, but left the country.
Buenos Aires is interested in reducing such incidents.
It has also become known that six pregnant Russian citizens were denied entry to Argentina due to suspicions of providing false information about the purpose of their trip.
In Russia, the opening of hundreds of new fitness clubs is predicted.
In Russia, there is a resurgence of citizens' interest in fitness services, which allows market participants to expand their business.
In the current year, more than 400 new facilities, predominantly small-scale, may open in the country.
About 400 new fitness clubs may open in Russia, increasing their total number by 5 percent.
As reported by "Kommersant", in this case, several dozen players may leave the Russian market.
By the end of the year, there will be about 8.6 thousand clubs in Russia.
According to the publication, most of the new clubs are small-scale projects with minimal initial investments and quick returns.
Such data is provided by representatives of the National Fitness Community.
In a conversation with the publication, Olga Kiseleva, the President of the Association of Fitness Industry Operators, noted that 340-420 new fitness clubs will be small, while the rest will occupy an area of more than 500 square meters.
NFS President Elena Silina noted that since 2020, there have been more club closures each year than openings.
Over the last three years, their number has decreased by 37 percent.
Meanwhile, independent analysts provide different figures.
According to "Kontur.Focus", over the last three years, the number of organizations with the main activity being "fitness center operations" has increased by 10.1 percent, and now there are 5.12 thousand of them.
The industry suffered significant losses due to the pandemic, however, it began to recover as early as 2021.
According to 2GIS data, there are 4,5 thousand fitness clubs in Russian cities with a population of over one million.
Russians have started paying more attention to physical activity, as evidenced by the increase in fitness club attendance.
As of January 2023, attendance increased by 9.3 percent year on year.
As Silina noted, if the trend can be maintained, the industry will return to pre-crisis levels by the end of the year.
The management company from Kirov had its license revoked.
The Arbitration Court of the Kirov Region annulled the license for entrepreneurial activity in managing apartment buildings, issued to the management company "Zabota".
In the Kirov region, the regional Arbitration Court has annulled a license previously issued to the management company "Zabota" for conducting entrepreneurial activities in managing apartment buildings.
According to the regional State Housing Inspection, the court decision was made in November 2022, but it only came into legal force in February 2023.
The arbitration court revoked the management company's license for repeatedly ignoring the directives of the State Housing Inspectorate.
At present, all the properties that were under the management of "Zaboty" have been removed from the register of licenses for conducting entrepreneurial activities in managing apartment buildings.
Their total area was 64.8 thousand square meters.
All the houses are located in the regional center.
The administration of Kirov is aware that they have been left without a management company.
In accordance with Russian legislation, the State Housing Inspection informed the city hall about the current situation.
Let us remind you that in January 2023, the governor of the Kirov region, Alexander Sokolov, set a task for the employees of the State Housing Inspection to eliminate 2/3 of the management companies in the region by spring, as there are too many of them.
The legality of the governor's demands raised doubts among the Kirov communists.
They appealed to the regional prosecutor's office and asked to hold Sokolov accountable under administrative law.
Presumably, the same position could also be taken by the Federal Antimonopoly Service.
Antitrust authorities also seem to have asked the prosecutor's office to check the legality of the regional leader's actions.

Currently, packages are provided by the owners of order pickup points.
In case of their absence, a fine is imposed.
Starting from Monday, February 13, packages at Wildberries pickup points will no longer be available for free.
Users of the marketplace received a notification, according to which buyers who need a bag will have to pay for it from 6 to 15 rubles.
This amount will be deducted from the card specified in the personal account.
As stated by the company, this step will help reduce the use of plastic and will contribute to the preservation of nature.
As follows from the appendix to the offer for the provision of parcel delivery services to individuals, the executor, that is, the person who opened the pick-up point, must provide packages free of charge at the customer's request.
At the same time, they must be designed in specific colors and have a stipulated image.
Packages are purchased at the expense of the parcel pickup point owners, if this obligation is not fulfilled, they are fined 10,000 rubles for each violation.
Earlier, Wildberries customers accused the platform of deducting funds from cards, the details of which had previously been removed from their personal account.
As buyers fear, this is associated with great risks to safety.
The support service, in turn, explained that this is provided for by the user agreement.
As it follows from the text, the company has the right to deduct money from the client's remote cards without notification if payments from other sources fail for various reasons.
The company, commenting on the situation, stated that transactions with customers are carried out with the clients' permission, and there can be no leakage of bank card data.
Photos from February 2023.
A beautiful place especially in summer, with mammoth sculptures around and gazebos with barbecues.
There is a small park in the area where you can take a walk with your family.
Large parking lot.
The store is located on the first floor of the Univer City Shopping Center.
Working hours are from 10:00 to 22:00.
In the store, you can have a coffee and snack on fresh pastries.
There is a small parking lot near the shopping center.
Friendly staff!
Delicious coffee, a wide selection of syrups and alternative milk.
The most delicious fresh pastries😍😍😍.
Hearty sandwiches.
Convenient cafeteria area
Came with my daughter to arrange the pension.
They welcomed us warmly, explained everything clearly, scanned the documents, filled out the application, and explained how to schedule subsequent appointments.
Upon entry, the administrator and security greet you in a cultured and respectful manner.
The building is decent, everything is equipped for people - there is a hall, a toilet, although it wouldn't hurt to get another water cooler.
Visited twice, everything was great!
I wish all workers peace, kindness, good luck, and a decent salary during these challenging times for everyone!!!
Simply a magnificent place!
After a long walk on the beach, there's nothing better than sitting by the window with a cup of mulled wine, waiting for a scallop salad (which tastes simply incomparable!!!)
I highly recommend this wonderful place!!!)))
The sweet cashier asked me if I wanted my coffee to go or in the lounge, 200 or 300 ml.
I asked for 300 ml in the hall.
In a couple of minutes, they give me a plastic cup.
I wanted to do ceramics, so I was "in the hall".
They did it to me.
I am asking, why in a glass, and not in a cup.
The girl replies, saying they don't have cups with a volume of 300 ml.
How does a person get their head around that?
Ask whether to have it in-house or to-go, i.e. decide for yourself the method: to pour coffee into a cup or into a disposable cup.
To get the answer - in the hall, i.e. in the cup.
Clarify the volume.
Hear that 300 ml.
To confront a person with the fact that there are no cups of such volume.
Here, they say, is a paper cup, 300 ml.
It's noteworthy that this is the third such case in Zelyonaya Okolitsa in my memory.
It is doubly notable that I was not offered a standard cup so that I could pour the contents of the plastic cup into it and drink coffee the way I want. I had to ask for it myself.
A number of questions arise.
1. Is the Green Outskirts Cafeteria and the Green Outskirts two sides of the same coin or organizations not related to each other at all?
If not connected, understanding appears.
If they are related - why has the food and trade enterprise, known in the city for its service and quality, stooped to the rhetoric of a kiosk at the Kazan station?
Rhetoric because, as I repeat, such an incident is happening to me for the third time.
I don't rule out that it's happening not only to me.
2. Does the cashier have instructions?
I got the impression that she acts on intuition.
I hope I am wrong.
Please outline the actions for your employees in this case, especially if you are trying to use the service.
We really like the circus, we have been going there since our childhood.
I saw the performances with Yuri Nikulin himself.
And now even with children, nephews.
I like the atmosphere in the circus, and the programs as well.
The location of the places is very convenient.
From practically any point, the arena is visible and the backs of those sitting in front of you do not obstruct your view.
The circus is very intimate, family-friendly!
This time we went to the New Year's program.
Got a bit upset.
Many clowns and acrobats.
I would like a room with tricks and more animals.
It's a pity that now you can't take pictures with animals in the lobby.
But apparently there are reasons for this.
Overall, a very pleasant place!!
I wish you prosperity and continue to delight us with your performances!!!
I liked the developer Otdelstroy, they choose good locations for building residential complexes.
They use high-quality materials, which fully justifies the price.
Before purchasing, we were invited to view the complex when there were not even walls yet, so we could see everything in person. Although we had looked at many apartments, no other developer had offered us this.
Russia's favorite ski resort!
The greatest pleasure is the gentle sparse forests, especially when there is a lot of soft snow.
In my opinion, the tracks are somewhat boring and short.
The longest ones are in sector e, it's still more or less there.
But overall, the atmosphere is great, with many different cafes and bars, so a fun skiing mood is guaranteed!
Excellent master Peri!
She did everything as quickly and efficiently as possible, the salon is clean and pleasant.
Good service, friendly staff, there is a cloakroom and water.
Terrible service.
This is the second time I've come to pick up my order at the readiness time indicated in the app, and I've been waiting at the counter for over 30 minutes for my order.
Such a service is unacceptable in business today!
The response from the "care" service is - we are trying.
At the checkout, they didn't even apologize, simply stating - it's not our fault, it's the program.
You couldn't find any way to call and warn, or any other technical means of communication with previously loyal customers.
"Impotents" try, but business must work.
Thank you everyone, let's all disperse.
We will no longer be placing orders with you, let alone recommending you.
A spoiled mood, expecting guests, and the hostess's apologies - not the best sauce for hot rolls.
Ordered a car (Jeep Wrangler Sahara) through an organization.
The car was expected to be received in about 3-3.5 months (as agreed), but in fact it took 4.5 months - the delay was caused by the situation at the border between Lithuania and Belarus (which Lithuania was handling).
In the end, I am very satisfied with the car, thanks to the guys - Dmitry, Stas, Alexander - always in touch, up-to-date information, professional consultations, and decent human attitude.
Thanks again!
Rented a small house for 4 days for 3 people.
The houses are clean, cozy, and warm (even very warm), each house has its own small kitchen with coffee, tea, sugar, spices, sunflower oil, and all the necessary dishes.
There is detergent and a sponge available.
Among the drawbacks, one could mention that there is too little space, and the bathroom has an incredibly small shower.
There is no provision for storing snowboards or skis, and there is hardly any place to dry things. We had to borrow a dryer from the hosts and squeeze it in place of a chair, and put a heater under it.
But overall, it's a decent option in a quiet place.
Stylish, clean, spacious.
The food is delicious, the choice of dishes is sufficient to satisfy any guest's needs.
The prices are reasonable.
There is wine and beer for those who want to drink.
Downtown Moscow, I recommend
A wonderful place with very polite staff, we will definitely come again.
The territory has all the necessary amenities, including parking and billiards.
Rooms with good renovation and all amenities.
A beautiful and aesthetic place, we strolled around during our visit to Kaliningrad.
Really liked it, both Russia in miniature, and Ozerov Park and the landscape.
In winter, there are many natural hills for children to play on.
A very cool shop for tobaccos and hookahs.
We constantly shop here, the prices are low, and the quality is on point!
Very responsive staff, they will guide and answer all your questions.
I highly recommend this store for everyone to visit! ❤️
Location as convenient for someone.
For me personally, it's normal.
Service is quick, unless any of the visitors are being slow.
The recording is convenient.
The staff is attentive, they will guide, direct, and even consult if you come on non-reception days.
In principle, it's fine.
Great guys!
Thank you very much!
Everything was done quickly and efficiently, the prices are reasonable compared to other services.
I thought the remote was for throwing away, but these smart guys fixed everything for me.
Huge thanks to the young guys!
I ordered a bouquet of 21 tulips with delivery in 2 hours for March 8th.
The flowers were delivered in 6 hours in a package, as if they were stolen (barely enough paper to wrap the flowers).
Later, when the flowers were already in the vase, I realized that something was off.
I compared it with the photo on the website and the color turned out to be completely different from what I ordered.
I decided to recount and it turned out that there are an even number of tulips, 20 pieces.
The support in WhatsApp responded to my complaints about the color and quantity of flowers with "apparently the color was mixed up".
The next day I wrote again and was offered a 15% refund.
It seems to me that this is the height of audacity and most likely falls under the definition of fraud.
I have already submitted a statement to the tax office regarding the refusal to issue me a receipt.
Next up are Rospotrebnadzor and the court.
I do not recommend dealing with this organization to anyone.
I have been going to the stylist Samira for over 10 years, for hair coloring and haircuts.
I want to commend the professionalism of the master Samira, she does her job excellently, I am always satisfied with her work.
She always listens carefully to the client's wishes, and the client is always satisfied with the result.
I confidently recommend this master to all relatives and close ones.
All her works are always performed at the highest level!!!
Huge thanks to Master Samir 😍
I visited this gaming club, I can say the prices are excellent, there are many gaming computers, and there are also drinks and food available.
Among the downsides, some keyboards are broken with keys flying off, and if we consider "normal gaming process", the computers perform poorly :(
Therefore, the rating is 4🥸
This place has become our family tradition.
The son goes to his group activities, while mom goes to fitbox in the evening.
The administrators are super attentive, the coaches are professional.
They organize thematic parties for children, monitor cleanliness and exercise equipment.
It's pleasant to walk and engage in activities.
The 6-year-old child already takes a hit well, showing strong physical fitness.
Recommended for children, moms, and dads)
Best masters!
Irina is simply gold!!
The work is done with high quality, attentively, everything is clarified.
You can always have a chat about something with girls!
It was the third time!
I will not regret anything!
Finally, I can grow my hair out after bleaching it!!!
And Vita is also studying color theory.
Therefore, she will soon be able to combine bleach with keratin!
And your hair will say THANK YOU to you🥰🥰
Reception master Elena Polyanskaya is a very responsive master, she explained clearly everything that is included in the regulatory maintenance.
Also, during the repair of my car, all kinds of assistance were provided.
Also, gratitude to the master Valery Ushakov for his attentive and professional execution of work.
He was ready to answer any question.
The work was done with high quality.
The only thing that was confusing when registering for maintenance was the insufficiently clear information about the work schedule. Upon arrival for maintenance, the schedule was explained more clearly.
I want to express my immense gratitude to the staff of the Administration.
A very rare certificate was needed for the guardianship authorities to approve a real estate transaction. The staff were very friendly and helped to issue this certificate, even though they could have refused, as it is not part of their duties.
Thank you very much!
Very warm-hearted people work here.
Wonderful, warm-hearted, polite staff, I didn't regret coming to this hair salon!👍
Master Nahida did a flawless highlighting and haircut, took into account and understood all my wishes, I definitely recommend her to everyone❤️
Really enjoyed the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin.
Renovated for the 800th anniversary, everything inside is stylish and clean.
There are also cafes and toilets for tourists.
Went on a tour, it was great too.
And I definitely recommend the Russian collection of the Nizhny Novgorod Art Museum - an unexpectedly beautiful collection.
We have known Olya for over 3 years and use her services regularly.
During this time, we have seen how Olga has been developing in her favorite field, constantly learning new things and expanding the space for four-legged friends, which only inspires admiration and trust.
We always leave our little dog with a calm soul.
Daily video reports, if necessary, will be picked up/delivered by a pet taxi.
And they will also bring something neat and tasty)
Generally, it's a fairy tale 🥰
Thank you for the care and attentive personal approach to our pets 🐕💜
The Satiated Moose restaurant is located near Medvedkovo metro station.
The restaurant is very cozy!
They cook delicious dishes.
The menu is diverse.
It is advisable to book places in advance before visiting, especially on Fridays!
A lovely well-maintained zoo.
Smaller than Moscow, but just as interesting and convenient.
Visited on a weekday - adult entrance fee is 300₽, student fee is 170₽.
There were few people, we enjoyed a walk and looked at the animals.
The anteater impressed)
By the way, he was not seen in Moscow.
There are a couple of cafes on the territory with reasonable prices, a clean free toilet, and we also saw a phone charging station.
In general, I recommend 👍
Salon at the highest level!!!
I am very satisfied with the services of cosmetologist Natalia Kuznetsova, I only go to her.
I perform various facial cleansings - both machine and manual.
100% satisfied.
Master of his craft👍
She explains everything in detail about the peculiarities of the skin, selected cosmetics that suit my skin type perfectly.
Now I walk around happy and beautiful!!!
Thank you, Natalia!!!
Excellent club with a huge space, swimming pool, sauna, hammam, and great trainers!
Among the downsides is the huge number of retirees in the pool and in the changing area.
It feels like they come to the club as if it's a public bathhouse!
Special emphasis on the women's department.
On weekdays, starting from 7:00 PM, there are a lot of people!
I give it a three, and that's only thanks to the first visit when I got to see the consultant, Timur if I'm not mistaken, but I could be wrong.
He arranged everything quickly, explained all the pros and cons, everything was clear, my son also decided to get a card, but alas, the consultants were busy with their own affairs, clients were waiting, a consultant who didn't care about anything finally approached my son, he went into the negotiation room several times, discussing something cheerfully, in the end, my son left without arranging anything, the consultant said goodbye, well if you don't want to, it's up to you, I was surprised as I was present at this meeting.
A new office, in a new format, everything is comfortable and such an attitude.
It's a pity that the first impression was spoiled, now we visit another branch, and there the attitude towards customers does not depend on the change of employees.
The selection is very large, the quality is good (the fabric is resistant to pilling), the staff knows their assortment, they help in choosing styles.
You can dress both a slim person and a child with non-standard body shape and height.
Located not far from the metro, there is even a small parking lot.
Recommended!
I was there in September, celebrating my birthday.
In principle, I liked everything about the service and the quality of the food: the prices are low, the portions are of average size, so you can get full, or you can order again.
The only complaint - table reservation.
When I placed the order, I provided the number and everything else that was required, after which a bot immediately called to verify the phone.
There is nothing further.
When I arrived at the restaurant, it turned out that the table had not been reserved.
We were lucky that there were free seats and they managed to accommodate us.
Otherwise, in reality, it's a very good restaurant with an excellent "Price/Quality" ratio.
I recommend!
I went for a cleaning last weekend.
This is the first time I've seen such an organized staff, who treated my many questions with utmost care, and advised on what would be best to do for further dental treatment.
I wholeheartedly recommend it, it's the only clinic I know of that doesn't want to rip you off.
A good shopping center.
There's everything!
A wide range of products.
Variety of stores.
You can always find a product to your liking.
From food products to gifts.
I will not set foot in this store again.
We bought a washing machine, said that we are from out of town, so we will transport it ourselves.
The manager in the hall told where to drive up to the warehouse, when asked "will they load?" he said yes. ))
They took it out of the warehouse without a box, when asked why, they replied that this is how everyone loads.
When I insisted, they shoved in two strips of foam plastic, as if that would do!
They refused to load the trailer, claiming it's not their job, saying load it yourself, they only do delivery)))
When I said that I would then refuse the order altogether, they said "do as you wish, we don't care", in the end, one of them condescended to come down the ramp and help my father shove the car into the trailer.
This is the first time I've encountered such rude service.
A good shopping center. Neat and tidy with a large selection of shops and cafes with restaurants.
There is a cinema "Cosmic" and an entertainment children's center "Neverland".
On the ground floor is a large "Lenta" Hypermarket.
Convenient, large parking lot with a convenient location.
A good supermarket for cosmetics, underwear, and home goods.
A diverse assortment, reasonable prices, polite, attentive staff.
Consultants will definitely help with the selection, they will provide consultation.
Everyone will find something necessary for themselves.
A good establishment for spending the evening.
The staff is very good, a pleasant establishment.
I advise everyone to never make a mistake in their choice. The best establishment in Krasnodar where you can relax and everything will be super.
I recommend visiting)
We express our gratitude to Marina Chasovaya, who was our agent in organizing the funeral.
Having arrived at our request, she took upon herself the resolution of all issues related to this difficult and sad event, helped us choose everything necessary, was always in touch and kept us informed about the progress.
Thanks to her, we were able to honor a close person appropriately.
Everything was arranged and clearly organized, as we discussed at our first meeting.
Marina, fully understanding the state her loved ones were in, gave advice on what would be best and simply showed human empathy towards us.
This is a very good specialist in their field.
Thank you for everything.
Flattered by the numerous positive reviews, I turned to "RemStirMash" and they assigned me a specialist named Alexander.
He started the conversation by saying that he is completely free the next day and ready to serve.
Everyone discussed and set the time - 2:00 PM.
The next day came - a morning call from the master stating that he wouldn't be able to come, it's a complicated request (how so? where's the "completely free" then?) and, if he can, he will arrive after 18:00 instead of the scheduled 14:00.
They agreed to meet again the next day.
15 minutes before the scheduled time, another craftsman calls and says that he can come instead of Alexander, but in 2 hours.
What kind of tricks are these?
A day and a half of empty waiting, all planned tasks set aside!
In short, a competent craftsman named Ivan came, fixed the breakdown, for which we thank him.
So don't fall for empty promises and don't waste your time in vain.
The evening observations completely failed to meet expectations.
First, there was a small lecture with unclear material, then we looked through the telescope.
Everything was not very organized, children were climbing to watch several times, adults were crowding and could not let others watch.
The objects we observed through the telescope were the size of a regular star, which can also be viewed without a telescope for free.
The girl answered the questions in a not very accessible way, not understanding that ordinary people do not know many nuances.
It is unclear what the 600 rubles is for.
An amazing place, one of the oldest Mexican restaurants in the city, has been around since the early 2000s.
Cozy atmosphere, always friendly service.
The price is average.
To sit down and eat 2-3 dishes for two (the portions are very large) + a cocktail each, it's about 2500 rubles👌
There are interesting beer cocktails, based on beer and tequila, for example, Macho Borracho is highly recommended to try.
Price is 420 rubles for 0.5 liters.
In general, the restaurant has very delicious food. I don't know about others, but I really liked it. I will definitely recommend my friends to go there)
Great store, I've been buying goods from them for quite a while, since they first opened.
High-quality goods.
I bought a mixer, it's been five years already, and it's still working properly and in good condition.
Therefore, when we did a major renovation in the apartment, we got everything we needed right here.
Excellent refueling!!!
It is very conveniently located, both towards the center and the outskirts of the area, overall convenient)!
The quality of the gas is good, I've been refueling twice a week for over 2 years now, no problems, the price is excellent!!!
Eaglets, according to the map and for cash, do not cheat by volume.
I liked the store!
You can choose any model, at an affordable price, and for any purpose!
Staff, always ready to assist in making a choice.
I bought a laptop for my daughter for her studies, as her laptop broke down.
Helped, picked up, gave a warranty (a month). Thank you! 👍
The sommelier is working.
He helped with the wine selection, because it's difficult to navigate such a large menu on your own.
Working with the interesting, charming sommelier Vasily was a great experience; Moscow needs more people like him.
Eating pike perch is magical, respect to the chef.
The kids' menu is the same as everywhere: pasta, fries, chicken cutlets. Mine ate pizza, it's AMAZING here!
The truffle was appreciated by the adults, while the children preferred ham and mushrooms.
My husband ate smoked ribs - they were amazing, soft, juicy, and aromatic.
The staff is good, all are smiling, friendly.
We liked it.
The brand new WB pickup point is located in a convenient place.
Working hours are from 10:00 to 21:00, without days off and holidays.
Inside the pickup point, there are fitting rooms.
A very good place.
True professionals work here, who are always ready to help.
There is also a group and chat in WhatsApp for informative communication.
Fast issuance.
It's pleasing that you can immediately view and try on the product.
It's great that it's near the house.
Excellent, modern hotel.
The room is spacious, very clean and cozy.
Everything stated in the description is available.
Breakfast is included in the price, with a wide selection of dishes to suit any taste.
Convenient access, private parking near the entrance.
Solid 5.
Wonderful puppet theater.
We often go to various performances.
Today we attended the play "The Frog Princess".
At the moment, this is the best children's performance.
It was very interesting, lots of dolls, special effects.
Even my 14-year-old son, who just went along for the company, said that it was a very good performance.
My husband and I took a 10-day vacation in January 2023.
The vacation was a "5 out of 5", loved everything!
I'll start in order:
On the day of arrival, they called to confirm what time they should expect us, provided information about the cost of the transfer (1400 from the airport), we ordered a taxi (at 23:00 the price was 850 rubles), got there quickly, there was no traffic, and we were let through the barrier without any problems.
The administrative building is nearby, the paperwork was done quickly, in about 15-20 minutes.
There is an elevator in all the buildings - this is a big plus!
The 2-person room is spacious, with warm floors in both the room and the bathroom (without heating), a huge balcony with rattan furniture (a table and two chairs), and panoramic windows (in building 5).
The furniture in the room is decent, there is a ladies' dressing table with a large mirror, the refrigerator is not too small, there is even a freezer.
There are a lot of green plants in building 5.
Everything is clean, they change towels and linens according to your wish, but if you don't ask for a change, they still change them on the 4th day, the linens are of good quality.
The territory is well-maintained, with benches everywhere, clean paths, and beautiful lighting in the evening.
A minibus travels to and from the beach every 30 minutes.
5 minutes to the public transport stop.
In the dining hall, there are friendly guys who always wish you a good day.
The food is decent, but it depends on what you're here for. We were perfectly satisfied with both the selection and quality. There was always fish, chicken, and patties, etc., vegetables as a side dish every day, tasty homemade pastries, more than 4 drinks, grain coffee. Pancakes are always baked for breakfast, it's just that the cheese and sausage are not very good.
The medical staff is very friendly and loyal.
We were also lucky with the weather, there was no rain, the temperature was 11-16 °C, and the sun was shining.
We liked everything, we really relaxed.
There is a desire to come again, specifically in January, when there are few vacationers)).
It's a pity that the swimming pool and the gym complex will not be put into operation.
Thank you to the entire sanatorium staff for their well-coordinated and high-quality work!
We have been going to "Flight" since August.
My daughter turned 4 in September.
She really likes everything, the coach praises her) that's the most important thing.
We go to Valeria Nikolaevna Pleshkova!
I could never have imagined that my daughter is so flexible!
Wandering the streets of Petersburg, my friends and I decided to check out this promising establishment - and we were not disappointed!
The prices are quite affordable, and the incredibly tasty pizza is eaten in the blink of an eye, not even leaving any crusts.
A pleasant atmosphere and charming staff, in short, I recommend :)
It so happened that I ended up in the Tomarovskaya hospital with high blood pressure and a rapid heartbeat.
And I was extremely surprised: cleanliness, order, wet cleaning twice, moreover, window sills, furniture, and doors are wiped down.
The food is dietetic, but excellent!!!
I was surprised that at 7 am they bring tea with a sandwich (bread, butter, cheese), so to speak, a pre-breakfast.
The medical staff is attentive, every single one of them can administer both intramuscular and intravenous injections!!!
While the IV is in place, they will come in and ask about your well-being...
I have had an ultrasound of the heart before, but this is the first time like this (unfortunately, I don't know the doctor's name, a young man).
Special thanks to the attending physician Klavdia Fedorovna Vetokhina!
A true professional: attentive, knowledgeable, provides comprehensive answers to any question; she selected the dosage and medications that normalized both blood pressure and heart rate, something I couldn't achieve after consulting with other doctors.
Huge thanks to the chief physician Olga Vladimirovna Mevshe, who organized the smooth operation of the hospital!!!
Thank you to the medical staff, the janitors, and the cooks!
The impression from visiting the customer service was good.
Met the administrator in the lobby.
Competent and polite specialists promptly and patiently assist clients with all their inquiries.
The specialist assisted in submitting the application and provided explanations for my question.
For a small shop, the selection of goods is quite good.
There are semi-finished products, dairy, vegetables, household chemicals, and various small items.
Operates around the clock, which is very convenient, the staff is always friendly.
It's cool when there is a place in the city where you can go downhill.
T-bar lifts are crowded on weekends, of course, with a 40-second descent and a 5-10 minute wait in line.
But overall, it's cool, immersing in an atmosphere of positivity and winter, even if the roads are dirty and damp.
Turned to the service for the repair of iPhone 11 Pro.
The rear window was broken and the battery needed to be replaced.
I directly contacted the master craftsman Alexander, who explained all the intricacies of the repair and immediately outlined the price range.
Thank you for the repair, everything was done with high quality.
The masters are very pleasant to communicate with, they will show and tell you everything.
However, during the replacement of parts, the camera was touched, and the focus was disrupted.
Immediately reported the arisen problem and received a quick response.
The error was corrected in the shortest possible time, everything is working properly.
This service has good specialists with whom it is pleasant to have a dialogue.
The prices, compared to other services, are acceptable and appealing.
If I need repairs again, I will definitely contact you!
Grand, beautiful, atmospheric.
However, like most historical objects, it is in a condition that requires the close, prompt, and quality attention of restorers.
Therefore, 4 and the majority of these stars are given to the creators, not the keepers.
Excellent LCD
Responsive concierges, garbage is cleaned up, it's clean and beautiful on the premises, close to bus stops, schools, and shops.
20 minutes to the metro by public transport
A nice, cozy place to relax has opened in our area.
There are all the necessary stores.
A vibrant and diverse food court in terms of food.
The tables are arranged in cozy areas.
There is no congestion.
Well, we visited, we tried...
The interior has nothing in common with a cozy Italian cafe...
There is very little space, the tables are rectangular, like in a cafeteria.
Pizza... well, those who haven't tasted anything better will like it. To me, it seemed somewhat bland.
I didn't really like the fact that the waiter was always standing behind you and practically always looking at the face of your interlocutor opposite.
We felt uncomfortable.
Connolly, yes, they are delicious.
We won't come here anymore and I won't recommend it to my friends.
Lena Grosskopf is the best stylist I have ever had for haircuts and colorings.
She does everything very neatly and of high quality, I enjoy going to her, knowing that everything will be done excellently.
I also take my daughter only to Lena.
The atmosphere of the salon is amazing.
Huge thanks!
We broke down on the way from Nizhny, kind people from KatResurs quickly responded and helped!
Respect and prosperity to you, if only there were more good people like you!
And it's clean and nice there in the service!
Came to Sergey Chigrakov's concert.
Excellent concert venue, wonderful sound and atmosphere.
We will definitely come this year for the scheduled concerts.
A peaceful place, a wonderful Georgian restaurant, with live music playing on weekends and holidays!
The staff is pleasant and responsive!
There is a children's room.
Amazing Georgian cuisine!
The highest rating, I adore this place ❤
A park in the city center, very easy to reach.
The park is clean, there is space for both children and adults.
But there has been no sand on the children's playground for a long time, only dust remains.
There is also a fenced football field which, unfortunately, is not very well maintained.
But there are still more advantages in our park.
Spacious hall, clean, clear layout of goods.
There are products that can only be purchased at Perekrestok.
The staff is hospitable.
She never came across bad products.
Frequent promotions and discounts.
It's pleasing that it's close to home.
You can always find a parking spot.
Visited the bar twice, liked everything, polite staff, tasty dishes and most importantly - great music, the DJs know their stuff.
The only disappointment is the lead singer of the band "Ruki Vverh Band" for the second time.
Not only does he sing, to put it mildly, not very well, but he also reads the lyrics of most songs from his phone, which was especially striking when these were songs by the band "Ruki Vverh".
Somehow this is illogical (performing in the Hands Up bar, in the Hands Up Band group).
We rested at the beginning of March.
Good hotel, pleasant rooms.
In honor of the birthday, they gave a room with a view of the Kremlin.
Cleaning in the room every day.
Refilling of water, tea, coffee, shampoo, and towel replacement.
The breakfasts are simply mind-blowing.
There is a mini bar with crazy prices.
If you want to order food from the restaurant to your room, you will have to pay an additional 20% for the service.
The prices at the restaurant are slightly inflated.
Tastes like a solid B+.
The water park was included in the cost of accommodation.
The water park cannot be called the best in Russia.
And the masseur was just amazing.
Everything was wonderful, but the departure was a bit disappointing: neither a goodbye, nor a safe journey.
The employee at the entrance didn't even help to open the door, seeing a woman with a bunch of bags and suitcases.
We need to work on this to maintain the standard.
A great place to hang out with friends and have a steam bath.
A large and comfortable steam room, there is a billiard, an outdoor swimming pool, karaoke.
The food is delicious, the drinks are fresh.
The workshop is top-notch!
In a short period of time, I have already repaired 3 pairs of shoes (2 men's and 1 women's).
Everything is fine.
The quality of work is top-notch.
Special thanks to the master for his careful attitude and quality of work!
Wonderful basketball school!
The son has been going for 5 months and he really enjoys it, he looks forward to each training session with anticipation.
An individual approach to children, interesting activities, a warm and heartfelt atmosphere.
The store is excellent, the staff is decent, I place orders through the internet myself.
Excellent location of the store.
Plus, there are always discounts and promotions, which is also good.
The AV store is good - convenient location, large hall, good assortment.
Special thanks to the staff for their responsiveness!
There is a cafeteria with several tables.
I often visit - everything is satisfactory!
Nice swimming pool!
I am specifically talking about "little frog", our Coach Anastasia Vitalievna is very much liked by the child and is professional!!
The changing rooms are clean, the water is warm, and there are hair dryers!
I love the bakery's muffins, the service, croissants, breakfasts, and coffee are always top-notch.
But alas, not this time, I ordered coffee and a couple of croissants, the girls at the cash register didn't make the coffee until I reminded them, it was undrinkable, it smelled bad and there was an aftertaste of spoiled milk, I decided not to finish it and just left.
Last time, there was a long black hair in my coffee, they replaced it.
Please be more careful, after all, I am a guest returning here, even after such incidents.
Gorgeous eyebrows come this way!
Victoria does an excellent job of adjusting, taking into account all the proportions of the face individually.
Correction with warm wax, which effectively removes all fuzz, and eyebrows look neat for a long time.
The color is selected based on the type of hair and skin, which helps the dye to last longer.
You can't do better!
Thank you so much for organizing my mom's move!
Moving is always a huge stress, but with your company, everything went very smoothly, quickly, and efficiently.
Special thanks to Vadim and Roman!
I will recommend your company to all my acquaintances!
Everything is at the highest level.
We have been treating our teeth at Novodent for the whole family for a long time.
Recently, my 8-year-old son had dental treatment, everything went just great, the child is calm and ready to come again.
You don't have to wait long, there are no queues because appointments are made in advance.
In my opinion, the most delicious shawarma in Tambov can only be found here. I'm not a big fan of shawarma, BUT when I want something a bit naughty, I only come here and nowhere else.
Delicious, fresh meat with lots of filling.
And I don't understand why, but it never flows for me.
Often when you finish eating a shawarma, you don't eat the bottom part because there's a bunch of sauce and water, well, in short, yuck... but not here.
Therefore, guys, you are the best🙂
Good teaching staff.
In the canteen, they always serve fresh food.
Interesting lessons are held at the school museum, various events are conducted throughout the academic year.
Nice store, polite staff, decent assortment.
However, a major downside is that the goods they bring in are apparently being destroyed right in the sales area.
Sometimes there is not enough space to walk between the rows, and it's also not very pleasant when goods are placed directly on the floor, without pallets. But this is more of a comment on the organization, not on a specific store.
A delightful example of Soviet architecture.
Strict magnificence, which is meticulously cared for.
I derived double pleasure from the concert, largely thanks to the atmosphere of the cultural center.
While we were waiting for the start in the lobby, I distinctly felt that I had come to an Event, that this was truly a social outing.
I was looking for a clutch kit for my MB Sprinter.
I stumbled upon this online auto parts store completely by accident.
Called, provided the VIN code, they said wait)
They called back in about 10 minutes, offering several options.
Since the car is for personal and work use, I decided not to skimp and asked to order a good LUK clutch kit.
They called back in another 5 minutes and said that they have good news for you.
If you don't take the whole set of clutch + disc + release bearing, but instead take the LUK set of clutch + disc and a separate LUK release bearing, it will be 2,000 rubles cheaper, which is certainly pleasing.
Having picked up the clutch, he went to the service.
Upon removing the gearbox, it was discovered that a flywheel is also needed, and the sooner, the better.
I already knew where to turn), the manager understood the situation and placed the order without prepayment upon call (just like the first time, I paid upon receipt).
The flywheel was in hands the next day.
The car is satisfied with the new flywheel and clutch, I am pleased that everything arrived quickly, that they were accommodating.
I will definitely recommend and turn to vinkod.shop.
The New Year's party was a great success, but with some nuances.
I had reserved a table for two, but they seated me at a table for four.
But no worries.
It's just strange that they didn't warn.
The cooking is average, the fish was not good at all.
The host with contests made at the school-level PowerPoint, honestly, is not very good.
But as for the music, everything is perfect.
The atmosphere was top-notch.
Everything else seems like nitpicking.
Thank you for the event you organized
I am leaving my review, with words of gratitude to all the staff of maternity hospital number 7 in Chelyabinsk.
Only people who know and love their job work in this institution, doctors and nurses are truly gifted.
In the OB/GYN department, in the maternity ward, and in the postnatal department.
But I would like to express special gratitude to Kotlyarova E.Yu., who is the head of the maternity ward on the 5th floor, and Yarantseva N.V., who is a midwife in the maternity department. Thank you very much for your help during the birth of my daughter, for your kind heart, for your immense professionalism.
Wonderful store.
A large assortment of balls, always quick order processing and delivery.
Professional employees.
Very beautiful bouquets, always arranged with great taste, always fresh flowers.
Visited the establishment on recommendation.
The food was amazing, the entertainment was lacking, the waiters were a bit cheeky, but we were in great company with children and celebrated an important event, we were friendly.
There was no fiery serving of the platter, the children were waiting.
You can confidently go for good cuisine.
