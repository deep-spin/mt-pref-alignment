The July issue is traditionally released during the Moscow Film Festival, and this, of course, is very sad: to proofread pages when the soul longs for Chabrol.
However, we will talk about the Moscow International Film Festival (MMKF) next time (for now, I will just complain that this year the organizers have firmly established an inexplicable belief that the happy owners of purchased tickets are much more important for the festival than accredited guests, a ridiculous and quite offensive principle that no normal film festival in the world would commit), and in this issue, we report on what we saw in Cannes and at "Kinotavr".
The cover of the July issue is adorned with another pleasant face - the main character of Robert Rodriguez's produced film "Predators", and inside the magazine, be sure not to miss the story about Christopher Nolan's "Inception" (by the way, the man who rebooted "Batman..."), the most anticipated film of the summer.
And this time we are also publishing the first part of a fairly detailed guide to the creativity of Alfred Hitchcock, and here there is definitely no need to advertise anything special, and it is clear to everyone that the author of "Suspicion" and "Rope" is our Tatiana Aleshicheva, Boris Gleyzerov, Anna Golovnya, Nick De Semlin, Dan Jolin, Tamara Dondurey, Nikolai Karaev, Denis Korsakov, Maria Kuvshinova, Ivan Kulikov, Will Lawrence, Sergey Mezenov, Sergey Natapov, Ian Nathan, Kim Newman, Zaira Ozova, Nev Pierce, Alexey Prostyakov, Serafima Skibyuk, Adam Smith, Mur Soboleva, Vasily Stepanov, Alexander Strelkov, Olli Richards, Oleg Tishchenkov, Alena Logunova, Chris Hewitt, Olga Shakina, a London-based spy Evelyn Salt, despite her brilliant track record, were suspected of spying for the Russians and decided to catch her at all costs.
Cornered, she will change into the familiar black color and go in search of the truth herself.
Another action movie with Angelina Jolie in the role of a fatal femme fatale promises to further solidify the actress's position in the action genre.
She will be causing one car accident after another, running on walls like in "The Matrix" and throwing strong men in identical strict suits like children.
This is how beauty should save the world.
Here it is, the native, explosive and world-repairing "Fifth Element" that made Milla Jovovich the most beautiful woman in the universe.
Bruce Willis was the most superheroic guy to him, and Gary Oldman - the most stylish and impeccable embodiment of Evil.
And at the same time, all together it turned out to be not a boring American blockbuster about saving humanity, but the most delightful lively carnival.
What Besson did for 13 years between "The Fifth Element" and "Adèle" doesn't want to be remembered.
He, to put it mildly, was not idle, but all this script-producing fuss and rare, forced directorial performances will be forgotten.
And here is "Adele..." - hardly.
When you watch this movie, it seems that for the past 13 years, it was not our Besson in front of us, but some kind of doppelgänger.
And he himself, the real one, lived in a small apartment in Montmartre, sipping wine in a cafe across the street and composing a story about the most charming adventurer.
Retelling the plot (even in general terms), fueling expectations, in this case is more sinful than usual.
Here, the incredible drive is that surprises await you behind every turn or line.
And all of them are pleasant.
Either a girl or a vision
UNUSUAL ADVENTURES OF ADEL
The wildest adventure film of the decade suggests that "The Extraordinary Adventures of Adèle" will start like "Amélie", veer towards "Jurassic Park", continue with "Indiana Jones" and "The Mummy", and end with "Titanic".
The film is based on the first volume of Jacques Tardi's comics about journalist Adèle Blanc-Sec.
Louise Bourguoin has only appeared in three films with Adele.
She became famous for her role in "The Girl from Monaco", for which she was nominated for the Cesar Award.
The director does not chase after the audience with outstretched hand, begging to appreciate special effects, decorations, or tricks, but rather captivates them, like an old-fashioned novelist exclaiming before a great journey to the center of the earth or to the edge of the world: "Forward, my reader, great things await us!"
At the same time, Besson deals with genre cinema, about which he knows absolutely everything, impudently and cheerfully, like a boy who has watched old movies and read Jules Verne.
Manipulating banalities, not denying oneself cynicism and not being afraid to take risks.
Director Luc Besson
Starring: Louise Bourgoin, Mathieu Amalric, Frédéric Bel, Gilles Lellouche
Plot: Strange things were happening in Paris in 1912.
The ancient monster that was awakened to life by an old medium has caused panic in the city.
The police, as well as the famous hunter, a couple of scientists from the Museum of Natural History, and journalist Adel Blanc-Sec, are chasing after a fossilized creature. However, Adel's main concern is not the creature itself, but a medium - she needs to save her sister.
With the same goal, the girl drags a real mummy from Egypt.
COMING OUT ON JULY 22
"Adele..." is a case where parody becomes the pinnacle of the genre itself and is capable of radically changing it, directing it in a new direction.
This was the case with Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, Quentin Tarantino's gangster action films, the mentioned "Indiana Jones" (he was both praised and mocked here), and finally, with the same "Fifth Element".
Besson's style in this film is composed of verbal trickery, clownish acting, and narrative acrobatics (circus terms are quite appropriate - the fusion of two arts here is organic and strong like never before).
A few words need to be said about Adele herself.
In her, an undeservedly forgotten type of adventuress is embodied, who takes not so much by exploiting sexuality, but by pure audacity and courage.
In movies, such girls are usually accompanied by some kind of duty macho or a long-legged romantic.
TEXT: ALEXANDER STRELKOV
Face to face with history
There is only a timid and comical admirer available, who only spins around (his knowledge in zoology is the only useful thing about him).
Therefore, the energetic girl does not waste time on amorous trifles, but happily spends time in the company of ancient corpses, which, by the way, play a key role in the plot.
Trained on numerous genre "cats" and seemingly soured, Luc Besson showed unexpected creative agility, reminding that the boundary between the preferences of bored visitors of mega-malls and high-minded regulars of art-house theaters is easily overcome by films for joyful lunatics.
Playing in an adventure movie without sadness, fear, and reproach.
ROOM OF DEATH
A hermetic horror film with pretensions of psychological depth and political context, Jonathan Liebesman's debut horror film in 2002 was criticized by critics but was liked by the audience and performed well at the box office, and most importantly, caught the attention of producer Michael Bay.
So the young director ended up on a factory that produces new horrors based on old patterns: Bay set a goal to remake the entire horror classics and entrusted Liebesman with the prequel "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (2006).
Critics once again twisted, but the audience liked it again - Libesman worked in the spirit of "new horrors" that focus on excessive physiological violence.
In general, on his example, one can observe how an entire genre is convulsing, trying to invent new ways of influencing the saturated audience: naturalistic bloodshed of splatter films merges with the chase scenes of slashers.
The plot is reminiscent of the "Saw" franchise, but without liters of blood.
Among the prototypes is the debut film "Cube" by Vincenzo Natali. The film was made not by Michael Bay.
So in "The Death Room," Liebesman had to go a different way: instead of mindless slaughter or monotonous running from a maniac, he chose a smarter option - almost without the infamous bloodshed, but with a psychological game and riddles.
Evil doctors here play cat and mouse with their subjects.
And three men in a locked room are trying to develop a survival strategy: to unite as a team or shoot each other?
Playing by the rules and obeying orders from outside?
Or try to break your cage at any cost?
Not only they are being tested, but also a young ambitious employee of the special services, who is being tested for ruthlessness by an experienced professor who has become a master in wild experiments.
Plot: Four volunteers sign up for an easy test for $250.
They are placed in an isolated room and given a stack of sheets with meaningless questions to each.
Then a polite man in a white coat enters the room, introduces himself as a doctor, and shoots one of the subjects in the head.
The survival game begins, closely observed by government agents behind the glass.
Too thoughtful for a horror film, but not enough for a frank art house film.
He can engage in polite conversation and punch someone in the face with a fire extinguisher, but he is unable to resist any skirt.
Charming Nastya, on the contrary, is cautious and inflexible in her sympathies.
She is hurt by her father's courtly way of life and openly spies on him as he, as if parodying the famous scene from Paul Verhoeven's "Showgirls," dives into the pool for another romantic victim.
The daughter rebels, while the father tempts her young chosen one from a poor family with money.
But the main theme of the family conflict is not at all the generation gap or the choice of profession, it is, one way or another, already predetermined, but the girl's unsuccessful attempts to refute the obvious idea that everything is bought and sold in modern Moscow.
The dull melodramatic Mger Mkrtchan, together with Pavel Bardin, directed a comedy with Ivan Urgant called "Three and a Snowflake".
Depardieu convincingly portrayed the father of a growing daughter in the comedy genre.
The intricate plot revolves around the romantic adventures of the characters, who constantly discuss psychology but, apparently, due to a clever directorial idea, focus on the language of gaze and gesture themselves.
Secondary plot branches (the girl who was disfigured in a car accident, whom Alexey wants to marry, the alcoholic athlete played by Sergey Gorobchenko), unfortunately, are only outlined in dashes.
It is especially regrettable the line about the business of buying football players, as well as the one left behind the scenes.
Plot: The fate of his underage daughter Nastya worries the football star agent more than anything else in the world.
The kind-hearted dad changes women like expensive shirts, but his daughter is about to turn eighteen, and she must definitely marry a guy "with a backbone".
What a disappointment it is for a businessman when Nastya, in her struggle for independence and to spite her father, chooses his peer and business partner.
But the author hit the mark with a potential slogan for the film's audience: "Don't look for a problem where there isn't one." Couldn't have said it better.
Their resemblance simply cannot fail to impress.
In both storylines, there are squads of tough guys, lucky soldiers, forced to seek revenge on those who betrayed them, and each company has one beautiful girl.
The heroes jump practically in the same parts of the world (both films start in Latin America and end in the port of Los Angeles) and exploit the same spectacular shots - in both cases, something filled with dollar bills explodes, and a whirlwind of bucks descends on the set.
Even villains dressed in expensive suits are not easy to distinguish from each other (they are played by Patricks in both cases - Jason Patrick here, Patrick Wilson there).
Zoe Saldana's previous role was Neytiri in "Avatar".
Sylvain White used to direct dance battles - "Stomp the Yard".
Chris Evans was recently called to play the hero of other comics: he will be Captain America.
Director Sylvain White was inspired by a comic book series that was released in the 70s and rebooted in the 2000s, and Joe Carnahan - by a comedy series from the 80s.
It's simply amazing how they, without coordinating, brought different material to an absolutely thunderous denominator, making quite heavy, predictable, unnecessary action movies that bring to mind a lot of films with Willis and Schwarzenegger (comparisons always favor Bruce and Arnold).
If we have to choose between these two tapes, then "Losers" looks slightly more attractive and clearly more efficient in terms of performance (after all, the budget is three and a half times smaller).
At least here we have Zoe Saldana, who looks great with a bazooka.
Starring: Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Zoe Saldana, Chris Evans, Patrick Wilson, Idris Elba, Columbus Short
Plot: During an operation in the Bolivian jungle, a group of seasoned commandos working for the CIA was betrayed by their own superiors: a helicopter carrying the children they were trying to rescue was blown up, and the soldiers themselves have been considered dead since that moment.
But they are alive - and determined to take revenge on the scoundrel with a languid voice who orchestrated all of this, no matter what.
All this is cute, but honestly, spending an hour and a half of your life on a White's painting is worth it only if you have absolutely no more interesting options.
Made from recycled materials, a conditionally edible combat ration.
A simple story about a runaway Romanian convict.
In a Romanian low-budget film, which received an award at a prestigious international film festival.
In principle, having only this data at hand, one can vividly imagine the hypothetical content of the painting and even some specific details of its form.
Without any doubt, the movie promises to be socially relevant.
Undoubtedly, it will be realistic, and moreover, harsh.
There is a high probability of the participation of non-professional actors.
Also, the film will feature a lot of Romanian poverty (yes, poverty knows no nationality, but Romanian poverty, as our festival laureates prove from film to film, is particularly poor).
Also, without knowing the year of release, one can easily mistake what is happening on the screen for exercises of some underground critical realists from the countries of the Warsaw Pact, to whom a lecture on Bresson was given in the early 80s.
The film received the Grand Prix of the jury at the Berlin International Film Festival.
The script is based on the play by Andrei Valean, whose work is in high demand among directors of the Romanian "new wave".
Operator Marius Panduru often works with Corneliu Porumboiu.
All that has been said is true for Florin Serban's debut work, and - understand us correctly - it is not at all derogatory, but rather a recommending character: the Romanian "new wave" is in that blissful stage of development when the faith of its representatives in methods.
My work has not been shaken yet.
And this moment must be caught: only thanks to this faith can one endure the one and a half hour spectacle of the Romanian colony for minors and surrender to the charisma of the most talented Pisteranu (whose story, despite the abyss separating two cultures, can easily be)
Convert to exploitation a la 70s, with a cowboy who decided to take a walk from the prison, from where he will soon be released, to the nearest saloon.
Starring: Georg Pistereanu, Ada Condeescu, Mihai Constantin, Clara Voda, Marian Bratu
Plot: After serving his four-year sentence, 18-year-old inmate Silviu (Pistereanu) is soon to be released, but unexpectedly discovers that his mother wants to take his younger brother with her to Italy.
From this moment on, the young man's behavior becomes inappropriate.
The intrigue with social worker Anna further pushes the guy to desperate actions, the meaning of which is exhausted by the title of the film.
What a load of nonsense!
If you want to watch, then watch.
A decent debut that inspires weak hope that a decent direction will eventually emerge from Romanian arthouse cinema.
Cartoon about the joys of villainy and family life
The directorial debut of a person named Grob (Sop) and his co-author Reno is made under the auspices of producer Christopher Meledandri, the gray cardinal of American animation, responsible, in particular, for all the "Ice Age" films, "Horton" and "Robots".
"Despicable Me" is probably the best work of his team: the film is beautifully animated (by the way, it makes sense to watch it in 3D), especially if you like it when different objects constantly try to jump out of the screen into the audience), decently written, and, most importantly, there is not a single vulgar joke here, because of which one had to shamefully sink into the seat and cover children's ears with hands during the "Ice Age" movies.
It is clear that the reason for the change of course was not the authors' sense of measure, but the blatant asexuality of the main character, which in turn is dictated by the unwillingness to touch upon the topic of pedophilia in any way.
The "adult" part here, in addition to the main collision of single fatherhood, is accompanied by quite harsh black humor (which, one would like to think, we owe to director Coffin).
Overall, this is a very charming film - so much so that at some point it even becomes too perfect and correct.
You can feel the painstaking work of a well-coordinated team of marketers who have thought through every detail to make the film appealing to all categories of citizens.
Not that we want to see the heroes of a children's cartoon being eaten by cannibals or destroyed by a nuclear explosion.
Plot: The big-nosed villain Gru, whose childhood dreams of becoming an astronaut have transformed over the years into an idea to steal the Moon, is forced to seek the help of children in order to execute his grand plan and eliminate a young competitor.
In a certain advanced shelter, he adopts three orphan girls - Margo with glasses, Edith with a bonnet, and Agnes, whose cuteness can only be compared to the kitten from "Shrek".
As usual, children immediately transform adults' plans.
The main character is copied from Christopher Meledandri - both of them are bald, have big noses, and have a tendency towards black humor.
In the original, the main characters were voiced by Steve Carell and Jason Segel.
In the final, Gru dances the role of Travolta.
A car approaches the abandoned trailer somewhere in the middle of a hypothetical desert, from which three pairs of very solid breasts emerge.
Exactly so.
The carriers of this gift themselves are not so significant.
The camera confidently captures attention on this part of the body.
For connoisseurs, we immediately announce good news - the entire film is in the same spirit.
Rick Jacobson understands the most correct things about female beauty and conducted a casting in such a way that what is happening on the screen has secondary importance.
And a lot of funny things happen.
"Brokeress", "killeress" and "stripperess" dig in the sand, pour water on themselves (don't ask why), carry some nonsense and periodically fight fiercely.
The creators believe that a foul-mouthed cow with generous curves, covered in mud, with a broken nose and shining white teeth - is cool.
"Stervoznye shtuchki" are primarily focused on classic sexploitation films.
Rick Jacobson directed episodes of "Xena: Warrior Princess" and "The Incredible Journeys of Hercules."
A spiritually close film in Moscow's distribution is "A Gun for Jennifer".
Even cooler is when a bitchy beauty spins a gangster's balls, a crazy punk fights alongside a Japanese schoolgirl, accompanied by a samurai sword and lesbian sex; and the intrigue unfolds through an endless number of flashbacks.
In general, for a cinema fetishist, a real Klondike of pleasures is discovered here.
It is clear, of course, that Jacobsen and his gang had a lot of fun making this trash parody, but the task itself seems quite strange.
If it weren't for the physical attributes of the actresses, it would have become boring by the middle.
It can be assumed that this nonsense came to us from the adult channel (by the way, Jacobsen often takes on serial episodes).
Starring: Julia Voth, Erin Cummings, America Olivo, Michael Hurst, Ron Melendez
Plot: Three dangerous beauties bring the mafia boss to the desert, where he has hidden diamonds worth a substantial amount.
Having achieved nothing and not having shot the unfortunate bandit, the women begin to grab each other, fight with each other and periodically with the frostbitten people who arrive from somewhere, as well as regularly kiss and hug each other.
As the case unfolds, it turns out that all three of them are not who they claimed to be at the beginning.
Apparently, according to the author, it's even more amusing this way.
Product for a narrow circle of fans of monstrous bad taste
Yes, with his latest film "Judgment Day," the watered-down "Mad Max" for the less fortunate, Marshall made a serious misstep.
The bloodthirsty and biting peplum restores the director's shaken trust.
The new non-politically correct and gloomy magnum opus does not shy away from a modest budget, obvious sources of inspiration, and fierce B-movie aesthetics.
There is both a hooligan courage in the film "Warrior Dogs" and animal cruelty in "Descent".
"The Marshall Plan" to clean up the "peplum" from the accumulated post-gladiator film dirt, overall, worked.
In 2011, Kevin MacDonald will present his interpretation of the history of the Ninth Legion.
His legionnaires, covered in battle scars (including unexpectedly colorful David Morrissey and Liam Cunningham), are tough guys trying to marry their military duty with an irresistible desire to survive.
Murder and the intimate details of natural needs in ancient times are depicted here with love and thoroughness.
The scene of the Ninth Legion's extermination, which cost a lot of budget money, is directly inspired by the opening battle in the German forests from the now iconic "Gladiator" by Sir Ridley Scott, but for some reason, there is absolutely no desire to accuse Marshall of plagiarism: he works honestly and without pretensions.
Starring: Michael Fassbender, Olga Kurylenko, Dominic West, Liam Cunningham, David Morrissey
Plot: The lands of modern Scotland, occupied by the Holy Roman Empire.
The remote outpost, where Centurion Quintus Dias (Fassbender) serves, is ruthlessly devastated by a reconnaissance detachment of Picts.
Dias, who miraculously survived, is forced to first join the infamous Ninth Legion, and then, with a handful of other surviving Romans, try to escape from a group of Pictish militants led by the sadistic Itain (Kurylenko).
The delicate arthouse artist has so far managed to win only sharply characterized supporting roles in Hollywood, but one really wants to believe that the situation will change after "Centurion".
Peplum - revised and expanded edition.
Almost like "Gladiator", only more modest and severe.
Continuation of the story about high school student Bella (Kristen Stewart) and her complicated relationships with two extremely promising young people - the pale-faced vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and the werewolf bodybuilder Jacob (Taylor Lautner).
Robert Pattinson's fans held their breath.
Large-scale film adaptation of the animated series about a bald boy-wizard, called upon to bring peace to four kingdoms.
The Fire Lord started a bloody war and subjugated his neighbors.
Young Aang will be able to stop him only if he learns to control all the elements and becomes the Avatar.
Cobb's house (Leonardo DiCaprio) can steal other people's thoughts and works tirelessly in the field of industrial espionage.
Penetrating into the subject's sleep, it makes the sleeping brain work according to its own rules.
But this time he will have to do the opposite - leave in one head what was not there.
Picturesque lesson on managing illusory worlds from Christopher Nolan.
Experienced wizard (Nicholas Cage) finds himself a young assistant in hopes of defeating the evil magician (Alfred Molina) together.
Using destructive spells, they will create chaos in the middle of Manhattan with dragons and explosions.
Bald as a billiard ball, the cat has conceived the idea of conquering the whole world, and now the super-agent dogs are forced to join forces with their meowing antagonists.
Second episode of a fluffy family comedy.
A few hardened thugs led by the frail-looking Royce (Adrien Brody) mysteriously find themselves on another planet, where stylish fanged aliens open up a sport hunting on them.
Return of the iconic character from the 80s to the big screen.
Pay attention to George Clooney, who teamed up with rock photographer-turned-director Anton Corbijn ("Control") for a very intriguing existential exploration of the psychology of an aging hitman hiding from people in a small Italian town and slowly discovering human nature.
"The visionary artist of Corbain's scale and the magnificent George Clooney are a cinematic union forged in heaven," boasts the studio press release.
In addition, this project is another confirmation of the longest love relationship in Clooney's life - with Italy: the filming took place in the picturesque town of Castel del Monte in Abruzzo.
Based on Martin But's novel "A Very Secret Gentleman", Rowan Joffe made some adjustments to his screenplay: the role of the English narrator was replaced by an American, as indicated in the title, and the main character, who was originally an illegal gunsmith, became a simple killer.
In the rest, the story is close to the original: while the killer Jack tries to figure out his last job and finally quit his profitable trade, his icy heart melts under the charm of the local priest (Paolo Bonachelli) and a street prostitute (Tekla Ryuten), whom Cluny's character instantly falls in love with.
"Jack tempts fate," states the official synopsis.
"The dangerous envoy of darkness is getting closer and closer to him, and the mysterious lady who hires him may well turn out to be not who she claims to be."
Judging by the trailer, Corbijn's visual experiments, seasoned with Clooney's ashy mane (the film resembles a long music video 02), have reached a qualitatively new level.
Daniel Radcliffe will play the lead role in the adaptation of Remarque's "All Quiet on the Western Front".
Can I take a picture of you with a camera?
Johnny Depp could be seen in two places at once this season.
First of all, in Venice on the set of the thriller "The Tourist" by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck ("The Lives of Others").
There he plays a tourist in love with the heroine Angelina Jolie.
Secondly, in Puerto Rico, on the set of "The Rum Diary," an adaptation of the debut novel by the legendary Hunter S. Thompson.
The project is directed and written by Bruce Robinson ("Withnail and I"), whose latest directorial work was the thriller "Jennifer 8" in 1992.
Looking at the work of the poster artists of domestic prison drama, one can't even doubt what inspired them.
But you can't approach the question of implementing an idea literally!
However, it is good that the heroine of the Russian film, although a stranger, is not bald at all.
Director Dennis Dugan mainly specializes in projects with Adam Sandler.
They already have four joint projects to their credit: "Lucky Gilmore", "Big Daddy", "Chuck and Larry: Fire Wedding", "Don't Mess with Gohan!"
In July, the fifth comedy "Classmates" is released, and the sixth one "The Pretend Wife" with Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman is in the works.
The schedule also includes a seventh film - the romantic comedy "Jack and Jill", where Sandler will have to play both Jack and his twin sister Jill at the same time.
Matthew Vaughn, who impressed audiences this year with the spectacular action film "Kick-Ass", will be involved in the reboot of the X-Men franchise.
In the movie "X-Men: First Class," the director first called James McAvoy, giving him the role of a young Professor X.
Rosamund Pike will play the mutant telepath Emma Frost, also known as the White Queen, Amber Heard will transform into the blue-skinned Mystique, and Michael Fassbender is expected to become Magneto.
While the filming of the new Bond series is being postponed, its new director Sam Mendes doesn't have time to get bored.
In his to-do list is the musical "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" and the film adaptation of the novel "On the Shore" by Izen MacEwan.
The script is adapted by the author himself.
Carey Mulligan has been offered the lead female role.
Gary Oldman is considering the role of practical Major George Smiley - the main character of John le Carré's series of novels - in the film adaptation of the thriller "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy".
In the first adaptation of this work in 1979, Alec Guinness played.
The new version will be directed by Danish director Tomas Alfredson, the creator of the horror film "Let the Right One In".
Tom Tykwer will adapt the bestselling science fiction novel "Cloud Atlas" by David Mitchell.
According to the director's confession, this is a difficult (in the novel there are six parallel plot lines), but extremely interesting work.
Offers have already been received from him by Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, James McAvoy, Ian McKellen, and Natalie Portman.
In Crimea, the shooting of an international action movie by Maxim Korostyshewsky under the working title "Soldiers of Fortune" is taking place.
It is dedicated to millionaires who have gone to a real war for their own money in search of adrenaline.
Starring Christian Slater, Sean Bean, Ving Rhames, Dominic Monaghan, Oksana Korostyshevskaya, and others.
The film premiere is scheduled for the beginning of 2011.
Sam Rockwell will star in the comedy "Baby Jesus" alongside English pop star Pixie Lott.
Megan Fox was fired from "Transformers 3"
According to the film company Ragatoipe, the dismissal "is not related to the interview in which Fox compared Michael Bay to Hitler."
However, the place of the main heroine and the new love interest of the hero Shia LaBeouf will most likely be taken by English model Rosie Huntington-Whitely.
The girl has no experience in cinema, so she will have to take accelerated acting courses.
This fact should not scare an experienced viewer - there are plenty of examples in the history of cinema of successful requalification of models into actresses.
Charlize Theron ("Monster"), Angelina Jolie ("Interrupted Life"), Jessica Lange ("Blue Sky", "Tootsie"), Kim Basinger ("Secrets of Los Angeles"), Jennifer Connelly ("A Beautiful Mind"), Gina Davis ("The Accidental Tourist"), and "First Vice-Miss USA-86" Halle Berry ("Monster's Ball") started as models or appeared in fashion magazines and eventually received a well-deserved "Oscar".
Successful in acting (also the beauties Milla Jovovich, Cameron Diaz, Monica Bellucci and, what is especially pleasant, our compatriot Olga Kurylenko.
High rewards are clearly within arm's reach for them.
In a word, Rosie has someone to look up to.
Valeria Gai Germanika, who received a Special Mention from the Cannes jury in 2008 for the film "Everyone Will Die But Me" and directed the scandalous TV series "School," has been appointed as the creative director at the TV channel MT.
The channel's management believes that it is Valeria who will be able to bring the desired and necessary changes.
In particular, filming of their own series is already being planned (about teenagers or about vampires).
Germanika also started casting new hosts.
The comedy "Kolotilov" directed by Leo Gabriadze and produced by Timur Bekmambetov unexpectedly turned into "Vykrutasy".
The main theme of the film remains the same - provincial Russian language teacher Slava Kolotilov (Konstantin Khabensky) rushes to Moscow to his bride, but gets delayed in order to train a football team of orphans.
The second plot line of the film has received new development.
Instead of actress Elena Plaksina, the role of the capital bride Nadya will be played by Milla Jovovich.
As an additional intrigue, a third person will appear - Nadya's ex-fiancé Danya (Ivan Urgant).
Thus, in addition to the question of whether the neighborhood team will win the football championship, there is a dilemma of who will get Milla Jovovich.
Due to constant delays in filming "The Hobbit" and the presence of numerous other projects, Guillermo del Toro declined the position of director.
Studios are persuading producer Peter Jackson to take full control of the project, but he is only willing to agree to this step in case of urgent necessity.
Possible successors are named David Yates, who finished shooting the Harry Potter saga, and Neill Blomkamp, whose film "District 9", produced by Jackson, received an Oscar nomination.
Officially, the name of the new director will be announced at the next Sots-Sop convention at the end of July.
Angelina Jolie will play Cleopatra.
Crazed by the intense schedule, critics and cinematographers raced at high speeds between the Sochi Winter Theater, where screenings with master classes were taking place, and the "Zhemchuzhina" hotel, where press conferences and round tables were flowing, barely having time to dive into the Black Sea.
The heroes of the competition films behaved in a manner befitting them - practically in every film someone was running somewhere: the bewildered Asians from "Gastarbeiter" by Yusup Razykov and "Another Sky" by Dmitry Mamuliya were looking for a missing grandson and wife, the fugitive bandit from Yuri Bykov's film "To Live".
The same cops were happily fooled by the detective hero Klim Shipenko in "Who am I?" - which, however, was remembered by the audience more for the presence in the frame of the completely naked Zhanna Friske.
Heroes of the domestic show business appeared and also in a couple of competition films - in the film "Elephant" Sergey Shnurov played a truck driver transporting a circus animal for slaughter, and Evgeny Grishkovets reasoned on favorite topics - female betrayal, male loneliness, the healing power of alcohol - in the film "Satisfaction" for two, where business partners challenged each other to an alcohol duel over a lady.
However, even the business events at "Kinotavr" had a noticeable imprint of the show - there was not a single dull moment.
At a round table dedicated to the fate of Russian arthouse cinema, the chairman of the foundation for the support of domestic cinema, Sergey Tolstikov, started a heated argument with the critics: "Do you even read the articles in the press that I read?" he menacingly asked those gathered.
"I write them," President ERVEZS! Andrey Plakhov replied in confusion.
The scandals did not end there: closer to the end of the festival, the film "Ovsyanki" by Alexey Fedorchenko was suddenly removed from the competition program - it will go to Venice: the selectors of Mostra decided that an additional Russian screening would be a hindrance to them.
Previously, "Kinotavr" did not interfere with giants - films from major festivals were often shown in Sochi: this time, for example, the film "My Happiness" by Sergei Loznitsa participated in the competition, which in spring competed with Nikita Mikhalkov and Virasethakun on the Cote d'Azur.
Nikita Sergeevich visited a film by a former Cannes competitor at "Kinotavr" and stated that he liked it.
To the chairman of the jury, Karen Shakhnazarov, the film by Loznitsa, on the contrary, did not like at all - but under pressure from colleagues, he was forced to give it an award for directing.
The award for the best debut, "Missing Without a Trace," was received by the daughter.
A horrifying film encyclopedia of Russian life: naive, humane, and rational heroes are beaten, robbed, and provoked into monstrous acts without any apparent purpose.
A precisely crafted, cleansing film-experience, directed by a misanthrope with a mathematical education, which calls for only one thing - start thinking.
A debutant with a philosophical education, Mamulia refers to films as quotes from Mamardashvili, avoids any events in the script, and claims that the joy of the viewer lies in the labor of comprehending his inaccessible meditative films.
The most complex film of "Kinotavr" has already been selected for the Karlovy Vary competition - a director's star is born.
Impeccably dressed and well-groomed programmer Leonid reacts to the world with restrained disgust, hiding in the den of a neat bachelor's life.
But a cast-iron woman descends on the house, an unjust hand of punitive authorities descends on the hero's head, and he begins a senseless run through Kafkaesque spaces and situations.
"Sometimes it is useful to work not only with debutants," triumphantly declared producer Sabina Eremeeva from the stage, taking the prize.
Critics thought differently: in their opinion, Sabine simply managed to bring out the "inner debutant" from the veteran of domestic art cinema.
And this is symptomatic - nowadays in our cinema, bison are moving towards the youth.
And quite the opposite.
Documentary film shot in a way that blows your mind even more than a similar fictional one.
The author is interested in both a screwdriver exploring an electric meter and a piece of unsalted butter drifting in a cast-iron skillet - all of this turns the story about an unemployed miner, his rare-toothed lover, and her criminal brother into a real oil canvas.
Winner of the short film contest Nikolay Sokolov tries on the black and white stylistics of the French New Wave on the world of residential areas.
Let the Godardian editing techniques in the story about two schoolchildren, one of whom dreams of making a bomb, and the other of playing Bach backwards, may seem strange, but thanks for the rare attempt to poeticize the surrounding reality.
"Three times a year - on the eve of Victory Day, Russia Day, and City Day - about ten aircraft of the types An-12, Il-18, An-32, and An-24 are sent up into the sky. These aircraft are equipped with meteorological instruments and technical means for influencing clouds, as well as loaded with special environmentally friendly chemicals such as liquid nitrogen, granulated carbon dioxide ("dry ice"), meteorological pyrotechnics with silver iodide, and powdered reagents."
The process looks as follows: airplanes at a distance of 50-100 kilometers from Moscow (depending on the length and power of the rain front) "break up" the clouds heading towards the city with these reagents. The particles of substances condense moisture around themselves.
As a result, precipitation falls earlier than planned, and exactly in the place where the cloud was affected.
Work on a remake of a science fiction film, in which the main role was played by Michael York, has been underway for about ten years.
Recently, the director Karl Rinsh was appointed (he already has a remake of "Creatures from the Black Lagoon" in his schedule), who became famous for his advertising videos.
Previously, the project was associated with the names of Bryan Singer ("X-Men"), James McTeigue ("V for Vendetta"), and Joseph Kosinski ("Tron: Legacy").
According to the plot, the protagonist, who has turned thirty, is forced to flee from a death sentence, as the society of the future executes all citizens upon reaching this age.
Robert Rodriguez has acquired the rights to an 80s rotoscoped fantasy animated film and plans to turn it into a large-scale movie.
The original was the result of the collaboration between director Ralph Bakshi (animated film "The Lord of the Rings", 1976) and fantasy artist Frank Frazetta.
The theme of the cartoon was swords, magic, and a large number of drawn breasts.
In it, the warrior Larn saves Princess Tigra and the entire people from the evil ruler of the ice, Necron.
Rodriguez promises to pay close attention to the creation of non-humans and barbarians on pterodactyls.
George A. Romero will send his zombies on vacation for the time being, as he himself plans to work on a remake of Dario Argento's classic giallo film.
The one who will bring the heroes back to the big screens is none other than Michael Bay - the master of action, explosions, and horror remakes.
The director of the remake will be Damin Chen, who will also adapt the screenplay.
Argento and Romero had already collaborated on "Day of the Dead" and together filmed "Two Evil Eyes" in 1990.
This time Dario is not directly involved in the project, but his brother Claudio is producing the film and writing the screenplay for it.
Jennifer Garner and Nick Nolte will join Russell Brand and Helen Mirren in the remake of the comedy "Arthur".
"I wanted to bring more strength into the female character to reflect the situation in China," says Chen.
- Chinese women nowadays are running major businesses and winning Olympic gold medals.
"Gon Lee embodies this power."
For the second time in a row, you are playing an imaginary character.
Is this a coincidence?
Lawfulness.
I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I am presenting two films here (at "Kinotavr" and the Sochi film market - EMRBE).
And in both, I play the woman of my dreams.
But... the director saw me like this, introduced me like this, and many people probably think that I am like this in real life.
Dream girl.
Your film partner Alexander Yatsenko is completely different from his character.
How did you find a common language? What is it like on the platform?
He is absolutely not what he seems at first glance.
At first, I saw him and thought, "Yeah... it won't be easy for me."
Probably, without human contact, sincere and genuine, we would not have achieved anything.
And this contact happened literally a few minutes after we met.
We are great, I'm not afraid to say it, we have become friends.
I told him about all my fears, about all the experiences, about what I am afraid of, that I am afraid I won't succeed, and asked him for some advice and help, and he gladly gave me this advice and help.
We talked a lot...
I tried to do this because I was very afraid of losing this contact, losing our mutual understanding.
And that's why we watched the whole movie holding hands at the premiere.
How did the filming go in Sevastopol?
Sevastopol is the city where I came for the first time.
I have never had any tours there, neither for vacation nor in my childhood I did not come there.
This city has a special magic, its own character, its own charisma.
And this is a city you want to come back to.
He has his provincial charm.
A place where no one is in a hurry and everyone always manages to be everywhere.
It turns out, it was not difficult for you to pretend to be in love with this city.
In general, you are extremely natural on screen, which many, frankly speaking, did not expect.
How do you work with roles?
Do emotional scenes come easily to you?
You know, I am an amateur actor.
And I am a very trusting person by nature.
If I come and agree to work with a director, then I am essentially entrusting myself into his hands and I want to be a mold from which they will shape.
I perfectly understand that it is easier to see from the outside, and again, I ask for hints and talk to the director, for a very long time, even not me talking to him, but he conducts preliminary conversations with me and explains very clearly and precisely what he needs.
And then, through long hours of rehearsals, we achieve the kind of organicity that you are talking about.
And how was it working with the director of the film, Klim Shipenko?
I enjoyed everyone, the cameraman, the director, the producer, Sasha Yatsenko.
Because I enjoy working with crazy people so much!
I saw the same thing when I worked with Timur Bekmambetov.
He was ready not to sleep, not to eat - and here was exactly the same situation.
Not sleeping, not eating for days - and still, whether thunder or hail.
And if something didn't work out, it was a disaster, and you had to urgently do something to make it work.
In this atmosphere of madness, it is very easy to work.
And it seems to me that when people are so driven to a painful fanaticism about what they do, it cannot fail to succeed because too much energy is expended.
Which scenarios are you refusing?
What are the criteria for selecting the material you will be working with?
I don't want foolishness, silly dialogues, movies that say nothing, that carry nothing.
I don't want to work just to appear on the screen once again.
Do you have any suggestions, projects that you plan to work on in the near future?
There are no specific proposals and plans at the moment.
I am not the person who draws graphs.
The script arrived, it caught my interest, and today this premiere happened.

While we are working on the November issue, there are almost continuous film festivals taking place in Moscow: the American film festival "Amfest", "2toggo", and recently started "2-t-1", followed by the British film festival.
And here's what's interesting: half of my acquaintances constantly discuss who needs to be boycotted and who needs to be supported, based on some - well, excuse me - very vague considerations.
At the same time, when one of these festivals solemnly closes with a terrifying Chu4 projection without English subtitles, no one seems to notice anything.
I least of all want to complain about this, but if you, having bought a ticket for money, stay in the hall watching giant pixels and horizontal figures of actors, then that's exactly what they will show you.
And in the meantime, there are no pixels in our issue: "Tron: Legacy" (a continuation of the classic film about virtual reality), "Let Me In. Saga" (an American remake of a wonderful Swedish film), "Unstoppable" (another approach by Tony Scott to the theme of trains), and a wildly detailed story about the making of films about Conan, the Barbarian, the Destroyer, and the Governor.

SOCIAL NETWORK
The history of the creation of the Facebook network
David Fincher's new film is, first and foremost, a story about paradox.
The painting tells the story of the invention of Facebook, one of the pioneering tools in the field of the internet, which united the whole world, separated five friends, and made its creator - 26-year-old former Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg - the youngest billionaire of the last decade.
Jesse Eisenberg in the leading role is just as magnificent as our conflicted genius, emotionally isolated social outcast with an unpredictable set of motivations and attachments.
Zuckerberg is launching a website for several reasons: partly because of resentment towards the world around him, partly out of sporting interest, and partly simply because it is "cool".
The very idea and its implementation may seem spontaneous and impromptu, but the actual course of events suggests a clear calculation and a well-thought-out business plan.
The strengths of "The Social Network" become evident from the first frames, especially in the scene before the opening credits, where Zuckerberg talks in a bar with his ex-girlfriend Erica (Mara): the sharp, intense dialogues by screenwriter Aaron Sorkin gain strength already here and do not soften until the very end.
The same goes for Fincher's direction: relatively restrained (except for the Winklevoss twins, played by actors who don't resemble each other).
The face of one of them was superimposed on the other using computer graphics.
At the same time as Zuckerberg, Natalie Portman studied at Harvard.
Rooney Mara has been cast in the lead role in David Fincher's next film "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."
Director David Fincher
Starring: Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Rooney Mara, Justin Timberlake, Armie Hammer, Joshua Pence
Plot: Gloomy and introverted Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, having a setback in his personal life, takes on the ambitious task of creating a fundamentally new social network.
As Facebook's popularity grows, relationships with a few companion friends begin to deteriorate and ultimately lead to legal proceedings.
The color palette plays its role: warm, sometimes sunny, even in the darkness it remains cozy, it maneuvers between two intertwined chains of events and two separate legal disputes.
Outside of the continuous flow of discussions in the film, not much actually happens: no deaths, no murders, and all of Zuckerberg's legal troubles are unlikely to even warrant an additional paragraph on his meager Wikipedia page.
What attracted 49-year-old Sorkin and 48-year-old Fincher to this not very generous in detail story?
After watching, there is a persistent feeling that "The Social Network" is a portrait of our time, and understatement in this case is an important artistic technique.
Just about twenty years ago, "Wall Street" was doing roughly the same thing, only on a larger scale - with cosmic egos and big deals.
Now, when the daily solvency has become even higher, policy is no longer implemented at board meetings, but in sandboxes.
Zuckerberg wants to be special, dreams of becoming the center of attention.
Severin (Garfield) is hurt that his best friend has found a new best friend (Timberlake) and now he has no one to play with.
The Winklevoss twins (Hammer and Pence), meanwhile, stomp their feet: who said that the rich, beautiful, and athletic cannot also be intelligent?
(This line particularly amuses Fincher.)
If desired, "The Social Network" could easily turn into a black comedy.
Zuckerberg is obsessed with the idea of popularity and leadership, but what is more prevalent in his work - positive or negative?
And what social consequences will his invention entail?
Is he a scammer?
Or a cunning manipulator?
Fincher and Sorkin will never close the book if there is even the slightest hint of something similar in it.
But here it won't even be necessary: in their version of the story, it doesn't matter at all.
"What is it like to feel beautiful?" - is asked in the song "VaBu Uots'te A Vsp Map" by Tre Veanez, preceding the credits.
The hero does not know.
The film provides the answer.
Zuckerberg is a representative of the lost online generation, which has a weak understanding of beauty and even less - of emotions.
A tastefully made character drama about a high-profile internet-era court case.
In the beginning of the 17th century, when Ivan Susanin lived, surnames of people of humble origin had not yet started to appear properly.
They referred to him as "so-and-so, son of so-and-so".
In other words, patronymics - nicknames based on the father's name were in use.
But sometimes, for example in the case of a father's remarriage, a matronymic was used - a nickname based on the mother's name.
Suzanin is just such a case: "Ivan, son of Suzanna."
Serfs of small landowners indeed went without surnames for a long time - what's the point of having one when you have 20 souls and they are always in plain sight.
But the owners of large estates were forced to give surnames to their peasants.
So, the serf princes Andrei Cherkassky already in the early 18th century had surnames all across the board.
In the 19th century, even small landowners did not keep serfs on their land, but let them go on lease - let them earn a living through a trade and pay the owner.
This peasant was entitled to a passport, where it was necessary to write down the surname.
Regarding the abolition of serfdom in Central Russia, 55% of serfs were released on obrok.
And so, they already had surnames.
Capital forensic experts flew in to investigate the explosion in Novosibirsk.
Forensic experts from the central office and employees of the forensic center arrived in Novosibirsk to assist in the investigation of the gas explosion case at the house on Lineynaya Street, 39, according to NGS.
According to the investigation, the accused, Irina Urbakh and Evgeny Kavun, posing as employees of the fictional organization "Mezhregiongaz", inspected and repaired gas equipment.
They used low-quality spare parts, worked carelessly, and on the contrary, overpriced their services, the agency reports, citing an informed source.
On the eve of the tragedy on Linenaya Street, a man and a woman visited three apartments in building No. 39, where they were replacing stove hoses.
So, in one of the apartments, they replaced the gas hose with a water hose.
Watermelon, however, denies this.
According to him, this is impossible, everything was certified.
As a result of their actions, a gas-air mixture leaked and exploded in one of the apartments.
Two entrances collapsed - one completely, the other partially.
This led to a significant collapse of the building, resulting in the death of 13 people.
Earlier, suspects were arrested in connection with the explosion of a house in Novosibirsk.
The scammers themselves came from Omsk.
In St. Petersburg, it was possible to avoid a coastal flooding.

Specialists were able to prevent the flood thanks to the closure of the dam the day before.
On Friday, the threat of flooding in St. Petersburg sharply increased due to bad weather in the city.
The coastal flooding was successfully prevented thanks to the timely closure of the dam.
A potential flood could have been the 32nd in a row, reports the St. Petersburg publication Neva.Today.
The water level reached 184 centimeters, but thanks to the closure of the gates in the Gulf of Finland, the water remained at 168 centimeters, which is only seven centimeters above the lower threshold of the dangerous flood level (from 161 to 210 centimeters).
The weather conditions were complicated by gusty winds, the speed of which sometimes reached 20-25 meters per second.
Now the dam has been reopened, the water level has dropped, and ships can once again navigate the Gulf of Finland.
It should be noted that ten meteorological stations on the eastern side of the Gulf of Finland monitor the water level situation.
This allows to prevent flooding that may follow after the strengthening of the wind.
In Turkey, 8 people have been arrested in connection with the case of unfinished buildings that collapsed.
In the Turkish province of Şanlıurfa, 8 people have been arrested in connection with the discovered construction defects in buildings that collapsed as a result of an earthquake.
As reported by Armenpress, Habertürk informs about it.
As a result of the earthquake registered in Turkey on February 6, more than 20 thousand people died.
The number of wounded exceeds 80,000.
It is noted that the earthquake is the strongest since 1939.
Following the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.7, hundreds of aftershocks occurred, which were felt not only in 10 provinces of Turkey but also in neighboring Syria.
Pashinyan sent congratulatory messages to the Supreme Leader of Iran and the President of the country.
Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan sent congratulatory messages to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Sayyid Ali Khamenei, and the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ebrahim Raisi, on the occasion of the 44th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.
Armenpress reported this information from the Department of Information and Public Relations of the Office of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia.
In the message to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution of Iran, Sayyid Ali Khamenei, it is stated:
"Your Eminence,
Heartfelt congratulations to you on the 44th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution.
Armenian-Iranian warm and friendly relations with centuries-old roots, rich history, and traditions have special significance for our two countries.
More than three decades have passed since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Republic of Armenia and the Islamic Republic of Iran, and we are witnessing a sustainable and stable bilateral cooperation.
I am confident that the Armenian-Iranian friendly relations, forged in an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust, will continue to achieve even greater accomplishments for the benefit of the peoples of Armenia and Iran.
Taking this opportunity, I wish you good health and many years of life.
In the directed congratulatory message to Ebrahim Raisi, it specifically states: "Your Excellency, accept heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to you and the friendly people of Iran on the occasion of the 44th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution."

I am confident that as a result of joint efforts, we will be able to take interstate cooperation to a new level, the multi-sectoral agenda of which will be even more expanded for the benefit of the well-being of our two friendly nations and the security of our countries.
Emphasizing the importance of our views on establishing and strengthening regional peace and stability, I confirm the official invitation to visit Armenia that was addressed to you during my visit to Tehran last year.
Taking this opportunity, I wish you new achievements, and to the friendly people of Iran - a stable peace.

Video caption: WW2 bomb explosion in Great Yarmouth is caught on camera
In England, in the port city of Great Yarmouth, on Friday, an aerial bomb from World War II exploded, which sappers were trying to defuse.
A powerful explosion was heard for dozens of kilometers, but there were no casualties.
The Norfolk County Police announced that although the explosion was unplanned, none of the military personnel involved in bomb disposal were injured.
"The device detonated shortly after the work to neutralize it began."
Fortunately, the entire staff is intact.
"The authorities have begun assessing the damage," said Norfolk Police Assistant Chief Nick Davison to journalists.
Local residents write on social networks that the explosion shook houses at a distance of 24 km.

Caption for the photo: The explosion happened contrary to the plans of the sappers, but there were no fatalities or injuries.
A 250-kilogram bomb was found during construction work on the banks of the Yar River, at its mouth on the shores of the North Sea, where Great Yarmouth is located.
Before attempting to defuse the bomb, the sappers built a protective sand barrier around it, and a cordon, which did not allow outsiders inside, was set up at a distance of 200 meters.
Explosive experts initially, still on Thursday, attempted to cut off the detonator from the bomb using a robot, but the attempt failed, and then they decided, as the local press writes, to use the technique of "slow burning" of the explosive.
During this burning, an explosion occurred.
During World War II, the Nazis dropped hundreds of thousands of bombs on Britain.
During the eight-month intensive bombing campaign known as the "Blitz" from autumn 1940 to spring 1941, 450,000 bombs were dropped on Britain.
Among Belarusian researchers, women make up almost 40%.
In Belarus, the proportion of women among researchers is 38.9%, according to Alesia Solovei, a research fellow at the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences, as reported by BELTA.
The proportion of women among candidates of sciences and doctors of sciences is also increasing: among candidates of sciences, women make up 41.1%, among doctors of sciences - 21%.
In all fields of science, except for technical ones, the proportion of women has exceeded 50%.
The most feminized field of scientific knowledge is medical sciences, where the proportion of women is 64.4%.
Only in technical sciences do men predominate, women make up 26.7%.
In the National Academy of Sciences, the share of women among researchers is 49.1% - this is higher than the average for the republic as a whole by 10.2%.
Among candidates of science, the proportion of women is 46%, among doctors of science - 20%.
Among the faculty in higher education institutions, more than half are women (57%).
Among the vice-rectors for scientific, educational, and educational work, every third is a woman (31.8%), among the deans - 38.7%, deputy deans - 44.6%, heads of departments - 42.5%.
The majority of women are among senior lecturers and teachers - over 60%.
There is a high proportion of women among associate professors within the departments (55.2%).
According to the republican public opinion monitoring conducted by the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences last year, the majority of Belarusians do not support gender stereotypes about women's abilities in science.
63.5% (56.5% men and 69% women) do not agree with the gender stereotype that "science is a male sphere of activity" to some extent.
More than half of the country's residents do not adhere to the opinion that women are less competent as scientists - 66.1% (59% of men and 71.6% of women).
"The transformation in the mass consciousness of gender perceptions about women's research competence contributes to attracting young women to science, developing their creative potential, and forming a successful role model of a female scientist, including through the transfer of experience and the institution of mentoring," noted Alesya Solovey.
February 11 is annually celebrated as the International Day of Women and Girls in Science.
The holiday is established to involve women and girls in the field of science, encourage the development of women's scientific careers, and recognize women's achievements in science.
According to UNESCO data, women make up 30% of the total number of researchers in the world.
The probability of further increase in the key rate is higher than its decrease.
Such a statement was made by the Chairman of the Central Bank of Russia, Elvira Nabiullina, following the meeting of its Board of Directors on February 10, which decided to maintain this rate at 7.50%.
The head of the regulator, in particular, noted that important changes have recently occurred.
On one hand, the conditions of foreign trade have noticeably worsened - the prices of Russian oil have decreased.
On the other hand, the situation in the economy is developing better than the October forecast.
The shift in demand structure continues: consumption remains restrained, private investments slow down, but budget expenditures are growing.
At the same time, inflationary risks have increased overall.
Therefore, in the current year, the probability of an interest rate increase exceeds the probability of its decrease.
"The feasibility of changing the rate will be determined by the development of the situation," said E. Nabiullina.
In addition to a more pronounced influence of fiscal policy, she noted three risks.
Firstly, rapid increase in consumption in conditions of heightened inflation expectations, in case the factors that restrain consumer activity weaken.
Secondly, there is a growing shortage of labor and a lag in labor productivity growth compared to wage growth.
And there are still risks of further tightening of sanctions restrictions.
Speaking about future decisions of the regulator, the Chairman of the Central Bank of Russia noted that despite the previously noted strengthening of pro-inflationary factors, the inflation forecast for the current year remains at the level of 5 - 7%.
According to her words, this may require a higher trajectory of the key rate than was assumed in October.
In the updated forecast of the Central Bank for this and next year, the ranges for the average key rate have been increased by half a percentage point to 7.0-9.0% per annum for 2023 and 6.5-7.5% per annum for 2024.
"This does not exclude the possibility of a rate reduction this year, but its probability and scale have decreased."
"And, on the contrary, there is an increased likelihood that some rate hike may be needed in order for inflation to reach the target of around 4% by 2024," the head of the Bank of Russia concluded.
The Bank of Russia has approved requirements for the procedure of creating special closed-end mutual funds (PIFs) consisting of blocked foreign securities.
The regulator informs that such securities will be removed from the composition of active retail investment funds.
This will allow to start managing the remaining liquid assets and resume operations with investment shares.
If more than 10% of blocked securities are included in the composition of a retail mutual fund, the management company must allocate them to a separate closed-end mutual fund by September 1, 2023.
Each shareholder will be issued shares of the new fund in the same quantity as their shares in the main fund.
It is also possible to change the status of a retail fund to a closed one.
For funds with less than 10% of blocked securities, the new requirements are not mandatory.
But the management company has the right to allocate blocked assets to a separate closed mutual fund.
In addition, a requirement is introduced to inform shareholders about the consequences of withdrawing blocked securities into a special mutual fund.
In the future, in case of implementation of such securities, management companies are obliged to quarterly pay the owners of investment units no less than 90% of the funds received, according to the statement of the Bank of Russia.
In addition to summarizing the industry's results, experts also provided a forecast for the current year.
According to the Center for Analysis and Expertise of Promsvyazbank, in 2022, passenger turnover in air transport in Russia decreased by 6.3%, and passenger transportation decreased by 14.2%.
The volume of passenger transportation amounted to 95.2 million people, and passenger turnover - 228.0 billion passenger-kilometers.
International passenger transportation amounted to 17.2 million people, which is 26.7% lower than the previous year, while domestic transportation amounted to 78.0 million people (-10.9%).
PSB analysts note that the relative stability of the industry has been influenced by government support programs.
In 2022, a program to stimulate domestic tourism was implemented, for which 38.8 billion rubles were allocated.
Tourists could receive a partial refund for tours with flights prepared by Rostourism.
Several state support programs were also implemented to ensure the availability of air transportation, including subsidizing passenger transportation, developing regional transportation, etc., with a total budget of over 27.5 billion rubles.
In the second quarter of 2022, the government made a decision to allocate an additional 100 billion rubles to airlines and to recapitalize "Aeroflot" with 52.5 billion rubles.
"Despite the sanctions pressure on the Russian aviation industry, as a result of the development of domestic tourism and the opening of new international destinations, as well as the continued subsidization of the industry by the state (with 25.3 billion rubles allocated so far), passenger traffic is expected to increase by 6.4% to 101.2 million people in 2023 (domestic passenger traffic will amount to 91.1 million people), according to our estimates. According to the forecast of the Federal Air Transport Agency, passenger traffic is expected to reach 103.0 million people," analysts at PSB share their predictions.
Terrorist attack in Jerusalem, a 6-year-old child died.
Two people, including a 6-year-old child, became victims of a terrorist attack in Jerusalem: a car at high speed crashed into a bus stop.
Six more people were injured.
The driver of the car was shot dead on the spot.
Later it was revealed that it was a 31-year-old Palestinian from East Jerusalem.
His actions were classified as a terrorist act by law enforcement agencies, the relatives of the terrorist have been detained, and the house has been sealed.
At the same time, according to reports from Israeli media, the attacker had mental health problems and was only discharged from the hospital this week.
Austria is once again tightening control at the border with Hungary after another influx of migrants in recent months.
Officials say that many people are staying at the border in their cars, waiting to cross it to the Austrian side.
Thus, this serves as a signal to the Austrian authorities that they have already gone through the asylum procedure in Hungary.
Based on existing agreements, Austria believes that migrants are obliged to stay in the country where the request was submitted.
At the same time, Austrian authorities consider it wrong to automatically send back to Hungary those who wish to cross the border: many migrants become victims of smugglers and find themselves between two border posts without the right to return to Hungary.
That is why, according to the police, increased control is required.
The decision to tighten checks by Vienna followed the promise of European Union leaders to allocate more funds for cameras, drones, and guard towers to protect the borders of the community.
According to the Frontex agency, last year the number of illegal migrants arriving in the EU and seeking refugee status exceeded the figures of 2016 for the first time and reached over 330,000.
Cargo ship "Progress 83" successfully docked to the ISS
The automatic resupply ship "Progress 83" successfully docked with the International Space Station on Saturday at 3:45 Greenwich Mean Time, completing a two-day orbital flight.
The docking occurred at an altitude of 269 statute miles above the southern part of the Pacific Ocean.
The docking was conducted by the NASA Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas.
In Russia, the docking was controlled by specialists from the Flight Control Center.
From the ISS, the cargo ship was greeted by cosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev, Dmitry Petelin, and Anna Kikina.
The "Progress MS-22" spacecraft delivered over 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS, including 720 kg of refueling fuel, 420 kg of water, and approximately 1,354 kg of dry cargo.
In addition, the ship delivered food for Russian cosmonauts.
"Progress 83" successfully launched from the Russian Baikonur Cosmodrome on Thursday.
At the same time, Roscosmos reported about the depressurization of "Progress MS-21", prepared for undocking from the ISS and subsequent flooding on February 18th.
As clarified by the company's press service, the hatch of the spacecraft was immediately closed: "Progress MS-21" is isolated from the overall volume of the ISS.
The reasons for its depressurization are being investigated.
Also, the Mission Control Center (MCC) reported that the ISS crew is not in any danger: "The temperature regime and pressure on board the station are normal."
The lives and health of the crew are not in danger, they feel good.
"The cases of maternity tourism have increased."
How pregnant Russian women got stuck in Argentina
The Migration Service of Argentina has started suspending and canceling the residency permits of Russians who obtained them through the birth of a child but did not stay to live in the country.
Earlier, the authorities of the republic denied entry to the country for several pregnant Russian women, suspecting that they had arrived with the purpose of "maternity tourism".
On February 11, they were finally allowed into Argentina by court decision.
More details can be found in the article "Gazeta.Ru".
The Migration Service of Argentina has started suspending and canceling the validity of residence permits (permanent residency) for Russians who obtained it through the birth of a child but did not stay to live in the country.
This was reported to the C5N channel by the director of the service, Florencia Cariniano.
"What we are doing is suspending the residency status of those Russians who came to obtain residency because their child is Argentinean, but at the same time, they have spent more time outside (Argentina) than inside the country," she explained.
According to her words, when the question of Argentine citizenship for a Russian citizen is considered in court, the immigration service will provide data that the residence permit was suspended because this person "spent a month in Argentina and never came back again".
Kariniano warned that Russians who obtained a residence permit after the birth of a child and left the country may have it revoked.
Against this background, on February 9, it became known that three pregnant Russian women were "stuck" at the airport in Argentina due to being denied entry into the country.
According to the head of the consular department of the Russian embassy in Argentina, Georgy Polin, the diplomatic mission associates the incident with the possibility that the authorities of the republic may have considered the information provided by the girls upon entry to be incomplete or false.
One of them arrived on February 7, and two more - in the evening of February 8, according to RIA Novosti.
The diplomat emphasized that more pregnant women arrived in Argentina, but specifically these three were issued a prescription to prevent entry into the country.
"They were not allowed into the country in accordance with the migration law, where one of the grounds for refusal of entry is the provision of incomplete, false, distorted information," Polin said.
On Saturday, February 11, the migration service of Argentina, according to a court decision, allowed pregnant citizens of the Russian Federation into the country, said lawyer Christian Rubilar.
"An hour ago, they were all allowed to enter Argentina," - TASS quotes his words.
Rubilar noted that the immigration service changed its decision after the court ruling.
Foreign parents of a child born in Argentina find it easier to obtain the passport of the republic.
It allows for short trips to 171 countries without a visa, including EU countries, the United Kingdom, and Japan, according to RBK.
In early January 2023, The Guardian newspaper wrote about the "boom of birth tourism" to Argentina among Russians.
According to Polina, in 2022, from 2 thousand to 2.5 thousand Russian citizens moved to the republic.
Many of them, noted the diplomat, are Russian women who plan to give birth there.
"In 2023, this number could grow to 10 thousand," he said.
In turn, Kariniano previously claimed that in 2022, about 10.5 thousand Russian citizens arrived in Argentina, and in recent months - more than 5.8 thousand pregnant women.
On February 9, it became known how rental prices for housing in St. Petersburg have changed.
It has decreased by 10%.
At the same time, it is known that rent has become 25% more expensive throughout the country, according to Patrulny Petersburg citing RBK.
The average monthly rent for an apartment in St. Petersburg at the beginning of 2023 was 27,000 rubles.
A one-room apartment cost 25,000 rubles per month, a studio - 22,000 rubles per month, a two-room apartment - 36,000 rubles per month.
Experts believe that this trend may change as early as spring, when many citizens who have been abroad will return home.
The reasons for interrogating women in a foreign country have become known.
The Argentine Migration Service did not allow six pregnant Russian women into the country because the purpose of their visit, as stated by them, turned out to be false.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the Todo Noticias television channel.
For five hours, pregnant women were asked questions about the purpose of their visit.
The majority of them admitted that they came to a foreign country to give birth.
In connection with this, representatives of the country did not allow Russian women to enter Argentina.
As stated in the publication, the migration service has a procedure in place if there are suspicions of "fake" travelers.
So, if it is noticeable that a woman is at 33 weeks of pregnancy, she does not have a return ticket to Russia, and she cannot clearly explain where she will go on vacation, then suspicions immediately arise from the migration service.
Moreover, specialists specify that it is difficult to be a traveler "in such conditions".
The artist's decision to leave the theater was planned.

All the details have long been discussed with the representatives of the theater.
Moreover, everyone knew that the star was not planning to renew the contract.
Filippenko noted that the management went to meet and prepared all the documents.
So, he assures that "he did not let anyone down."
In addition to this, it became known that the artist emigrated from Russia.
He flew to his heiress in Latvia.
Filippenko plans to undergo "long-term treatment" in a foreign country.
As stated in the publication, currently the film actor works in the Moscow theater as a guest actor.

Kirkorov won the lawsuit against the fisherman.
In the lawsuit, the man claimed the illegality of the artist's construction, but he did not attend the hearing.
A fisherman sued the musician Philipp Kirkorov over an allegedly illegally installed pier at his suburban dacha.
This is written by "Piatyi Kanal" (Fifth Channel).
However, the Saratov fisherman was unable to win the case.
The complaint against the singer was considered by the Odintsovo City Court. According to the lawyer, documents and design projects were presented in court, which confirmed the legality of all structures installed on the celebrity's property.
As clarified by the head of the law firm Alexander Dobrovinsky, the construction of the pier left no chances for the plaintiff to go fishing.
The application for the performer was submitted on January 11th.
The celebrity lawyer jokingly said that the man probably planned to catch fish exclusively from the artist's house.
Ironically, Dobrovinsky clarified that he will ask Kirkorov to provide the plaintiff with his balcony for fishing.
He emphasized that from that spot it is possible to cast the fishing rod further.
Sleep specialist named the causes of sleep problems
Sleep specialist Sofia Cherkasova talked about food products and habits that interfere with healthy sleep.
As noted by the specialist, sleep problems often arise due to products containing caffeine.
The speech is primarily about tea, coffee, chocolate, and any desserts containing cocoa.
Their consumption before sleep should be limited, as they not only interfere with falling asleep, but also make sleep "disrupted", thus not allowing the body to fully recover.
According to the doctor, it is better to stop consuming caffeine-containing products 6-8 hours before sleep.
Otherwise, they contribute to reducing the threshold of excitability of the nervous system and as a result, difficulties with falling asleep arise.
Alcohol negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
The doctor specifies that small doses of alcoholic beverages promote relaxation and do not affect sleep.
However, quantities exceeding 36 grams in terms of pure alcohol lead to various sleep disorders, such as shallow sleep and frequent nighttime awakenings.
In addition, to prevent sleep problems, a somnologist recommends avoiding spicy food and large portions.
Large volumes and spicy food contribute to an increase in internal body temperature, which negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
For a healthy sleep, it is necessary not only to observe the external temperature regime: the optimal air temperature is 18-20 degrees - but also the absence of elevated body temperature.
According to Cherkasova, it is not advisable to overindulge in heavy food before sleep, as it will not allow the body to fully recover and rest: it will be forced to expend energy on digestion.
The doctor also reminded that the lack of healthy sleep and accumulated sleep deprivation affect the quality of life and usual activities, so it is extremely important to adhere to a sleep and rest schedule and allow the body to recover.
Bloomberg named the name of Trump's competitor in the upcoming presidential elections: In the world: Politics: INFOX.ru
According to the agency, the main competitor of the former president in the upcoming elections will be Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.
Republican DeSantis has not officially announced his intention to enter the race for the presidential seat, however, Bloomberg sources report that he is already preparing for the primaries.
According to the agency, Desantis' team is already selecting consultants to participate in the presidential elections and conducting preliminary surveys.
As confirmation of this, Bloomberg reports on a planned late February off-site meeting for Republican Party leaders and government representatives.
The agency reports that the Florida governor's team is seeking support among Republican colleagues from Iowa, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and other states. Bloomberg experts named DeSantis as the main potential competitor to Donald Trump.
Experts believe that the current governor of Florida is well-known enough that he does not need to start his election campaign right now, and they also note his ability to raise funds.
Ron DeSantis supported the nomination of Donald Trump for the presidency in 2017, and he may compete against him in the upcoming presidential elections in November 2024.
Donald Trump officially announced his intention to run for the presidency "to make America great again" during a speech in front of his supporters in Florida.
Current President Joe Biden, despite assurances from his team of his intention to participate in the 60th presidential election, stated that he does not have a firm decision on this matter.
In France, hundreds of demonstrations against pension reform will take place on Saturday.
The fourth day of mass protests against pension reform is being organized by French trade unions on Saturday.
Hundreds of demonstrations will take place across the country, according to French media.
After a slight decrease in the number of participants in protest actions last Tuesday compared to the first two "mobilization days," the trade unions hope to bring out a larger number of protesters this time, taking into account those citizens who were unable to participate in the demonstrations on a weekday.
According to the media, law enforcement agencies expect from 600,000 to 800,000 protesters across the country, including 90,000 to 120,000 in Paris.
On February 7, according to the French Ministry of Internal Affairs, 757,000 people took part in protests against the pension reform.
The largest trade union association, the General Confederation of Labor (GCL), announced that there were 2 million protesters.
According to VKT's assessment, 400,000 demonstrators took to the streets in Paris on Tuesday.
The police state that there were 57 thousand of them.
On the previous day of protests, January 31, the number of demonstrators was estimated at 1.27 million people by the police and 2.8 million people according to the trade unions.
The next mass protest actions are planned for February 16th.
As reported, on January 10, French Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne presented a pension reform project developed by the government, which provides for an increase in the retirement age from 62 to 64 years.
It is assumed that the established retirement age threshold will gradually shift from 62 years to 64 by three months per year, and this process will continue until 2030.
The new regime will be applied starting from the generations of French people born in September 1961 or later.
French President Emmanuel Macron stated during the 2022 election campaign his determination to carry out pension reform by the end of his second presidential term.
On February 6, the consideration of the government's pension reform project began in the National Assembly of France.

ASTANA.KAZINFORM - The capital police department urges to be extremely careful on the roads, taking into account the influence of weather conditions, reduced visibility during precipitation, and changes in the grip quality of the road surface in icy conditions.
In the last 24 hours, 181 road accidents have been registered.
This is reported by Kazinform news agency with reference to the press service of the police department of Astana city.
Pedestrians should also pay attention on the road, as their violation of crossing rules often leads to serious consequences.
This year, there were 11 cases of collisions with pedestrians who were crossing the roadway in violation of established requirements, and all 11 pedestrians suffered physical injuries.
Since the beginning of the year, there have been 35 road accidents registered, in which 3 people died and 39 people sustained various degrees of bodily injuries.

Depressurization of "Progress MS-21" occurred on the ISS: February 12, 2023, 00:12.
TASS - KAZINFORM - Roscosmos reported on the depressurization of "Progress MS-21", prepared for undocking from the ISS, according to the KAZINFORM news agency citing TASS.
"The contour of the cargo transport ship "Progress MS-21", the flooding of which is scheduled for February 18, has been depressurized, confirmed by telemetry data received at the Mission Control Center," the press service of Roscosmos reported.
As noted, at the moment he is isolated from the overall volume of the station.
The causes of the incident are being investigated, it did not affect either the docking of the cargo ship "Progress MS-22" or the further flight program of the ISS.
The situation was commented on by Sergei Krikalev, the Executive Director of Roscosmos for manned space programs.
"On the cargo ship, which has been docked to the station for several months, there has been a leakage of coolant from the thermal regulation system."
"The situation is somewhat similar to what happened with our spacecraft ("Soyuz MS-22" - note by TASS) in mid-December," he said, noting that the commission that analyzed the incident with the "Soyuz" came to the conclusion that the leak was caused by a micrometeoroid.
Roscosmos will conduct an analysis to ensure the absence of problems during the next launches.
"We need to conduct a thorough analysis to ensure that this cause does not apply to similar structures in future launches."
"This is the main task that will be facing us now," he said.
According to the executive director, it is necessary to conduct an analysis from the perspective of preparing the ship for launch, the materials that were used, and the technologies that were used in the assembly of the radiator.
The same analysis was conducted in the case of the damaged radiator of the "Soyuz MS-22" spacecraft.
"The most important thing is to make sure that this is not some kind of systematic error," Krikalev added.
The executive director clarified that on Saturday the commission started its work, which will conduct an analysis of all possible causes.
"The ship was intended for undocking and descent from orbit two days before the launch of the Soyuz spacecraft (Soyuz MS-23 - note by TASS), therefore there will be no serious consequences for the crew's actions, for the crew's work... From this point of view, it will not affect the program," Krikalev noted.
The "Progress MS-21" truck was launched from Baikonur on the "Soyuz-2.1a" carrier rocket on October 26th.
Two days later, he docked with the small research module "Poisk" of the Russian segment of the ISS.
The ship delivered over 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS.
NASA named the location of the depressurization "Progress"
The depressurization of the cargo ship "Progress MS-21" on the International Space Station (ISS) occurred in the thermal regulation system.
This was reported by a representative of the American Mission Control Center (MCC) during negotiations with the ISS crew, which were broadcasted by NASA.
According to NASA, the coolant leak from the "Progress" has now stopped.
NASA believes that all the refrigerant has completely leaked out.
"This morning we had a coolant leak from the thermal control system into space, the coolant leak has been stopped," said a representative of the American Mission Control Center (quote from "Interfax").
Earlier, due to depressurization, the "Progress" circuit was isolated.
In "Roscosmos" it was reported that nothing threatens the astronauts.
"Progress MS-22" docked with the ISS today, February 11, and according to the plan, it will be deorbited on February 18.
Coordinator of Strategic Communications at the American National Security Council, John Kirby, refused to announce a possible trip of US President Joe Biden to Ukraine.

Kirby noted that he has "nothing to announce about additional stops on the American leader's trip to Poland."
Yesterday, White House press secretary Karin Jean-Pierre announced Biden's visit to Poland from February 20th to 22nd.
As stated by a representative of the administration, during the trip, the President of the United States will discuss bilateral cooperation with the leadership of Poland, as well as collective efforts to support Ukraine and strengthen NATO's capabilities in the field of deterrence.
Kirby previously stated that Biden will visit Ukraine when the appropriate moment comes, but now is not the time for official visits.
Fitness expert talks about outdoor winter workouts for weight loss
Fitness expert named winter walks as an excellent way to lose weight without intense workouts.
Fitness expert Anthony Eng talked about an effective outdoor interval training for weight loss.
His words are quoted by the portal Eat This, Not That.
A specialist named active walks in winter as an excellent way to lose weight without intense physical exertion, as well as improve the condition of the cardiovascular system and psychological health.
"Walk at a regular pace for the first five to ten minutes to warm up the body and joints."
Then walk as fast as you can for one minute without starting to run.
"One minute - at a normal pace," explains Eng.
Three approaches need to be made.
Next, the specialist advises to do lunges or squats with weights for 15 seconds, after which walk at a comfortable speed for another 45 seconds.
You need to repeat this sequence five times. Then Eng suggests alternating between an active step (two minutes) and a calm one (one minute) three more times.
To finish the walk, you need to walk for five minutes at a calm pace and do a few stretching exercises.
For this workout, you will only need 35 minutes outdoors.
Previously, the master of sports in athletics Maxim Babenko-Kudryavtsev gave advice on choosing equipment for winter runs in a comment to "Lenta.ru".
"You will need thermal underwear, moisture-wicking clothing, special lightweight but warm headwear."
"Running shoes for winter are made of denser materials, have a higher platform, and a sole protector," the athlete explained.

The head of Serpukhov checked the maintenance of the apartment building.
The head of the Serpukhov municipal district, Sergey Nikitenko, made a working tour of the territories.
Together with representatives of management organizations, he inspected the condition of apartment buildings and residential houses.
The addresses from which the most requests from residents were received were put under the strictest control.
- Many comments are quite justified and concern, first and foremost, the cleaning of entrances and the maintenance of common areas.
The residents of Serpukhov themselves do not stand aside and actively fight against the problem of vandalism, especially prevalent in the form of graffiti.
"We will address the issue taking into account the 'Safe Region' cameras," said the head of the municipality, Sergey Nikitenko.
Attention was also drawn to the replacement of mailboxes, light bulbs, installation of wires in boxes, and untimely removal of garbage from container areas.
In the shortest possible time, management companies must solve all the tasks set before them.
Deputy Director General of Russian Railways suggested to the Governor of the Irkutsk region to develop new sales directions.
The Irkutsk region needs to continue exploring alternative sales channels, in addition to the Far East.
This includes both the domestic market and the ports of the Western direction, including the Azov-Black Sea basin.
Deputy Director General of Russian Railways, Alexey Shilo, made this proposal during a meeting with Governor Igor Kobzev, as reported by the regional government on February 10, 2023.
- As practice showed last year, even despite the geographical location of the Irkutsk region, this solution can be extremely effective.
It is important for the logistics services of companies to constantly interact with our "partners" (ports, operators, maritime transport) and find optimal pricing conditions for transporting their products through new schemes, - emphasized Alexey Shilo.
The governor emphasized the importance of stable product shipments. The Irkutsk region is one of the richest regions in Russia in terms of mineral resources and has significant reserves of stone and brown coal.
In the region, about 25 enterprises are engaged in coal mining.
The instability of product shipments for export has a negative impact on the financial and economic activities of coal mining companies.
Igor Kobzev also emphasized that the Irkutsk region is an export-oriented region, therefore it is necessary to increase the size of monthly quotas for the transportation of timber and metallurgical products produced in the region to a level that ensures the stable operation of such enterprises.
- Understanding the importance of the Irkutsk region as an industrial center, we, on our part, will strive to do everything possible to provide support in terms of transportation volumes.

Konstantin Zaitsev held a meeting with the active citizens of the villages of Granovschina and Khomutovo.
On the instructions of the head of the region, Igor Kobzev, today the Chairman of the Government of Priangarye, Konstantin Zaitsev, worked in the villages of Granovshchina and Khomutovo in the Irkutsk district.
In the village of Granovschina, the Prime Minister familiarized himself with the work of the new educational institution - Granovskaya School, which was opened in September 2022.
The facility was built as part of the federal project "Modern School" of the national project "Education".
In eight school blocks there are: classrooms, a cafeteria, a food block, an assembly hall, two sports halls, club rooms, a library, administrative rooms, bathrooms, common recreation areas, a medical block.
240.8 million rubles were allocated from the federal budget for construction, over 512 million rubles - from regional funds, and over 72 million rubles from the municipal education.
In addition, a regional subsidy of 64.2 million rubles was allocated for the purchase of equipment.
After the opening of the school, in addition to the children from the village of Granovschina, the children from the Urikovskaya school, where major repairs were taking place, were also engaged.
Over 100 educators lead the classes, with almost 90 of them being subject teachers.
In 2022, a bus was allocated to the school, purchased by the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation under a federal program.
The major renovation of Khomutovskaya Secondary School No. 2 began in 2022.
The students of the primary grades were assigned to Homutovskaya School No. 1, while the older grades study in the second building of School No. 2.
According to the repair plan, the roof, engineering communications, windows, and related elements will be replaced here, the facade will be repaired, and the interior finishing of the premises will be carried out.

The cost of all the work is over 80 million rubles.
Repair in the final stage, problems with connecting to the power grid - power increase is needed, work is being done with the power supply organization.
In addition, in Granovshchina and Khomutovo, Konstantin Zaitsev held a meeting with citizens, some of whom had illegally sold houses connected to the electrical networks by developers.
It was decided that the network company will organize a personal reception next week for the legal settlement of these issues.
- Very often, the question of stable electricity supply is the main condition when buying a house, because the population is increasingly using electric energy for heating.
Therefore, sellers sometimes illegally connect houses to nearby networks, and this is already a reason for disconnecting the power supply.
Therefore, network companies in the territories where active construction is taking place must pay special attention to this issue, emphasized Konstantin Zaitsev.
Anatoly Prokopyev assessed the effectiveness of measures to support peasant farms in the UOBO.
The head of the UOBO, Anatoly Prokopyev, visited three private farms today in the Ekhirit-Bulagat district.
The head of the private farm in the village of Kapsal, Yulia Madaeva, received a grant for the development of her farm as a beginner farmer in 2014.
One of the main directions of economic activity is the production of livestock products.
The livestock population and gross production of meat and milk increase annually.
Later, thanks to state support, it became possible to participate in and win a grant in the form of subsidies for the development of a family dairy farm in 2019.
Currently, there are about 150 heads of cattle in the farm, 60 of which are cows.
In addition, they also engage in the cultivation of grain crops and sow annual forage crops.
Thanks to the activities of the individual farm enterprise (KFX) of Viktor Katanaev, the area of Kharyashino in the village of Kulunkun has been reclassified as a populated area.
In the farm, they are engaged in breeding and fattening dairy cattle.
In 2014, a grant was received for the development of a family dairy farm with 60 head of cattle.
Currently, there are 150 heads of cattle in the farm.
Also, for many years, they have been engaged in potato cultivation here.
The head of the collective farm enterprise strives to create all the necessary conditions for work and living for the team.
There is now a whole village on the farm.
Anatoly Prokopyev has taken personal control of the issue of building a two-kilometer road from the area of Kharyashino to Ust-Ordynsky.
The main types of activities of the individual farm enterprise Stalin Mogzoeva in the village of Otonkhoy are breeding of large horned cattle and buffaloes.
In 2020, the farm participated in a competitive selection and received a grant "AGROSTARTUP" for the development of a meat-oriented peasant farm.
With these funds, a tractor trailer, two balers, and a mower were purchased.
The head of the farm annually increases the livestock and expands the gross meat production.
In addition, the agricultural farm cultivates annual forage crops on an area of 40 hectares.
In Stalin's plans, Mogzoeva intends to open a fattening area.
According to the results of visiting three farms, the head of the district noted that state support measures are effective, necessary, and needed.
- The government of the Irkutsk region pays great attention to agriculture.
Therefore, state support should not only be maintained, but also increased and enhanced.
We, in turn, must be the guarantor of food security.
"The agricultural producers of the district fulfill this role with honor," emphasized Anatoly Prokopyev.
The crossing at the Armenian-Turkish border has been opened for the first time in decades for the delivery of humanitarian aid.
The Margara-Alydzhan border crossing between Turkey and Armenia has been opened for the first time in thirty years to deliver humanitarian aid to those affected by the earthquake.
This is reported by Turkish and Armenian media.
This same crossing was used to deliver humanitarian aid from Turkey to Armenia after the devastating earthquake of 1988, notes the Turkish agency "Anadolu".
On Saturday, Armenia sent five trucks with 100 tons of food, medicine, water, and other emergency aid packages to the city of Adiyaman in southern Turkey, according to Ankara's special representative in Armenian-Turkish negotiations, Serdar Kılıç.
He expressed gratitude to the Vice-Speaker of the Armenian Parliament Ruben Rubinyan and the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Armenia Vaan Kostanyan.
"I will always remember the help provided by the people of Armenia to alleviate the suffering of our people in the earthquake-affected region," Kyllych wrote on his Twitter page.
The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Armenia, Vaan Unanyan, in turn, reported that trucks with humanitarian aid crossed the border through the Margara Bridge and are heading to the earthquake-affected region.
As reported by Public Radio of Armenia, the car last crossed the Margara Bridge 30 years ago, in 1993.
Since then, the Armenian-Turkish land border has been closed.
The Turkish agency "Anadolu" provides different data and writes that the border crossing point Margara-Alijan was last used for delivering humanitarian aid to Armenia to address the consequences of the devastating earthquake in 1988.
Then aid collected by the Turkish Red Crescent was sent to the disaster zone in Armenia.
Earlier, Armenia sent 27 rescuers to Turkey and another 29 rescuers to the earthquake-affected areas in Syria.
According to the latest data, more than 25,000 people have died in Turkey and Syria from a devastating earthquake that occurred on Monday.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced on February 11th that the number of deaths in Turkey has reached 21,848.
From the Syrian side, it was reported that 3553 people were killed.
The relations between Turkey and Armenia are mainly overshadowed by the fact that Ankara refuses to recognize the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire, as well as supporting Baku during the First and Second Nagorno-Karabakh Wars.
Recently, Yerevan and Ankara have made several attempts to normalize relations.
In 2021, Armenia and Turkey appointed special representatives who met several times in Vienna to discuss normalization issues.
In February 2022, commercial air communication between Yerevan and Istanbul resumed after a two-year break.
In July 2022, Ankara and Yerevan agreed on the possibility of opening the land border for citizens of third countries in the shortest possible time.

"Now it will be possible to cast a bust in the homeland of the hero."
He made a big mistake and for most people he will remain in people's memory not as a football player, but as a football player-offender.
But he is still far from Kokorin.
Because no one has been able to waste their potential like Kokorin.
Mamaev, despite all his talents, was occasionally noticeable.
"I can only wish him good luck and success somewhere else," quotes Metaratings.ru Guberniev.
The last club of the 34-year-old midfielder was "Khimki".
The suburban club did not renew the contract with the midfielder in the summer of 2022.
Previously, Mamaev played for "Torpedo", CSKA, "Krasnodar", and "Rostov".
Mamaev is the champion of Russia, a three-time winner of the Russian Cup, and a two-time winner of the country's Super Cup as part of CSKA.

The tanker with diesel from a previously Russian-flagged vessel was not allowed into the port of Spain.
The maritime command of Tarragona, under the Main Directorate of the Merchant Fleet of the Ministry of Transport of Spain, has prohibited the entry of the vessel Maersk Magellan into the port of the city for unloading diesel fuel, as the cargo comes from the vessel Nobel, which until July 1, 2022, was sailing under the Russian flag, according to the Spanish Ministry of Transport.
"The Maritime Command of Tarragona, under the Main Administration of the Merchant Fleet of the Ministry of Transport, Mobility, and Urban Development, has prohibited the entry of the vessel "Maersk Magellan" under the flag of Singapore into the port of Tarragona for unloading diesel fuel. This is because the cargo it carries originates from the vessel "Nobel" under the Cameroonian flag, which was previously under the Russian flag until July 1, 2022," the ministry statement said.
The measure was taken in accordance with the legislation of the European Union, which prohibits access for any vessel registered under the Russian flag from April 16, 2022, or having changed its flag after February 24, 2022.
The ministry clarified that the inspection was conducted on February 9, after which the ban was approved.
The ministry reminded that this is not the first case when ships are prohibited from entering Spanish ports.
In April 2022, the vessel Black Star under the Maltese flag was denied access to the port of Barcelona. The vessel was carrying cargo from a Russian-flagged ship.
In 2022, after the strengthening of anti-Russian sanctions by the EU, the US and the UK imposed restrictions on the supply of Russian petroleum products, and then decided to limit fuel prices.

The problems that have arisen for pregnant Russian women entering Argentina have been explained.
According to an expert's assessment, against the backdrop of an influx of people wanting to give birth in Argentina, the country's authorities have started to pay closer attention to the entry of foreign citizens into their territory.
Difficulties with the entry of pregnant Russian women into Argentina are related to the fact that the authorities of the country are not interested in a mass influx of foreigners who want to obtain citizenship for their children and residency permits for themselves, and then leave.
This is reported by "Lenta.ru" with reference to Professor Viktor Heyfets from St. Petersburg State University, editor-in-chief of the magazine "Latin America".
According to him, no country supports such a practice.
He noted that in Argentina they do not approve of turning the country into a transshipment point rather than a final destination.
This applies to those who violate constitutional practice.
As explained by the expert, the child will retain Argentine citizenship, but the decision to grant an Argentine passport to the parents after obtaining a residence permit will be made by the court.
In case it is found out that they actually did not live in Argentina and immediately left, they may be denied citizenship.
This applies not only to Russians, but also to citizens of other countries.
Recently, as indicated by a specialist, maternity tours to Argentina are particularly popular among Russians and Ukrainians.
Reminder, Argentina grants citizenship by "right of soil", meaning if a person is born on its territory.
The Argentine passport allows for visa-free visits to 170 countries, including EU member states and the United Kingdom.
Earlier it was reported that Argentina has started revoking permanent residency permits for Russians who obtained the document through the birth of a child but left the country.
Buenos Aires is interested in reducing such cases.
It has also become known that six pregnant Russian citizens have been denied entry to Argentina due to suspicion of providing false information about the reasons for their trip.
In Russia, the opening of hundreds of new fitness clubs is predicted.
In Russia, citizens' interest in fitness services is growing, which allows market participants to expand their business.
In the current year, over 400 new facilities may open in the country, predominantly small-format.
In Russia, about 400 new fitness clubs may open, their total number may increase by 5 percent.
According to "Kommersant", several dozen players may leave the Russian market.
By the end of the year, there will be approximately 8,600 clubs in Russia.
According to the publication, the majority of new clubs are small-scale projects with small initial investments and quick payback.
Such data is provided by representatives of the National Fitness Community.
President of the Association of Fitness Industry Operators, Olga Kiseleva, noted in an interview with the publication that 340-420 new fitness clubs will be small, while the rest will occupy an area of over 500 square meters.
President of the NFS Elena Silina noted that since 2020, every year there have been more club closures than openings.
Over the past three years, their number has decreased by 37 percent.
At the same time, independent analysts provide different figures.
According to "Kontur.Focus", over the past three years, the number of organizations with the main type of activity as "fitness center" has increased by 10.1 percent, and now there are 5.12 thousand of them.
The industry suffered significant losses due to the pandemic, however, it began to recover as early as 2021.
According to 2GIS data, there are 4,500 fitness clubs in Russian cities with a population of over one million.
Russians have started paying more attention to physical activity, as evidenced by the increase in attendance at fitness clubs.
According to the results of January 2023, attendance increased by 9.3 percent year on year.
As Silina noted, if the trend can be maintained, by the end of the year the industry will return to pre-crisis levels.
The management company from Kirov had its license revoked.
The Arbitration Court of the Kirov Region has revoked the license for conducting entrepreneurial activities in the management of apartment buildings issued to the management company "Zabota".
In the Kirov region, the license for conducting entrepreneurial activities for the management of apartment buildings previously issued to the management company "Zabota" has been revoked by the decision of the regional Arbitration Court.
According to the regional State Housing Inspectorate, the court decision was made back in November 2022, however, it only came into legal force in February 2023.
The Arbitration Court revoked the license of "Upravlyayka" for repeatedly ignoring the orders of the State Housing Inspection in the organization.
Currently, all objects that were under the management of "Zabota" have been excluded from the registry of licenses for conducting entrepreneurial activities in the management of apartment buildings.
Their total area was 64.8 thousand square meters.
All houses are located in the regional center.
The administration of Kirov is aware that they have been left without a management company.
In accordance with the requirements of Russian legislation, the State Housing Inspectorate informed the city hall about the current situation.
To remind, in January 2023, the governor of the Kirov region, Alexander Sokolov, set a task for the employees of the State Housing Inspectorate to liquidate 2/3 of the management companies in the region by spring, as there are too many of them.
The legality of the governor's demands raised doubts among the Kirov communists.
They turned to the regional prosecutor's office and asked to hold Sokolov accountable for administrative responsibility.
Presumably, the same position could have been taken by the Federal Antimonopoly Service.
Antimonopoly officials allegedly also asked the prosecutor's office to investigate the legality of the actions of the regional leader.

Marketplace users received a notification stating that buyers who need a package will have to pay for it from 6 to 15 rubles.
This amount will be debited from the card specified in the personal account.
As indicated by the company, this measure will help reduce the use of plastic and contribute to nature conservation.
As stated in the appendix to the offer for the provision of delivery services to individuals, the performer, that is, the person who opened the pick-up point, must provide packages free of charge upon the client's request.
They should be decorated in certain colors and have a specified image.
Packages are purchased at the expense of the PVZ owners, if this obligation is not fulfilled, a fine of 10,000 rubles is imposed on them for each violation.
Earlier, Wildberries customers accused the platform of deducting money from cards whose data had previously been deleted from their personal accounts.
As buyers fear, this is associated with significant security risks.
In customer support, they explained that this is provided for in the user agreement.
As stated in it, the company has the right to deduct money from remote cards without notifying the client if payment from other sources fails for various reasons.
In the company, commenting on the situation, they stated that settlements with customers are carried out with the clients' permission, and there can be no leakage of bank card data.
Photos from February 2023.
Beautiful place, especially in the summer, with sculptures of mammoths and gazebos with barbecue grills around.
There is a small park on the territory where you can take a walk with your family.
Large parking lot.
The store is located on the first floor of the Univer City shopping center.
Working hours from 10:00 AM to 10:00 PM.
In the store, you can have a cup of coffee and have a snack with fresh pastries.
There is a small parking lot near the shopping center.
Friendly staff!
Delicious coffee, a wide selection of syrups and alternative milk.
Delicious fresh pastries 😍😍😍.
Hearty sandwiches.
Convenient cafeteria area
They came with their daughter to apply for a pension.
They received us warmly, explained everything clearly, scanned the documents, processed the application, and told us how to schedule future appointments.
Upon entering, the administrator and security greet in a cultured and respectful manner.
The building is decent, everything is equipped for people - there is a hall, a toilet, although it wouldn't hurt to buy another water cooler.
We came twice, everything was great!
To all workers, I wish peace, kindness, luck, and a decent salary in this difficult time for everyone!
Simply magnificent place!
After a long walk on the beach, there is nothing better than sitting by the window with a cup of mulled wine, waiting for a salad with scallops (which is simply incomparable in taste!!!)
I highly recommend this wonderful place!!!)))
The sweet cashier asked me if I wanted my coffee to be made for me to take away or to drink in the hall, 200 or 300 ml.
I asked for 300 ml in the hall.
After a couple of minutes, they give me a plastic cup.
I wanted to work with ceramics, so I was "in the hall".
They did it to me.
I ask why in a glass, not in a cup.
The girl responds, saying that they don't have any cups with a volume of 300 ml.
Here's how it fits in a person's mind?
To ask oneself or in the hall, i.e. to determine the technology for oneself: pour coffee into a cup or into a disposable cup.
To get an answer - in the hall, i.e. in the cup.
Specify the volume.
Hear that it's 300 ml.
To confront someone with the fact that there are no cups of such volume.
Here, they say, is a paper cup, 300 ml.
It is noteworthy that this is the third such case in Green Outskirts in my memory.
It is doubly remarkable that I was not offered a standard cup so that I could pour the contents of the plastic cup into it and drink coffee the way I wanted. I asked for it myself.
A number of questions arise.
1. Is the Green Outskirts Cafeteria and the Green Outskirts two sides of the same coin or are they completely unrelated organizations?
If not connected, understanding arises.
If they are related, why did a food and trade enterprise known in the city for its service and quality stoop to the rhetoric of a stall at Kazansky railway station?
Rhetoric, because a similar case, I repeat, has happened to me for the third time.
I do not exclude that it is happening not only to me.
2. Does the cashier have instructions?
I got the impression that she acts on instinct.
I hope I am wrong.
Please outline the actions for your employees in this case, if you are trying to provide a service.
We really like the circus, we have been going there since our childhood.
I saw the license plates with Nikulin himself, Yu.
And now even with children, nephews.
I like the atmosphere in the circus, and the shows too.
The location of the places is very convenient.
Practically from any point, the arena is visible and the backs of those sitting in front of you do not bother you.
The circus is very intimate, family-friendly!
This time we went to the New Year's program.
We were a little disappointed.
Many clowns and acrobats.
I would like a room with tricks and more animals.
It's a pity that now it is not allowed to take pictures with animals in the lobby.
But apparently there are reasons for this.
And overall a very pleasant place!!
I wish you prosperity and to delight us with your performances!
Liked the developer Otdelstroy, chooses good locations for building residential complexes.
They use high-quality materials, which fully justifies the price.
Before buying, we were invited to see the complex, even when there were no walls yet, so that we could see everything in person, although we have considered many apartments and no developer has offered us this.
Beloved ski resort of Russia!
The greatest pleasure is gentle sparse forests, especially when there is a lot of soft snow.
And as for the tracks, in my opinion, they are a bit boring and short.
The longest ones are in sector e, there are still more or less.
But overall, a great atmosphere, lots of different cafes and bars, so a fun skiing mood is guaranteed!
Excellent master Peri!
I did everything as quickly and efficiently as possible, the salon is clean and pleasant.
Good service, friendly staff, there is a cloakroom and water.
Terrible service.
I come for my order for the second time already by the time it is ready, which is indicated in the application, and I wait at the window sill for more than 30 minutes for my order.
Today, such a service is unacceptable in business!
Response from the "care" service - we are trying.
At the cash register, even without apologies, simply - we are not to blame, it's the program.
You did not find any other technical means of communication with previously loyal customers, nor did you call to warn them.
"Trying" impotent people, while business must keep working.
Thank you all, everyone is dispersing.
We will not order from you anymore and certainly will not recommend you.
A bad mood, anticipation of guests, apologies from the hostess - not the best sauce for hot rolls.
Ordered a car (Jeep Wrangler Sahara) through an organization.
I was supposed to receive the car in 3-3.5 months (as agreed), but in fact it took 4.5 months - the delay was caused by the situation at the border between Lithuania and Belarus (Lithuania was enforcing).
In the end, I am very satisfied with the car, thanks to the guys - Dmitry, Stas, Alexander - always in touch, up-to-date information, professional advice, and a normal human attitude.
Thank you once again!
We rented a house for 4 days for 3 people.
In the houses it is clean, cozy, warm (even very warm), there is a small kitchen with coffee, tea, sugar, spices, sunflower oil, all necessary utensils.
Available cleaning agent and sponge.
From the disadvantages, one can highlight the fact that there is too little space, and the shower in the bathroom is terribly small.
There are no designated places for storing snowboards or skis, and there is nowhere in particular to dry things, so we had to borrow a dryer from the owners and squeeze it in instead of a chair, and place a heater underneath it.
In general, it is a good option in a peaceful place.
Stylish, clean, spacious.
The food is delicious, and there is a sufficient variety of dishes to satisfy any guest's needs.
Prices are reasonable.
There is wine and beer for those who want to drink.
Center of Moscow, I recommend
Wonderful place with very polite staff, we will definitely come again.
On the territory, there are all necessary amenities, including parking and billiards.
Rooms with good renovation and all amenities.
Beautiful and aesthetic place, we walked around during our visit to Kaliningrad.
I really liked it, both Russia in miniature, Ozery Park, and the landscape.
In winter, there are many natural slides for children to enjoy.
Very cool tobacco and hookah shop)
We constantly shop here, the prices are low, and the quality is on par!
Very responsive staff, will help and answer all the questions you have.
I recommend this store to everyone for visiting! ❤️
Location as convenient for everyone.
For me personally, it's normal.
They serve quickly, if none of the visitors are being stupid.
It is convenient to make an appointment.
The staff is attentive, they will help, guide, and advise even if you come on non-reception days.
In principle, it's fine.
Great guys!
Thank you very much!
Everything was done quickly and efficiently, the prices are reasonable compared to other services.
I thought the remote control was useless, but they are such clever ones, they did everything for me.
Huge thanks to the young guys!
Ordered a bouquet of 21 tulips with 2-hour delivery for March 8th.
Flowers were delivered in packaging after 6 hours, as if they were stolen (there is barely enough paper to wrap the flowers).
Then, when the flowers were already in the vase, I realized that something was wrong.
I compared it with the photo on the website and the color turned out to be completely different from what I ordered.
I decided to recount and it turned out that there are an even number of tulips, 20 pieces.
Support in WhatsApp responded to my complaints about the color and quantity of flowers with "apparently they mixed up the color".
The next day I wrote again and was offered a 15% refund.
I think this is the ultimate degree of audacity and most likely falls under the definition of fraud.
I have already submitted a statement to the tax office regarding the fact that they refused to issue me a receipt.
Next in line is Rospotrebnadzor and the court.
I do not recommend anyone to get involved with this organization.
I have been going to the hairdresser Samir for over 10 years for coloring and haircuts.
I want to cancel the Professionalism of Master Samira, she does her job perfectly, I am always satisfied with her work.
She always attentively listens to the client's wishes, and the client always remains satisfied with the result.
I confidently recommend this master to all relatives and close ones.
All of her work is always done at the highest level !!!
Thank you so much, Master Samir 😍
Hello, I have been to this gaming club, I can say that the prices are excellent, there are many gaming computers, and there are also drinks and food available.
Some keyboards have the downside of having buttons that fly off when they are broken. If we talk about "regular gaming process," then computers do not perform well :(
Therefore, the rating is 4🥸
This place has become our family tradition)
The son goes to his group classes, and the mom does fitbox in the evening.
The administrators are super attentive, the trainers are professional.
They organize themed parties for children, monitor cleanliness and exercise equipment.
It is pleasant to walk and engage in activities.
The 6-year-old child can already take a hit well, strong physical training.
Recommended for children, moms, and dads)
The best masters!
Irina is simply gold!!
The work is done with quality, care, and attention to detail.
You can always chat with girls about anything!
Third time I went!
I will never regret anything!
Finally, I can grow my hair back after bleaching it!
And Vita also studies coloristics.
Therefore, she will soon be able to combine blonde with keratin!
And your hair will thank you🥰🥰
Master-receptionist Elena Polyanskaya is a very responsive master, she explained clearly everything that is included in the scheduled maintenance.
Also, during the repair of my car, she provided all kinds of assistance.
And also thanks to master Valery Ushakov for attentive and professional execution of works.
I was ready to answer any question.
The work has been done with quality.
The only thing that confused me during the appointment for maintenance was the insufficiently accurate information about the work regulations. When I arrived for the maintenance, the regulations were explained more clearly.
I want to express my immense gratitude to the employees of the Administration.
I needed a very rare certificate for the guardianship authorities in order to approve a real estate transaction. The employees kindly welcomed me and helped me to obtain this certificate, even though they could have refused, as it is not part of their duties.
Thank you very much!
Here work very kind-hearted people.
Wonderful, warm-hearted, polite employees, I'm glad I came to this hair salon! 👍
Master Nahida did a flawless highlighting, haircut, took into account and understood all my wishes, I definitely recommend her to everyone ❤️
I really liked the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin.
Restored for the 800th anniversary, inside everything is stylish and clean.
There are both cafes and toilets for tourists.
I went on a tour, it was great too.
And I highly recommend the Russian collection of the Nizhny Novgorod Art Museum - unexpectedly beautiful collection.
I have known Olya for over 3 years and we regularly use her services.
During this time, we have seen how Olya develops in her favorite activity, constantly learns something new, and expands the space for four-legged creatures, which only evokes admiration and trust.
We always leave our little dog with a calm soul.
Daily video reports, if necessary, will be picked up/taken away by a zoo taxi.
And they will also bring something clean and tasty)
It's a fairy tale overall 🥰
Thank you for the care and attentive personal attitude towards our pets 🐕💜
The restaurant Syty Los is located near Medvedkovo metro station.
The restaurant is very cozy!
They cook delicious dishes.
The menu is diverse.
It is advisable to book seats in advance before visiting, especially on Fridays!
Lovely well-kept zoo.
Smaller than Moscow, but just as interesting and convenient.
On weekdays, the adult entrance fee was 300₽, and for students it was 170.
There were few people, they enjoyed walking and looking at the animals.
Anteater impressed)
In Moscow, by the way, they didn't see him.
On the territory, there are a couple of cafes with reasonable prices, a clean and free toilet, and we also saw a phone charging station.
In general, I recommend it 👍
Salon at the highest level!!!
I am very satisfied with the services of cosmetologist Natalia Kuznetsova, I only go to her.
I perform various facial cleansings - both using equipment and manual methods.
Satisfied 100%.
Master of his craft👍
Everything tells in detail about the peculiarities of the skin, picked up cosmetics that care for my skin type, just perfectly.
Now I walk happy and beautiful!!!
Thank you Natalia!!!
Excellent club with a huge space, pool, sauna, hammam, and excellent trainers!
One of the downsides is the large number of pensioners in the pool and in the changing room area.
It feels like they come to the club as if it were a public bathhouse!
Special emphasis on the women's department.
On weekdays, starting from 19:00, there are a lot of people!
I give it a three only thanks to the first visit when I met with a consultant, if I'm not mistaken, Timur, but I could be wrong.
He processed everything quickly, explained all the pros and cons, made everything clear. My son also decided to apply for a card, but unfortunately the consultants were busy with their own affairs and the clients were waiting. Eventually, a consultant approached my son, who seemed to know everything perfectly. They went to a meeting room several times, discussing something cheerfully. In the end, my son left without completing anything. As a parting remark, the consultant said, "Well, if you don't want to, it's up to you." Since I was present at this meeting, I was surprised.
New office, in a new format, everything is comfortable and such an attitude.
It's a pity that the first impression was crossed out, now we visit another branch, and there the attitude towards clients does not depend on the change of employees.
The selection is very large, the quality is good (the fabric is resistant to pilling), the staff knows their range, they help in choosing styles.
You can dress both a slim person and a child with a non-standard figure and height.
Located near the metro, there is even a small parking lot.
Recommended!
I was in September, celebrating my birthday.
In principle, everything was liked in terms of service and food quality: prices are low, portions are of medium size, so you can eat enough or order again.
The only complaint is the reservation of the table.
When I placed the order, I provided the number and everything that was required, after which the bot immediately called to verify the phone.
There is nothing more beyond.
When I arrived at the restaurant, it turned out that the table was not reserved.
We were lucky that there were available seats and they were able to accommodate us.
In fact, it is a very good restaurant with an excellent "Price/Quality" ratio.
I recommend it!
Went for a cleaning in the recent weekend.
For the first time, I see such an organized staff who treated my many questions with the utmost care, and advised on how to best proceed with further dental treatment.
I highly recommend, the only clinic where they don't want to rip you off as far as I can remember.
Good shopping center.
There is everything!
Large assortment of goods.
Variety of shops.
You can always find a product to your liking.
From food products to gifts.
No more stepping foot in this store.
We bought a washing machine, they said that it is outside the city, so we will take it ourselves.
The manager in the hall said where to drive to the warehouse, and when asked "will they load it?" he said yes.))
They took it out of the warehouse without a box, when asked why? They said that's how everything is loaded.
When she insisted, they inserted two strips of foam plastic, as if it would be enough!
They refused to load it into the trailer, saying it's not their job, load it yourself, they only do the delivery)))
When I said that I would refuse the order altogether, they said "as you wish, we don't care", but in the end, one person still stooped down to help my father push the car into the trailer.
I am encountering such rude service for the first time.
Good shopping center. Clean and tidy. Large selection of shops and cafes with restaurants.
There is a cinema called "Cosmic" and an entertainment children's center called "Nevidalia".
On the lower floor is the large hypermarket "Lenta".
Convenient, large parking lot convenient location.
Good supermarket for cosmetics, underwear, and household goods.
Diverse assortment, reasonable prices, polite and attentive staff.
Consultants will definitely help with the choice, provide advice.
Everyone will find something necessary for themselves.
A good place to spend the evening.
The staff is very good, pleasant establishment.
I advise everyone to never make a mistake in their choice. The best establishment in Krasnodar where you can relax and everything will be great.
I recommend visiting)
We express our gratitude to Marina, who was our agent for organizing the funeral.
Having arrived at our request, she took on the responsibility of resolving all issues related to this difficult and sad event, helped us choose everything necessary, was always in touch and kept us informed of the progress.
Thanks to her, we were able to honor our loved one properly.
Everything was arranged, well organized, just as we discussed during our first meeting.
Marina, understanding perfectly well the state in which our loved ones were, gave advice on how to improve and sympathized with us in a simple human way.
This is a very good specialist in his field.
Thank you for everything.
Enticed by numerous positive reviews, I contacted "RemStirMash" and was assigned a master named Alexander.
He started the conversation by saying that he is completely free the next day and ready to help.
We discussed everything and set the time - 14.00.
The next day came - a morning call from the master and a statement that he won't be able to come, a complicated request (how is that possible? and where is "completely free"?) and if he can, he will come after 18.00 instead of the scheduled 14.00.
We agreed again for the next day.
15 minutes before the scheduled time, another master calls and says that instead of Alexander, he can come, but in 2 hours.
What kind of tricks is this?
One and a half days of empty waiting, all planned matters are set aside!
In short, a skilled master Ivan came and fixed the breakdown, for which we thank him.
So don't fall for empty promises and don't waste your time.
Evening observations completely did not meet expectations.
First there was a small lecture with unclear material, then we looked through the telescope.
Everything was not very organized, children kept climbing to see several times, adults crowded and couldn't let others see.
The objects that we observed through the telescope were of various sizes, ranging from the size of a regular star to those that can be seen without a telescope for free.
The girl answered the questions not very clearly, not understanding that ordinary people do not know many nuances.
It is not clear what the 600 rubles are for.
Amazing place, one of the oldest Mexican restaurants in the city, has been around since the early 2000s.
Cozy atmosphere, always friendly service.
Price is average.
To sit and eat 2-3 dishes for two people (portions are very large) + have a cocktail, around 2500 rubles. 👌
There are interesting beer cocktails based on beer and tequila, for example, I highly recommend trying Macho Boracho.
Price 420 rubles for 0.5 liters.
And overall, the food in the restaurant is very delicious, I don't know about others, but I really liked it, I will definitely recommend my friends to go there.
Great store, I have been buying goods from them for quite a long time, since the very opening.
Goods of good quality.
I bought a faucet, it has been five years already, and it is still working properly and in good condition.
That is why when we were doing a major renovation in the apartment, we took everything we needed right here.
Excellent refueling!!!
Located very conveniently, it is both close to the city center and to the outskirts of the region, overall convenient!
The gas quality is good, I refuel twice a week for over 2 years already, no problems, excellent price!!!
They accept payment by card and in cash, and they do not deceive with the volume.
The store was liked!
You can choose any model at an affordable price, and for any purpose!
Staff, always ready to help with the selection.
I bought a laptop for my daughter for studying because her laptop broke down.
Helped, found, gave a guarantee (one month) Thank you! 👍
The sommelier is working.
He helped with choosing the wine because it is difficult to figure it out on your own in such a large menu.
The experience of working with sommeliers is interesting and charming, Vasily, there is a shortage of such people in Moscow.
Eating zander is magical, respect to the chef.
Children's menu is the same everywhere: pasta, fries, chicken cutlets. My kids ate pizza, it's AMAZING here!
Adults appreciated it with truffle, while children with ham and mushrooms.
My husband ate smoked ribs - they are a bomb, soft, juicy, and aromatic.
The staff is good, everyone is smiling and friendly.
We liked it.
A brand new WB order pick-up point is located in a convenient place.
Working hours, from 10.00 to 21.00, without days off and holidays.
Inside the pick-up point there are fitting rooms.
Very good place.
Here work real professionals who are always ready to help.
There is also a group and chat in WhatsApp for informative communication.
Fast delivery.
It is pleasing that the product can be immediately viewed and tried on.
Great that it's close to home.
Excellent, modern hotel.
The room is spacious, very clean and cozy.
Everything that is stated in the description is available.
Breakfast is included in the price, a wide selection of dishes for every taste.
Convenient entrance, private parking near the entrance.
Solid 5.
Wonderful puppet theater.
We often go to various performances.
Today we went to the play "The Frog Princess".
At the moment, among children's performances, this is the best.
It was very interesting, there were many dolls, special effects.
Even my 14-year-old son, who went just for company, said it was a very good performance.
My husband and I vacationed for 10 days in January 2023.
The vacation was a success, everything was great!
I will start in order:
On the day of arrival, they called to confirm the time to expect us, provided information about the transfer cost (1400 from the airport), we ordered a taxi (at 23:00 the price was 850 rubles), we arrived quickly, there were no traffic jams, and we were let through the barrier without any problems.
The administrative building nearby was quickly arranged, in about 15-20 minutes.
There is an elevator in all buildings - this is a big plus!
The double room is spacious, with warm floors in both the room and the bathroom (without heating), a huge balcony with rattan furniture (a table and two chairs), and panoramic windows (in building 5).
The furniture in the room is normal, there is a ladies' table with a large mirror, the refrigerator is not very small, there is even a freezer.
In building 5, there are a lot of green plants.
Everything is clean, towels and linens are changed upon your request, but if you don't ask to change, they still change on the 4th day, the linens are of good quality.
The territory is well-maintained, there are benches everywhere, clean pathways, and beautiful lighting in the evening.
The minibus takes you to the beach and back every 30 minutes.
To the public transport stop 5 minutes.
In the cafeteria hall, friendly guys always wish you a good day.
The food is decent, but it depends on what you're looking for. It suited us perfectly, with a good selection and quality. There was always fish, chicken, meatballs, or something similar. Vegetables for a side dish every day, and their own delicious pastries. More than 4 drinks available, including whole bean coffee. They always bake pancakes for breakfast, but the cheese and sausage are not very good.
The medical staff is very friendly and loyal.
We were also lucky with the weather, there was no rain, the temperature was 11-16°C, sunny.
Everything was great, we really relaxed.
There is a desire to come again, specifically in January, when there are few vacationers)).
It's a pity that the swimming pool and fitness complex will not be put into operation.
Thank you to the entire team of the sanatorium for their coordinated and high-quality work!
We have been going to "Pole" since August.
My daughter turned 4 in September.
She likes everything, the coach praises her) that's the most important thing.
We go to Valeria Nikolaevna Pleshkova!)
I could never have imagined that my daughter is so flexible!
Wandering through the streets of St. Petersburg, my friends and I decided to check out this promising establishment - and we were not disappointed!
The prices are very affordable, and the incredibly delicious pizza is eaten in the blink of an eye, not even a crust remains.
Pleasant atmosphere and charming staff, in a word, I recommend :)
It so happened that I ended up in the Tomarovskaya hospital with high blood pressure and a rapid heartbeat.
And she was extremely surprised: cleanliness, order, wet cleaning twice, moreover, window sills, furniture, doors are wiped.
Dietary food, but excellent!!!
I was surprised that they bring tea with a sandwich (bread, butter, cheese) at 7 in the morning, so to speak, a pre-breakfast.
The medical staff is sensitive, they all administer both intramuscular and intravenous injections without exception!!!
While the IV drip is in place, they will come in, ask about how you're feeling...
I have previously had an echocardiogram done, but to do it like this - for the first time (unfortunately, I do not know the doctor's name, a young man).
Special thanks to the attending physician Vetoikhina Klavdiya Fedorovna!
A true professional: attentive, knowledgeable, provides comprehensive answers to any question; she found the right dosage and medications that normalized both blood pressure and heart rate, which she couldn't achieve before after consulting with other doctors.
Thank you very much to the chief doctor Mevsha Olga Vladimirovna, who organized the smooth operation of the hospital!!!
Thank you to the medical staff, the nurses, and the cooks!
When visiting the customer service, the impression remained good.
I met the administrator in the lobby.
Competent and polite specialists promptly and patiently assist clients with all their inquiries.
The specialist provided assistance in submitting the application and gave explanations regarding my question.
For a small store, the selection of goods is quite good.
There are semi-finished products, dairy products, vegetables, household chemicals, and various small items.
It operates 24/7, which is very convenient, always friendly staff.
It's great when there is a place in the city where you can go sledding.
The chairlifts and on weekends, of course, the queue gathers for 40 seconds of ascent and 5-10 minutes of waiting in line for descent.
But overall, it's cool, immersing in the atmosphere of positivity and winter, even if the roads are dirty and damp.
I contacted a service for repairing iPhone 11 Pro.
The rear window was broken and the battery needed to be replaced.
I contacted the master Alexander directly, who explained all the intricacies of the repair and immediately indicated the price range.
Thank you for the repair, everything was done with quality.
The masters are very pleasant to communicate with, they will show everything and tell everything.
However, during the replacement of parts, the camera was touched and the focus was disrupted.
I immediately reported the problem and received a quick response.
The error was fixed in the shortest possible time, everything is working properly.
In this service, there are good specialists with whom it is pleasant to have a conversation.
The prices are reasonable compared to other services, they are favorable.
If I need repairs again, I will definitely contact you!
Grand, beautiful, atmospheric.
But, like most historical objects, it requires close, prompt, and high-quality attention from restorers.
Therefore, 4 and the majority of these stars are given to the creators, not the holders.
Great apartment complex
Helpful concierges, garbage is cleaned up, clean and beautiful on the territory, close to bus stops, schools and shops.
20 minutes to the subway by public transport
Opened a good, cozy place for relaxation in our district.
There are all necessary shops.
Killer and diverse food court.
The tables are located in cozy areas.
No boredom.
Well, we visited, we tried...
The interior has nothing in common with a cozy Italian cafe...
There are very few seats, the tables are rectangular, like in a cafeteria.
Pizza... well, for those who haven't tried anything tastier, they will like it, but to me it seemed somewhat faceless.
I didn't really like the fact that the waiter is constantly standing behind you and almost always looking directly at your conversation partner's face.
We felt uncomfortable.
Connolly, yes, delicious.
We will not come here anymore and will not recommend it to our friends.
Lena Grosskopf is the best hairdresser I have ever had for cutting and coloring.
She does everything very carefully and with high quality, I enjoy going to her, I understand that everything will be done excellently.
I also only take my daughter to Lena.
The atmosphere of the salon is amazing.
Thank you very much!
We are from Nizhny, our car broke down on the way, kind people from KatResource quickly responded and helped us!
Respect to you and prosperity, may there be more such good people!
And in the service there it is clean and good!
We came to the concert of Sergey Chigrakov.
Excellent concert venue, wonderful sound and atmosphere.
We will definitely come to the planned concerts this year.
Cozy place, wonderful Georgian restaurant, live music is played on weekends and holidays!
The staff is pleasant and responsive!
There is a children's room.
Amazing Georgian cuisine!
The rating is the highest, I adore this place ❤
Park in the city center, very easy to get to.
The park is clean and there is a place for both children and adults.
But there has been no sand on the playground for a long time, only dust remains.
There is also a fenced football field, which, unfortunately, is not very well maintained.
But there are still more advantages in our park.
Spacious hall, clean, clear layout of goods.
There are products that can only be bought at Perekrestok.
The staff is welcoming.
I didn't buy any bad products.
Often there are promotions and discounts.
It is pleasing that it is close to home.
You can always find a parking spot.
We have been to the bar twice, everything was great, polite staff, delicious food, and most importantly - excellent music, the DJs know their stuff.
The only thing that disappoints the lead singer of the band "Ruki Vverkh Band" is the second time.
Not only does he sing softly, but he also reads the lyrics of most songs from his phone, especially when they are songs by the group "Ruki Vverh" (Hands Up).
It's somehow illogical (performing at the bar Ruki Vverh, in the band Ruki Vverh Band).
We rested in early March.
Good hotel, pleasant rooms.
In honor of the birthday, they gave a room with a view of the Kremlin.
Cleaning in the room every day.
Refilling water, tea, coffee, shampoo, and changing towels.
Breakfasts are simply mind-blowing.
There is a mini bar with insane prices.
If you want to order food from the restaurant to your room, you will pay an additional 20% for the service.
The prices in the restaurant are slightly inflated.
Tastes really good.
The water park was included in the accommodation cost.
The water park itself cannot be called the best in Russia.
And the masseur was just amazing.
Everything is great, but the departure was a little disappointing: no goodbyes, no safe travels.
The employee at the entrance didn't even help to open the door when he saw women with a bunch of bags and suitcases.
We need to work on this in order to maintain our reputation.
Great place to get together with friends and have a steam.
Large and comfortable sauna, there is a billiard room, an outdoor swimming pool, karaoke.
The food is delicious, the drinks are fresh.
Workshop on point!
In a short period of time, I have already repaired 3 pairs of shoes (2 for men and 1 for women).
Everything is fine.
The quality of work is excellent.
Special thanks to the master for the careful attitude and quality of work!
Wonderful basketball school!
My son has been going for 5 months and he really enjoys it, he eagerly awaits every training session.
Individual approach to children, interesting activities, warm and friendly atmosphere.
The store is excellent, the staff is okay, I order online myself.
Excellent location of the store.
Plus, there are always discounts and promotions, which is also good.
Good store AV - convenient location, large hall, good assortment.
Special thanks to the staff for their responsiveness!
There is a cafeteria with several tables.
I often visit - everything is fine!
Good pool!
I specifically mean "froggy". Our coach Anastasia Vitalievna is very liked by the child and professional!!
The changing rooms are clean, the water is warm, and there are hairdryers!
I love bakery cakes, service, croissants, breakfasts, and coffee are always top-notch.
But alas, not this time, I ordered coffee and a couple of croissants, the girls at the cash register didn't make the coffee until I reminded them, they made it undrinkable, it smells and leaves a taste of spoiled milk, I decided not to finish it and just left.
Last time there was a long black hair in my coffee, they replaced it.
Please be more careful, as I am a returning guest here, even after such incidents.
Gorgeous eyebrows are here!
Victoria corrects excellently, taking into account all the proportions of the face individually.
Warm wax correction, which effectively removes all fuzz, and eyebrows look neat for a long time.
The color is chosen according to the type of hair and skin, which allows the dye to last a long time.
You can't make better eyebrows!
Thank you so much for organizing my mom's move!
Moving is always a huge stress, but with your company everything went very smoothly, quickly, and with high quality.
Special thanks to Vadim and Roman!
I will recommend your company to all my acquaintances!
Everything is at the highest level.
We have been treating our teeth as a whole family specifically at Novodent for a long time.
Recently, we treated our 8-year-old son's teeth, everything went absolutely great, the child is calm and ready to come again.
There is no need to wait for a long time, there are no queues because appointments are made in advance.
In my opinion, the most delicious shawarma in Tambov is only here. I'm not a fan of shawarma, BUT when I want something unhealthy, only here and only here.
Delicious, fresh meat with lots of filling.
And I don't understand why, but it never leaks for me.
Often, when you finish eating shawarma, you no longer want to eat because there is a lot of sauce and it becomes watery, in short, yuck.... but not here.
Therefore, guys, you are the best🙂
Good teaching staff.
In the canteen, they always serve fresh food.
Interesting lessons in the school museum, various events are held throughout the academic year.
Nice store, polite employees, decent assortment.
However, a big downside is that the goods that are brought in are apparently being destroyed right in the sales area.
Sometimes there is not enough space to walk between the rows, and it is also not very pleasant when the goods are directly on the floor without pallets, but this is more of a remark about the organization rather than a specific store.
An exquisite example of Soviet architecture.
Strict magnificence, which is carefully cherished.
I received double pleasure from the concert, largely thanks to the atmosphere of the cultural center.
While we were waiting for the start in the lobby, I clearly felt that I had come to an Event, that this was truly a public appearance.
I was looking for a clutch kit for my Mercedes-Benz Sprinter.
I accidentally stumbled upon this online auto parts store.
I called, provided the VIN code, they said to wait.
They called back after about 10 minutes and offered several options.
Since the personal-work car did not save, he asked to order a good LUK clutch kit.
They called back in 5 minutes and said that they have good news for you.
If you don't take the whole set of basket + disc + release bearing, but instead take the LUK set of basket + disc and separately the LUK release bearing, it will be 2,000 rubles cheaper, which couldn't be happier.
Having disconnected the clutch, he went to the service.
When removing the gearbox, it was discovered that a flywheel is still needed and the faster, the better.
I already knew where to turn), the manager understood the situation and placed an order without prepayment over the phone (the first time I also paid upon receipt).
The next day, the flywheel was in hand.
The car is happy with the new flywheel and clutch, I am happy that everything arrived quickly and that they were accommodating.
I will definitely recommend and use vinkod.shop.
The New Year's party was a success, but with some nuances.
I booked a table for two, but they seated me at a table for four.
But it's not a problem.
It's just strange that they weren't warned.
The food is average, the fish turned out to be a complete failure.
The host of the contests made on PowerPoint at the school level, to be honest, is not very good.
BUT as for the music, everything is perfect.
The atmosphere was great.
Everything else seems like nitpicking.
Thank you for the event.
I am leaving my review with words of gratitude to all the staff of Maternity Hospital No. 7 in Chelyabinsk.
In this institution, only people who know and love their work, doctors and nurses, work like gods.
Both in the obstetrics and gynecology department, as well as in the maternity ward and in the postpartum department.
But special thanks to Kotlyarova E.Yu., who is the head of the maternity ward on the 5th floor, and Yarantseva N.V., who is a midwife in the maternity ward. Thank you very much for your help during the birth of my daughter, for your kind heart, and for your immense professionalism.
Beautiful store.
Large assortment of balls, always fast order processing and delivery.
Professional employees.
Very beautiful bouquets, made with great taste, always fresh flowers.
Visited the establishment on recommendation.
The food is amazing, the programs are lacking, the waiters are a bit cheeky, but we were in a great company with children and celebrating an important event, they were friendly.
There was no fiery presentation, the children were waiting.
You can confidently go for good cuisine.
