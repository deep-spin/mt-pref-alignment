The July issue is traditionally published during the Moscow Film Festival, and this, of course, is very sad: to read the strips when the soul yearns for Shabroly.
However, we will talk about the MIFF next time (for now, I will just complain that this year, the organizers' inexplicable idea that happy ticket holders are much more important for the festival than accredited guests has finally taken root in their minds, a ridiculous and quite offensive principle that no normal film festival in the world is guilty of), and in this issue, we will report on what we saw in Cannes and at the KINOTAVR.
The cover of the July issue is adorned with another pleasant face - the main character of the film "Predators", produced by Robert Rodriguez, and inside the magazine you will try to read the story about "The Beginning" by Christopher Nolan (a man, by the way, who rebooted "Batman..."), the most - without bullshit - anticipated film of the summer.
We are also publishing the first part of a fairly detailed guide to the work of Alfred Hitchcock, and here it is definitely not necessary to advertise anything special, and it is clear to me that the author of "Suspicion" and "The Rope" is our Tatyana Aleshicheva, Boris Glaizerov, Anna Golovnaya, Nick de Semlin, Dan Jolling, Tamara Dondurey, Nikolai Karayev, Denis Korsakov, Maria Kuvshennova, Ivan Kulikov, Will Lawrence, Sergei Mesenov, Sergei Natapov, Ian Nathan, Kim Newman, Zaira Ozova, Nev Pierce, Alexei Prostyanov, Seraphima Skibyuk, Adam Smith, Mur Soboleva, Vasily Stepanov, Alexander Strelkov, Ollie Richards, Oleg Tishchenkov, Alena Logunova, Chris Hewitt, Olga Shakina, Evelin Salt, despite her brilliant record, were suspected of spying for the Russians and decided to catch her at all costs.
Cornered, she will change her usual black color and go out to find the truth herself.
Another action movie with Angelina Jolie in the role of a seductive babe promises to further consolidate the actress's position in the action genre.
She will cause one accident after another, run around the walls like in the Matrix and knock strong men down like children in the same strict suits.
That's how beauty should save the world.
Here he is, the native one, who blew up and repaired the world with the "Fifth Element" and made Milla Jovovich the most beautiful woman in the universe.
Bruce Willis was the most superheroic guy, and Gary Oldman was the most stylish and flawless embodiment of Evil.
And yet, all together, it turned out to be not a tedious blockbuster of the American type about saving humanity, but a lovely living carnival.
What Beson did for 13 years between Element... and Adela... is not something I want to remember.
He was not idle, to put it mildly, but all this script-writing and production fuss and rare, forced directorial performances will be forgotten.
But “Adele...” is hardly.
When you watch this movie, it seems that the 13-year-old before us was not our Besson, but some kind of doppelganger.
And he himself, the real one, lived in a small apartment in Montmartre, drank wine in the cafe across the street and wrote a story about a charming adventurer.
To recount the plot (even in broad strokes), whetting expectations, is more sinful than usual in this case.
The whole incredible drive is that behind every turn or remark, surprises await you.
And they are all pleasant.
Either a girl or a vision
UNUSUAL ACCESSORIES FOR ADEL
The most exciting adventure film of the decade suggests that "The Extraordinary Adventures of Adele" will start like "Amelie", move towards "Jurassic Park", continue with "Indiana Jones" and "Mummy", and end with "Titanic".
The film is based on the first volume of Jacques Tardi's comics about journalist Adèle Blanc-Sec.
Louise Bourgeois before Adèle has appeared in only three films.
The actress became famous for her role in "The Girl from Monaco", for which she was nominated for a Cesar Award.
The director does not run after the audience with outstretched arms, begging them to appreciate the special effects, decorations, or stunts, but entices them, like an old-fashioned novelist exclaiming before a great journey to the center of the earth or to the edge of the world: "Come on, my reader, great things await us!"
At the same time, Besson treats genre cinema, about which he knows everything, unceremoniously and cheerfully, like a boy who has watched old films and read Jules Verne.
Manipulating banalities, not denying oneself cynicism and not being afraid to take risks
Director: Luc Besson
IN ROLES: Louise Bourguignon, Mathieu Amalric, Frederic Beil, Gilles Lellouche
SCENE: Strange things were happening in Paris in 1912.
The city was overwhelmed by an ancient monster that an old medium had awakened to life.
The police are chasing after the fossil, as well as a famous hunter, a couple of scientists from the natural history museum, and journalist Adèle Blanc-Sec, who has a case not so much with the beast itself, but with the medium - she needs to save her sister.
For the same purpose, the girl is dragging a real mummy from Egypt.
It will be released on July 22
"Adele..." - this is the case when a parody becomes the pinnacle of the genre and is capable of radically changing it, directing it down a new path.
This was the case with Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, with Quentin Tarantino's gangster films, with the aforementioned "Indiana Jones" (they paid tribute to him and made fun of him), and finally, with the same "Fifth Element".
Besson's style in this film is made up of verbal trickery, actorly clowning, and storytelling equilibristics (circus terms are quite appropriate - the union of the two arts here is organic and strong as ever).
A few words should be said about Adele herself.
It embodied the undeservedly forgotten type of adventuress, who takes not so much advantage of sexuality, as much as pure courage and bravery.
In movies, such girls are usually paired with some kind of macho or romantic loser.
TEXT: ALEXANDER STRELKOV
Face to face with history
There is only a timid and comical admirer, who only dances under his feet (his knowledge of zoology is useful).
Therefore, the energetic girl does not waste time on trivialities, but spends time in the company of ancient corpses, which, by the way, play a key role in the plot.
After being trained on numerous genre "cats" and seemingly completely exhausted, Luc Besson showed unexpected creative cunning, reminding us that the line between the preferences of bored mall visitors and the discerning art house regulars is easily crossed by films for cheerful eccentrics.
Playing adventure cinema without sadness, fear, and reproach
The Death Room
A hermetic horror with pretensions to psychology and a political context, Jonathan Liebesman's debut horror film in 2002 was panned by critics, but was well received by the public and did well at the box office, and most importantly, it caught the eye of producer Michael Bay.
This is how the young director ended up at a factory that churns out new horrors according to old formulas: Bay set himself the goal of re-shooting the entire horror classics in the form of remakes and entrusted LeBesman with the prequel to "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (2006).
The critics grumbled again, but the public liked it again - Leibesman worked in the spirit of the "new horrors", emphasizing the excessive physiological nature of violence.
In general, his example shows how an entire genre is convulsing, trying to invent new ways to affect an overstimulated audience: the naturalistic gore of splatter films merges with the chase scenes of slashers.
The plot is reminiscent of the "Saw" franchise, but without the gallons of blood.
Among the prototypes is Vincente Natali's debut film "Cube". The film was not made by Michael Bay.
So in "The Death Room" Libesman had to take a different path: he preferred the more intelligent option of a clever maniac rather than a brutal massacre or monotonous chase, with almost no bloodshed, but with psychological games and puzzles.
The evil doctors here play cat and mouse with the test subjects.
Three men in a locked room try to work out a survival strategy: to unite as a team or shoot each other?
Play by the rules and obey orders from outside?
Or try to break out of your cage at any cost?
They are not the only ones to undergo testing, but also a young, ambitious employee of the special services, who is tested for ruthlessness by an experienced professor who is well-versed in wild experiments.
SCENE: For $250, four volunteers sign up for a simple test.
They are put in an isolated room and given a stack of sheets with meaningless questions.
Then a polite man in a white coat enters the room, introduces himself as a doctor and shoots one of the subjects in the head.
The game of survival begins, which is closely watched by government agents behind the glass.
Too contemplative for horror, but not enough for explicit art house
He can conduct a secular conversation and go on a ride with a fire extinguisher, but he cannot pass up a single skirt.
Charming Nastya, on the contrary, is discerning and unyielding in her sympathies.
She is offended by her father's courtly lifestyle and openly watches as he dives into the pool for another romantic victim, as if parodying the famous scene from Paul Verhoeven's Showgirls.
The daughter rebels, and the father tempts her young suitor from a poor family with money.
But the main topic of the family conflict is not the difference in generations or the choice of profession, which is already predetermined in one way or another, but the unsuccessful attempts of the girl to refute the obvious idea that in modern Moscow everything is bought and sold.
Mher Mkrtchan, along with Pavel Bardyn, filmed a comedy with Ivan Urgant called "Three and a Snowflake".
Depardieu convincingly portrayed the father of a growing daughter in the genre of comedy
The fragmented plot revolves around the love affairs of the characters, who are always talking about psychology, but themselves, apparently, due to a witty directorial discovery, focus on the language of the gaze and gesture.
The secondary plot branches (a girl who was injured in a car accident and whom Alexei wants to marry, a drunkard athlete played by Sergei Gorobchenko) are, alas, only sketched in.
It is especially regrettable that the line about the business of buying up football players, and the one that was left out, are both true.
SCENE: The fate of his underage daughter Nastya is of utmost concern to the world's top football star sales agent.
The good-hearted dad changes his girlfriends like expensive shirts, but his daughter is about to turn eighteen, and she must certainly marry a guy with a backbone.
What a disappointment it is for a businessman when Nastya, in the struggle for independence and in defiance of her father, chooses her peer and business partner.
But with a potential tagline for the film's audience, the author hit the mark: "Don't look for trouble where it doesn't exist." More precisely, you couldn't say it better.
Their resemblance is simply striking.
In both films, there are groups of tough guys, lucky soldiers, who are forced to take revenge on those who betrayed them, and there is always one beautiful girl in each company.
The heroes race through almost the same parts of the world (both films start in Latin America and end in the port of Los Angeles) and use the same spectacular shots - in both films something stuffed with dollar bills explodes and a whirlwind of bills descends on the set.
Even the villains, dressed in expensive costumes, are not easy to distinguish from each other (they are played by the same actor in both cases - Jason Patrick here, Patrick Wilson there).
Zoe Saldana's previous role was Neytiri in Avatar.
Sylvain White used to make dance battles - "Dance Brotherhood".
Chris Evans was recently called to play the hero of other comics: he will be Captain America.
Director Sylvain White was inspired by a series of comics that came out in the 70s and was rebooted in the 2000s, and Joe Carnahan was inspired by a comedy series from the 80s.
It's just amazing how they, without colluding, brought different material to an absolutely identical thundering signifier, making rather heavy, predictable, unnecessary action movies that evoke a lot of pictures with Willis and Schwarzenegger (comparisons invariably turn out in favor of Bruce and Arnold).
If you have to choose between the two, the Lusers look a little more appealing and are clearly more efficient in terms of efficiency (after all, the budget is three and a half times smaller).
At least there's Zoe Saldana, who looks great in a bikini
IN THE ROLES: Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Zoey Saldana, Chris Evans, Patrick Wilson, Idris Elba, Columbus Short
SCENARIO: During an operation in the Bolivian jungle, a group of experienced commandos working for the CIA was betrayed by their own superiors: the helicopter carrying the children they were trying to save was blown up, and the soldiers themselves were considered dead from that moment on.
But they are alive - and intend to take revenge on the scoundrel with the deep voice who orchestrated it all.
All of this is cute, but, to be honest, it's worth spending an hour and a half of your life on a White painting only if you have absolutely no other options.
A condiment made from recycled materials
A simple story about a Romanian convict on the run
A Romanian low-budget film that won an award at a prestigious international film festival.
In principle, with only these data in hand, one can vividly imagine the hypothetical content of the picture, and even some specific details of the form.
Without a shadow of a doubt, the film promises to be sharply social.
It will certainly be realistic, and tough.
There is a high probability of participation of non-professional actors.
There will also be a lot of Romanian poverty in the film (yes, poverty knows no nationality, but Romanian poverty, as our festival laureates prove from film to film, is particularly poor).
Also, without knowing the year of release, one can easily accept what is happening on the screen as the exercises of some underground critical realists from the Warsaw Pact countries, who were lectured on Bresson in the early 80s.
The film received the Grand Prix of the Jury at the Berlin Film Festival.
The script is based on a play by Andrea Valian, whose work is in high demand among Romanian New Wave directors.
Operator Marius Panduru often works with Corneliu Porumbacu.
Everything said is true for Florin Serban's debut work, and - understand us correctly - is not at all pejorative, but rather recommendatory: the Romanian "new wave" is in that blessed stage of development when its representatives believe in the methods
His work has not yet been shaken.
And this moment must be caught: it is only thanks to this faith that one can endure the one and a half hour spectacle of the Romanian colony for minors and surrender to the charisma of the talented Pistoreanu (whose story, despite the chasm separating two cultures, can easily be shared
convert it into an exploitation film à la 70s, with a cowboy who decides to walk out of prison, where he will soon be released, to the nearest saloon).
IN ROLES: Georg Pistereanu, Adina Condescu, Mihai Constantin, Clara Voda, Marian Bratu
SYNOPSIS: After serving his four years, 18-year-old convict Silvio (Pistoreanu) is about to be released, but suddenly finds out that his mother wants to take his younger brother with her to Italy.
From this point on, the young man's behavior becomes inadequate.
The flirtation with social worker Anna further spurs the guy to desperate acts, the meaning of which is exhausted by the title of the picture.
What a load of rubbish!
If you want to watch, watch.
A decent debut, giving faint hope that a decent direction will emerge from Romanian art-house cinema someday
A cartoon about the joys of villainy and family life
The directorial debut of a man named Grob (Sop) and his co-author Reno was made under the auspices of producer Christopher Meldandri, the gray cardinal of American animation, responsible, in particular, for all the "Ice Ages", "Horton" and "Robots".
"Hateful Me" is probably the best work of his team: the picture is beautifully drawn (by the way, it makes sense to watch it in 3D), especially if you like it when different objects keep jumping out of the screen and into the hall), it is well written, and, most importantly, there is not a single low-brow joke here, due to which you had to blush and hide your face in the "Ice Age" movies.
It is clear that the reason for the change in course was not the authors' sense of measure, but the glaring asexuality of the main character, which in turn was dictated by the unwillingness to touch on the topic of pedophilia in any way.
For the "adult" part here, in addition to the main conflict of single fatherhood, there is quite harsh black humor (which, I would like to think, we owe to the director Coffin).
Overall, it's a very likable movie - so much so that at some point it even becomes too perfect and right.
It is clear that a lot of hard work has gone into the film by a team of marketers who have thought of every detail to make the film appealing to all categories of citizens.
Not that we want to see the cannibals eat the heroes of the children's cartoon or the atomic explosion destroy them
SCENE: The bulbous villain Gru, whose childhood dreams of space exploration have over the years transformed into the idea of stealing the Moon, to fulfill his grand plan and eliminate a young competitor, is forced to resort to the help of children.
In some advanced orphanage, he adopts three female orphans - Margo in glasses, Edith in a hat, and Agnes, who is as cute as a kitten from Shrek.
As is usually the case, children immediately transform the plans of adults.
The main character is modeled after Christopher Melendy - they are both bald, big-nosed, and have a penchant for black humor.
In the original, the main characters were voiced by Steve Carell and Jason Segel.
In the final, Grue dances Travolta's part
A truck pulls up to an abandoned trailer somewhere in the middle of a hypothetical desert, and three pairs of the finest breasts step out of it.
That's right.
The carriers of this gift themselves are not so significant.
The camera confidently focuses attention on this part of the body.
For those who appreciate it, we have some good news right away - the entire film is in the same spirit.
Rick Jacobson understands the most important things about women's beauty and the casting was done in such a way that what happens on the screen is of secondary importance.
And a lot of fun things happen.
The "broker", "killer" and "stripper" dig in the sand, get drenched (don't ask why), carry some kind of purge and periodically fight like mad.
The creators believe that a pregnant sow with generous forms, smeared in mud, with a broken nose and shining white teeth is cool.
"Stervoznye shutki" are primarily focused on classic sexplaylists.
Rick Jacobson filmed episodes of "Zena - Queen of Warriors" and "The Amazing Adventures of Hercules".
A film close in spirit to this one in the Moscow box office is "The Pole for Jennifer".
It's also cool when a bitchy beauty whips eggs at a gangster, a mohawked punk fights alongside a Japanese schoolgirl, a samurai sword is involved, and lesbian sex is had; and the plot is driven by an endless number of flashbacks.
In general, for a film fetishist, there is a real Klondike of pleasures here.
It is clear, of course, that Jacobson and his gang were having a great time making this trash parody, but the task itself seems rather strange.
If it weren't for the physical data of the actresses, it would have been boring by the middle.
It can be assumed that this game came to us from the adult night channel (Jacobson, by the way, often takes on serial episodes)
IN ROLES: Julia Voth, Erin Cummings, America Olivo, Michael Hirst, Ron Melendez
SCENE: Three dangerous beauties bring the head of the mafia to the desert, who has diamonds worth a substantial sum hidden somewhere here.
After failing to achieve anything and shooting the unfortunate bandit, the women start to bite, fight with each other and periodically arriving scoundrels from somewhere, as well as regularly kiss and hug.
As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that none of the three are who they appeared to be at the beginning.
Apparently, according to the author, it's even more funny.
A product for a narrow circle of lovers of monstrous bad taste
Yes, with his latest film, Judgment Day, the disillusioned Mad Max for the poor, Marshall has made a serious misstep
The bloodthirsty and biting peplum returns the director's shaken confidence.
The new politically incorrect and grim magnum opus is not ashamed of a modest budget, obvious sources of inspiration, and a fierce B-category film aesthetic.
The film also features the hooligan bravado of "Dog Warriors" and the animalistic brutality of "The Descent".
The "Marshall Plan" to clean up the "peplum" from the accumulated post-gladiatorial cinematic dirt, in general, worked.
In 2011, Kevin McDonald will present his interpretation of the history of the Ninth Legion.
His battle-scarred legionaries (among others, the unexpectedly colorful David Morrissey and Liam Cunningham) are tough guys trying to reconcile their military duty with an overwhelming desire to survive.
Infanticide and the intimate details of natural needs in ancient times are depicted here with love and detail.
The scene of the destruction of the Ninth Legion, which took a lot of budget money, is directly inspired by the opening sequence in the German forests from the now classic "Gladiator" by Sir Ridley Scott, but for some reason, one does not want to accuse Marshall of plagiarism: he works honestly and without complaints.
IN THE ROLES: Michael Fassbender, Olga Kurilenko, Dominic West, Liam Cunningham, David Morrissey
SCENE: The lands of modern Scotland, occupied by the Holy Roman Empire.
A remote outpost, where centurion Quintus Diaz (Fassbender) is stationed, is ruthlessly overrun by a Pictish scouting party.
The miraculously saved Diaz is forced to first join the infamous Ninth Legion, and then, with a group of other surviving Romans, try to escape from a group of Pictish fighters led by the sadist Etain (Kurilenko).
The subtle art-house actor has so far managed to win only bit parts in Hollywood, but it is very much hoped that after Centurion, the situation will change.
Pepulum - an edition corrected and supplemented.
Almost like "Gladiator", only more modest and harsh
The story continues about schoolgirl Bella (Kristen Stewart) and her complicated relationship with two extremely promising young people - the pale-faced vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and the werewolf-cultivator Jacob (Taylor Lautner).
Pattinson's fans held their breath.

A group of hardened thugs led by the seemingly fragile Royce (Adrien Brody) mysteriously find themselves on another planet, where they are hunted by stylish fanged aliens.
The return of the cult character of the 80s to the big screen.
Pay attention to George Clooney, who teamed up with rock photographer-turned-director Anton Corbijn ("Control") for a very curious existential exploration of the psychology of an aging hitman hiding from people in a small Italian town and belatedly coming to grips with human nature.
"The visionary artist of Corbijn's scale and the magnificent George Clooney are a cinematic union made in heaven," boasts the studio press release.
In addition, this project is another confirmation of Clooney's longest love affair in life - with Italy: filming took place in the picturesque town of Castel del Monte in Abruzzo.
Taking Martin Booth's novel "A Very Private Gentleman" as a basis, Rowan Joffe made some changes to his script: the English narrator was replaced by an American in the title, and the main character, who was a gunsmith-criminal, was turned into a simple murderer.
Otherwise, the story is close to the original: while the hitman Jack tries to deal with his last job and finally give up his lucrative profession, his icy heart melts under the charm of the local priest (Paolo Bonacelli) and a street prostitute (Tekla Ruten), whom the character of Clooney instantly falls in love with.
"Jack tempts fate," says the official synopsis.
A dangerous messenger of darkness is getting closer and closer to him, and the mysterious lady who hires him may not be who she claims to be."
Judging by the trailer, Corbijn's visual experiments, seasoned with Clooney's ashy hair (the film is like a long music video), have reached a qualitatively new level.
Daniel Radcliffe will play the lead role in the film adaptation of Remarque's "All Quiet on the Western Front"
Or maybe I can shoot you with a camera!?
This season, Johnny Depp could be seen in two places at once.
First, in Venice, on the set of the thriller "Tourist" by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck ("The Lives of Others").
There he plays a tourist in love with Angelina Jolie's character.
Secondly, in Puerto Rico, at the Romantic Diary platform, the screen adaptation of the debut novel by the legendary Hunter S. Thompson.
The director and screenwriter of the project is Bruce Robinson ("Withnail and I"), whose last directorial work was the thriller "Jennifer 8" in 1992.
Looking at the work of the poster artists of the domestic prison drama, one can even doubt that they were inspired.
But you can't approach the issue of implementing the idea literally!
However, at least it's good that the heroine of the Russian film is not a stranger, but not completely bald.
Director Danny Boyle mainly specializes in projects with Adam Sandler.
They have already worked on four joint projects: "The Lucky Gilmore", "Big Daddy", "Chuck and Larry: Firefighter Wedding", "Don't Mess with Gohan!".
In July, the fifth comedy, "Classmates", will be released, and the sixth, "The Wife-Imposter", with Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman.
The schedule also includes the seventh film - the romantic comedy "Jack and Jill", where Sandler will play both Jack and his twin sister Jill at the same time.
Matthew Vaughn, who impressed viewers this year with the spectacular action film "Kick-Ass", will be in charge of rebooting the X-Men.
In the film "X-Men: First Class", the director first called James McAvoy, giving him the role of a young Xavier.
Rosamund Pike will play the mutant telepath Emma Frost, aka the White Queen, Amber Heard will transform into the blue-skinned Mystique, and Michael Fassbender is supposed to become Magneto.
While filming of the new series of Bond is delayed, its new director Sam Mendes is not bored.
On his list of works is the musical "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" and the screen adaptation of Iain Macleod's novel "On the Shore".
The author adapts the script himself.
Carey Mulligan has been offered the lead female role.
Gary Oldman is considering the role of the practical Major George Smiley - the main character of the series of novels by John Le Carre - in the screen adaptation of the thriller "Spy, get out!".
In the first adaptation of this work in 1979, Alec Guinness played the lead role.
The new version will be directed by Danish director Thomas Alfredson, creator of the horror film "Let Me In".
Tom Tykwer is adapting the fantasy bestseller by David Mitchell, Cloud Atlas.
According to the director, it is not an easy task (the novel has six parallel storylines), but it is an extremely interesting work.
He has already received offers from Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, James McAvoy, Ian McKellen and Natalie Portman.
Filming of the international action film by Maxim Korostyshevsky is taking place in Crimea under the working title "Soldiers of Fortune".
It is dedicated to millionaires who went to a real war in search of adrenaline.
The cast includes Christian Slater, Sean Bean, Ving Rhames, Dominique Monaghan, Oksana Korostyshevskaya, and others.
The film is scheduled to premiere in early 2011.
Sam Rockwell will star in the comedy "Baby Jesus" along with English pop star Pixie Lott
Megan Fox was fired from Transformers 3
According to the Ragoutiye film company, the dismissal is not related to the interview in which Fox compared Michael Bay to Hitler.
However, the main heroine and new love interest of Shia LaBeouf's character is likely to be English model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.
The girl has no experience in film, so she will have to take accelerated acting courses.
This fact should not scare the discerning viewer - there are many examples in the history of cinema of successful retraining of models into actresses.
Charlize Theron ("Monster"), Angelina Jolie ("Interrupted Life"), Jessica Lang ("Blue Sky", "Tutsi"), Kim Basinger ("Secrets of Los Angeles"), Jennifer Connelly ("Mind Games"), Gina Davis ("The Random Tourist") and "First Vice-Miss USA-86" Halle Berry ("Ball of Monsters") started as models or appeared in fashion magazines, and eventually received a well-deserved "Oscar".
They have succeeded in acting (also the beauties Milla Jovovich, Cameron Diaz, Monica Bellucci and, especially pleasing, our compatriot Olga Kurilenko.
High honors are clearly within their reach.
In short, Rosie has someone to take an example from.
Valeria Gai Germankina, who received a Special Mention from the Cannes jury in 2008 for the film "Everyone Will Die, and I Will Remain" and directed the scandalous TV series "School", has been appointed creative director at the MT TV channel.
The channel's management believes that it is Valeria who will be able to bring about the desired and necessary changes.
In particular, the production of their own series (about teenagers or vampires) is already being planned.
Also, Germanka began casting new hosts.
The comedy "Kolotilov" by director Leo Gabriadze and producer Timur Bekmambetov unexpectedly turned into "Vykrutasy".
The main theme of the film remains the same - provincial Russian language teacher Slava Kolotilov (Konstantin Khabensky) rushes to Moscow to meet his fiancée, but is delayed to coach a team of street children.
The second plot line of the picture has received a new development.
Instead of actress Elena Plaskina, the role of the capital's bride Nadya will be played by Milla Iovovich.
A third character will appear as an additional intrigue - Nadia's former fiancé Danya (Ivan Urgant).
Thus, in addition to the question of whether the street team will win the football championship, the dilemma arises of who will get Mila Jovovich.
Due to the constant delays in the filming of "The Hobbit" and the presence of a large number of side projects, Guillermo del Toro declined the position of director.
The studios are trying to persuade producer Peter Jackson to take the case entirely into his own hands, but he is only willing to agree to this step if there is an urgent need.
Possible successors include David Yates, who has finished filming the Harry Potter saga, and Neil Blomkamp, whose film District 9, produced by Jackson, was nominated for an Oscar.
The new director's official name will be announced at the next Sots-Sop convention at the end of July.
Angelina Jolie will play Cleopatra
Exhausted by the rigid schedule, critics and filmmakers raced between the Sochi Winter Theatre, where screenings with master classes were held, and the Zhemchuzhina Hotel, where press conferences and round tables were held in a constant stream, barely managing to dive into the Black Sea.
The heroes of the competition films also behaved in a similar way - almost everyone ran away somewhere: the confused Asians from Yusup Razyakov's "Gastarbeiter" and Dmitry Mamulia's "Drugaya neba" were looking for their missing grandson and wife, and the fugitive bandit from Yuri Bykov's "Zhit"
The same cops happily circled their fingers around the hero of the detective novel "Who am I?" by Klim Shipenko, who, however, was remembered by the public more for his presence in the frame of the totally naked Zhanna Friske.
Heroes of the domestic show business appeared, and there were a couple of competition pictures - in the film "Elephant", Sergei Shnurov played a long-distance truck driver carrying a circus animal to slaughter, and Yevgeny Grishkovets mused on his favorite topics - female betrayal, male loneliness, the healing power of alcohol - in the film "Satisfaction", where business partners challenged each other to a drinking duel over a woman.
However, business events at the Kinoshka festival also had a noticeable show aspect - there was not a single one that was boring.
At a round table dedicated to the fate of Russian art house, the chairman of the fund for supporting domestic cinema, Sergei Tolstikov, set up a lively discussion with critics: “Do you even read the articles in the press that I read?” he sternly asked the gathered.
"I write them," the president of ERVESS, Andrey Plakhov, responded in confusion.
The scandals didn't end there: closer to the end of the festival, the film "Ovsyanki" by Aleksey Fedorchenko was suddenly removed from the competition program - it will go to Venice: the selection committee in Mostry decided that an additional Russian showing would be a hindrance to them.
Previously, Kinoshka did not interfere with the giants - in Sochi, films from large festivals were shown several times: this time, for example, Sergei Loznitsa's film My Happiness was in the competition, which in the spring competed with Mikhalkov and Virasatkan on the Cote d'Azur.
Nikita Sergeevich visited the film of a former Cannes competitor at the KinoTavr festival and said that he liked it.
The chairman of the jury, Karen Shakhnazarov, on the contrary, did not like the film Loznitsa at all - but under pressure from his colleagues he was forced to give her the prize for directing.
The daughter received the award for best debut - "Missing"
A terrifying film encyclopedia of Russian life: naive, humane, and rational heroes are beaten, robbed, and provoked to commit monstrous acts without any apparent purpose.
A precisely executed, cleansing film-experiment, made by a misanthrope with a mathematical education, which calls for only one thing - start thinking.
A debutant with a philosophical education, Mamulia calls the films quotes from Mamaradshvili, avoids any events in the script and claims that the joy of the viewer is in the work of understanding his little-known meditative films.
The most difficult film of the Kinozavr festival has already been selected for the Karlovy Vary competition - the directorial star was born.
The impeccably dressed and groomed programmer Leonid reacts to the world with restrained disgust, hiding in the burrow of an orderly bachelor's life.
But a cast-iron babushka descends on the house, a hand of the punitive authorities descends on the hero's head, and he begins a senseless run through Kafkaesque spaces and situations.
"Sometimes it's useful to work not only with debutants," the producer Sabina Yeremeyeva triumphantly declared from the stage, taking the prize.
Critics thought otherwise: in their opinion, Sabine simply managed to pull out the "inner debutant" from the patriarch of domestic art cinema.
And this is symptomatic - nowadays in our cinema, bison are moving with the youth.
Not at all.
Documentary film, shot in a way that blows your mind more than a similar artistic one.
The author is interested in a screwdriver that examines an electric meter, and a piece of unsalted butter drifting on a cast-iron skillet, -— all of this turns the story of an unemployed miner, his rare-toothed lover, and her criminal brother into a real oil painting.
The winner of the short film competition, Nikolai Sokolov, applies the black and white aesthetic of the French New Wave to the world of sleepy suburbs.
The year-round assembly halls in the story about two schoolboys, one of whom dreams of making a bomb and the other of playing Bach backwards, may seem strange, but for the rare attempt to poetize the surrounding reality, thank you.
"Three times a year - on the eve of Victory Day, Russia Day and City Day - about ten aircraft of the An-12, Il-18, An-32, An-24 type, equipped with meteorological equipment and technical means of cloud modification and loaded with special environmentally friendly chemicals - liquid nitrogen, granulated carbon dioxide (dry ice), meteorological pyrotechnics with iodine silver and powdered reagents - rise into the sky.
The process works as follows: planes at a distance of 50-100 kilometers from Moscow (depending on the length and strength of the rain front) “break up” the clouds coming towards the city with these agents. The particles of the substances condense around themselves with moisture.
As a result, precipitation occurs earlier than planned, and precisely in the place where the cloud was affected."
Work on a remake of the science fiction film, in which Michael York played the lead role, has been underway for ten years.
Recently, the director was appointed Carl Rinsch (he already has a remake of "Creatures from the Black Lagoon" in his schedule), who made his name with his advertising spots.
Previously, the project was associated with the names of Brian Singer (X-Men), James McTigue (V for Vendetta) and Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy).
According to the plot, the hero, who is thirty years old, is forced to flee from the death sentence, as the society of the future executes all citizens upon reaching this age.
Robert Rodriguez has acquired the rights to the 80s rotoscopic fantasy cartoon and plans to make a big-budget movie out of it.
The original was the result of the joint creativity of director Ralph Bakshi (The Lord of the Rings, 1976) and fantasy artist Frank Frazetta.
The theme of the cartoon was swords, magic and a large number of drawn cucumbers.
In it, warrior Larn saves Princess Tiga and the entire nation from the evil ruler of ice Nekron.
Rodriguez promises to pay close attention to the creation of non-humans and barbarians on pterodactyls.
George A. Romero will send his zombies on vacation for the time being, as he himself plans to remake Dario Argento's classic giallo film.
The heroes will be brought back to the big screen by none other than Michael Bay - the master of action, explosions, and horror remakes.
The director of the remake will be Damin Chen, who will also adapt the script.
Arjentano and Romero have already collaborated on "The Day of the Dead" and together they filmed "Two Evil Eyes" in 1990.
This time Dario is not directly involved in the project, but his brother Claudio is producing the film and writing the script.
Jennifer Garner and Nick Nolte will join Russell Brand and Helen Mirren in the remake of the comedy "Arthur"
"I wanted to bring more strength to the female character to reflect the situation in China," says Chen.
Chinese women are running big businesses and winning Olympic gold these days.
Gong Li embodies this strength."
For the second time in a row, you are playing an imaginary character.
Is it a coincidence?
The law of nature.
I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I am presenting two films here (at the Kinoshka film festival and the Sochi film market - EMRE).
And in both I play a woman of dreams.
But... that's how the director saw me, that's how he presented me, and many people probably think that's how I am in real life.
Dream girl.
Your co-star Alexander Yatsenko is nothing like his character.
How did you find common ground? What is it like on the platform?
He is not at all what he seems at first glance.
At first I saw him and thought, "Yeah... it's not just me."
Probably, without human contact, sincere and real, we would not have succeeded.
And this contact happened literally a few minutes after we met.
We have become great friends, I'm not afraid to say so.
I told him about all my fears, all my worries, what I was afraid of, that I was afraid it wouldn't work out, and I asked him for some advice and help, and he gladly gave me that advice and help.
We talked a lot...
I tried to do this because I was very afraid of losing this contact, of losing our mutual understanding.
And so at the premiere we watched the whole film holding hands.
How did the filming in Sevastopol go?
Sevastopol is the city where I came for the first time.
I have never had a vacation there, nor have I ever gone there as a child.
This city has a special magic, a certain character, a certain charm.
And it is a city that one wants to return to.
He has his own provincial charm.
A place where no one is in a hurry and everyone always has time.
It turns out that it was not difficult for you to play the role of being in love with this city.
In general, you are extremely organic on screen, which many people, frankly, did not expect.
How do you work with roles?
Are emotional scenes easy for you to do?
You know, I'm an amateur actor.
And I am very, by nature, a trusting person.
If I came and agreed to work with the director, then I am, in fact, entrusting myself to his hands and I want to be the test, from which they will mold.
I understand perfectly well that I am more visible, and I, again, ask for advice and talk to the director for a very long time, not even I talk to him, but he talks to me, and he has preliminary conversations with me and explains to me very clearly and precisely what he needs.
And then, through long, many-hour rehearsals, we come to the organic quality you're talking about.
And how did you work with the film's director Klim Shipenko?
I was thrilled with everyone, the operator, the director, the producer, Sasha Yatsenko.
Because I love working with crazy people!
I saw the same thing when I worked with Timur Bekmambetov.
He was ready to go without sleep, without food - and here was exactly the same situation.
Do not sleep, do not eat for days - and still, even if it's thunder, even if it's hail.
And if something didn't work out, it was a disaster, and you had to do something urgently to make it work.
It's very easy to work in this atmosphere of madness.
And it seems to me that when people are so far gone to the point of painful fanaticism in what they are doing, it cannot fail, because too much energy is being expended.
What scenarios are you rejecting?
What are the criteria for selecting the material you will work with?
I don't want nonsense, stupid dialogues, films that say nothing, films that don't carry anything.
I don't want to work just to appear on the screen once again.
Do you have any proposals, projects that you plan to work on in the near future?
There are no specific proposals or plans at the moment.
I am not the person who draws graphs.
The script came, I was interested in it, and today this premiere happened.

While we are working on the November issue, film festivals are almost continuously taking place in Moscow: American cinema - Amfest, 2togo, 2-t-1 will start in a few days, followed by the British Film Festival.
And here's what's interesting: half of my acquaintances are constantly discussing who needs to be boycotted and who needs to be supported, for some - well, excuse me - very vague reasons.
Moreover, when one of these festivals is solemnly closed with a terrifying Chu4 project without English subtitles, no one seems to notice anything.
It's the last thing you want to do, but if you buy a ticket with money and then stay in the theater to watch giant pixels and horizontal figures of actors, then that's what you'll get.
Meanwhile, we have no pixels: "Tron: Legacy" (a sequel to the classic film about virtual reality), "Let Me In. Saga" (an American remake of the excellent Swedish film), "Uncontrollable" (another approach by Tony Scott to the topic of trains) and a wildly detailed story about how the films about Conan, the barbarian, destroyer and governor were created.

The serial fairytale about the cute wizard with glasses is nearing its end.
And even if fans of the series have long since read the book and know how it will end, those who have never heard of the word "Expelliarmus" will stay home, and the title of the main blockbuster of November for Harry is practically reserved.
By the way, the studios are not fools either: in order to prolong the audience's enjoyment and squeeze the maximum out of the franchise, they decided to split the seventh film into two parts.
So the sentimental farewell to the magical world of Hogwarts will last until next summer.
SOCIAL NETWORK
The history of the creation of the Facebook network
David Fincher's new film is, first and foremost, a story about a paradox.
The film tells the story of the invention of Facebook, one of the pioneering tools in the field of the Internet, which united the whole world, estranged five friends and made its creator, 26-year-old former Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, the youngest billionaire of recent decades.
Jesse Eisenberg is as great in the lead role as our conflicted genius, emotionally isolated social outcast with an unpredictable set of motivations and attachments.
Zuckerberg is launching the site for a number of reasons: partly because of his anger at the world, partly because of his interest in sports, and partly just because it's "cool".
The very idea and its implementation may seem spontaneous and impulsive, but the actual course of events suggests a clear calculation and a well-thought-out business plan.
The strengths of "The Social Network" become apparent from the first frames, especially in the scene before the opening credits, where Zuckerberg talks in a bar with his ex-girlfriend Erica (Mara): the ringing, tough dialogues of the screenwriter Aaron Sorkin gain strength here and do not soften until the very end.
The same goes for Fincher's direction: relatively restrained (except for the Winklevoss twins, who were played by actors who didn't look alike).
The face of one of them was superimposed on another using computer graphics.
Natalie Portman studied at Harvard at the same time as Zuckerberg.
Runna Mara has been cast in the lead role in Fincher's next film, "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo".
Director David Fincher
IN THE ROLES: Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Rune Mara, Justin Timberlake, Ermi Hammer, Joshua Pens
SCENE: The gloomy and introverted Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, having turned a corner in his personal life, takes on the ambitious task of creating a fundamentally new social network.
As Facebook's popularity grows, relationships with a few close friends begin to sour and eventually lead to legal proceedings.
The color palette plays its role: warm, sometimes sunny, even in the dark it remains cozy, it maneuvers between two tangled chains of events and two separate legal disputes.
There is not much that happens outside the endless discussions in the film: no deaths, no murders, and all of Zuckerberg's legal troubles hardly warrant an additional paragraph for his meager Wikipedia page.
What attracted 49-year-old Sorkin and 48-year-old Fincher to this not very detailed story?
After watching, there is a persistent feeling that "Social Network" is a portrait of our time, and the understatement in this case is an important artistic technique.
Just twenty years ago, Wall Street was doing about the same thing, only on a larger scale - with cosmic egos and big deals.
Now that the daily liquidity has become even higher, the policy is no longer being implemented at board meetings or in the boardroom.
Zuckerberg wants to be special, he dreams of becoming the center of attention.
Severin (Garfield) is offended that his best friend has a new best friend (Timberlake) and now he has no one to play with.
Winkless (Hammer and Pence), meanwhile, are tapping their feet: who said that rich, beautiful, and athletic people can't also be smart?
(This line is particularly amusing to Fincher.)
If desired, a black comedy could be made from The Social Network.
Zuckerberg is obsessed with the idea of popularity and leadership, but what is more in his case - positive or negative?
And what social consequences will his invention entail?
Is he a scammer?
Or a cunning manipulator?
Fincher and Sorkin will never close the book if there is the slightest hint of something like that in it.
But here it is not even necessary: in their version of history it is not important at all.
"What is it like to feel beautiful?" is asked in the song "Vabu Wotse A Vsp Map" by Tre Veanez, which precedes the credits.
The hero doesn't know.
The film provides the answer.
Zuckerberg is a representative of the lost online generation, which has a weak understanding of beauty and even less of feelings.
A tastefully made drama about a high-profile trial of the Internet era
In the early 17th century, when Ivan Susanin lived, surnames of people of low origin had not yet really started to appear.
They were referred to as "such-and-such, son of such-and-such".
That is, patronymics were in use - nicknames based on the father's name.
But sometimes, for example in the case of a father's remarriage, the matronym - a nickname based on the mother's name - was used.
Susanna is just such a case: "Ivan, son of Susanna".
Serf owners of small estates really did manage without surnames for a long time - why bother with them when you have 20 people and they are all in plain sight.
But the owners of thousands of estates were forced to give their peasants surnames.
Thus, the serfs of Prince Andrei Cherkassky already had surnames in the early 18th century.
In the 19th century, even small landowners did not keep peasants on the land, but let them go to work for hire - let them earn a living and pay the landowner.
Such a peasant was entitled to a passport, in which the surname had to be entered.
In Central Russia, 55% of serfs were released on the condition of paying a tribute.
This means that they already had surnames.
Capital city criminalists have flown in to investigate the explosion in Novosibirsk
Criminalists from the central apparatus and staff from the forensic center have arrived in Novosibirsk to help with the investigation of the gas explosion in a house on Liniyaya, 39, reports NGS.
According to the investigation, the defendants, Irina Urbach and Evgeny Kavun, posing as employees of the fictitious organization "Interregional Gas", inspected and repaired gas equipment.
They used low-quality parts, worked carelessly, and, on the contrary, overcharged for their services, the agency reports, citing an informed source.
On the eve of the tragedy on the Line, a man and a woman visited three apartments in house No. 39, where they were changing the hoses of the stoves.
For example, in one of the apartments they installed a hose for water instead of a gas one.
Kavoun however denies this.
According to him, this is impossible, everything was certified.
As a result of their actions, a gas-air mixture leaked and exploded in one of the apartments.
Two entrances collapsed - one completely, the other partially.
This led to a significant collapse of the building, resulting in the deaths of 13 people.
Earlier, suspects in the case of the explosion of a house in Novosibirsk were arrested.
The scammers themselves came from Omsk.
In St. Petersburg, a marine flood was avoided
Arguments of the Week.

The specialists were able to prevent the flood thanks to the closure of the dam a day earlier.
On Friday, the threat of flooding in St. Petersburg increased sharply due to bad weather in the city.
The sea surge flood was prevented thanks to the timely closure of the dam.
The potential flood could be the 32nd, reports the St. Petersburg publication Nevada.Tudey.
The water level reached 184 centimeters, but thanks to the closure of the locks in the Gulf of Finland, the water held at 168 centimeters, which is only seven centimeters above the lower threshold of the dangerous flood level (from 161 to 210 centimeters).
Weather conditions were complicated by gusty winds, the speed of which sometimes reached 20-25 meters per second.
Now the dam has been reopened, the water level has dropped, and ships can once again sail through the Gulf of Finland.
Note that ten meteorological stations on the eastern side of the Gulf of Finland are monitoring the water level situation.
This helps prevent flooding that may follow the strengthening of the wind.
In Turkey, 8 people arrested in the case of defects in collapsed buildings
Eight people have been arrested in the Turkish province of Shanliurfa in connection with construction defects found in buildings that collapsed as a result of an earthquake.
As reported by Armenpress, this is reported by Habertürk.
As a result of the earthquake that occurred in Turkey on February 6, more than 20,000 people died.
The number of wounded exceeds 80 thousand.
It is noted that the earthquake is the strongest since 1939.
Hundreds of aftershocks followed the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.7, which were felt not only in 10 provinces of Turkey, but also in neighboring Syria.
Pashinyan sent congratulatory messages to the Supreme Leader of Iran and the President of the country
Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan sent congratulatory messages to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei, and the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ebrahim Raisi, on the occasion of the 44th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.
This was reported to Armenpress by the Department of Information and Public Relations of the Office of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia.
The message to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution of Iran, Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei, reads:

Caption to the video: WW2 bomb explosion in Great Yarmouth is caught on camera
In England, in the port city of Great Yarmouth, an air bomb from World War II exploded on Friday, which sappers were trying to defuse.
A powerful explosion was heard for dozens of kilometers, but there were no casualties.
The Norfolk County Police announced that, although the explosion was unplanned, no one from the military involved in defusing the bomb was injured.
"The device detonated shortly after work began on its neutralization.
Fortunately, the entire crew is safe.
The agencies have started assessing the damage," said Nick Davison, assistant to the chief of police in Norfolk, to journalists.
Local residents write on social networks that the explosion shook houses at a distance of 24 km.

A 250-kilogram bomb was found during construction work on the bank of the Yar River, at the mouth of which, on the coast of the North Sea, stands Great Yarmouth.
Before attempting to disarm the bomb, the sappers built a protective wall of sand around it, and a cordon, which kept outsiders at a distance of 200 meters, was set up.
The explosive experts first tried to cut the detonator off the bomb with the help of a robot on Thursday, but the attempt failed, and then they decided, as the local press writes, to use the "slow burning" technique to defuse the explosives.
During this burning process, an explosion occurred.
During World War II, the Nazis dropped hundreds of thousands of bombs on Britain.
During the eight-month intensive bombing campaign from autumn 1940 to spring 1941, known as "Blitz", 450,000 bombs were dropped on Britain.

According to a Republican public opinion monitoring conducted by the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences last year, the majority of Belarusians do not support gender stereotypes about women's opportunities in science.
63.5% (56.5% men and 69% women) disagree to some extent with the gender stereotype that science is a male domain.
More than half of the country's residents do not agree that a woman is less competent as a scientist - 66.1% (59% men and 71.6% women).
"The transformation of gender representations of women's research competence in the mass consciousness contributes to attracting young women to science, developing their creative potential, forming a successful role model of a woman scientist, including through the transfer of experience and the mentorship institution," noted Alesia Solovei.
February 11 is celebrated annually as International Day of Women and Girls in Science.
The holiday was established to introduce women and girls to the field of science, encourage women to pursue scientific careers, and recognize women's achievements in science.
According to UNESCO, women make up 30% of the total number of researchers in the world.
The probability of a further increase in the key rate is higher than its decrease
This statement was made by the Chairman of the Bank of Russia, Elvira Nabiullina, following the meeting of its Board of Directors on February 10, which decided to keep the rate at 7.50%.
The head of the regulator, in particular, noted that important changes have occurred recently.
On the one hand, the conditions of foreign trade have noticeably worsened - the prices of Russian oil have fallen.
On the other hand, the economic situation is better than the October forecast.
The shift in the structure of demand continues: consumption remains restrained, private investment slows down, but budgetary expenditures grow.
At the same time, overall inflationary risks have increased.
"Therefore, this year the probability of a rate hike exceeds the probability of a rate cut.
The appropriateness of changing the rate will be determined by the development of the situation," said E. Nabiullina.
In addition to the more pronounced impact of fiscal policy, it will note three risks.
First, a rapid acceleration in consumption in the face of heightened inflationary expectations, if the factors that restrain consumer activity weaken.
Secondly, the growing shortage of labor and the lag in productivity growth from wage growth.
And there are still risks of additional tightening of sanctions restrictions.
Speaking about the regulator's future decisions, the Chairman of the Bank of Russia noted that, despite the earlier noted strengthening of pro-inflationary factors, the inflation forecast for the current year remains at 5 - 7%.
According to her, this may require a higher trajectory of the key rate than was assumed in October.
In the updated forecast of the Central Bank for this and the next year, the ranges for the average key rate have been raised by half a percentage point, to 7.0-9.0% per annum for 2023 and 6.5 - 7.5% per annum for 2024.
"This does not rule out the possibility of a rate cut this year, but its probability and scale have decreased.
On the contrary, the likelihood has increased that some increase in the rate may be needed in 2024 to ensure that inflation is close to the 4% target," the head of the Bank of Russia concluded.
The Bank of Russia has approved the requirements for the procedure for creating special closed-end mutual investment funds (PIF) consisting of blocked foreign securities.
The regulator informs that such securities will be withdrawn from the composition of existing retail mutual funds.
This will allow the management of remaining liquid assets to be launched and investment share operations to be resumed.
If more than 10% of the retail PIF is made up of locked-in securities, the management company must allocate them to a separate closed PIF by September 1, 2023.
Each shareholder will be issued shares of the new fund in an amount equal to the shares of the main fund.
It is also possible to change the status of the retail fund to closed.
For funds with less than 10% of locked-in securities, the new requirements are not mandatory.
But the management company has the right to allocate blocked assets into a separate closed mutual fund.
In addition, there is a requirement to inform shareholders about the consequences of withdrawing blocked securities into a special mutual fund.
In the future, if such securities are issued, management companies are required to pay at least 90% of the proceeds to the owners of investment shares on a quarterly basis, according to a statement from the Bank of Russia.
In addition to summarizing the industry, experts also gave a forecast for the current year.
According to the Center for Analysis and Expertise of Promsvyazbank, in 2022, passenger traffic on air transport in Russia decreased by 6.3%, and passenger transportation decreased by 14.2%.
The volume of passenger traffic amounted to 95.2 million people, and passenger turnover was 228.0 billion passenger-kilometers.
International passenger traffic amounted to 17.2 million people, which is 26.7% lower than the previous year, and domestic traffic amounted to 78.0 million people (-10.9%).
PSB analysts note that the industry's relative stability was influenced by government support programs.
In 2022, a program to stimulate domestic tourism was in effect, which was allocated 38.8 billion rubles.
Tourists could receive a partial refund for tours with flights prepared by Rosturizm.
Several state support programs were also implemented to ensure the availability of air transportation, including subsidies for passenger transportation, the development of regional transportation, etc., with a total budget of more than 27.5 billion rubles.
In the second quarter of 2022, the government decided to allocate an additional 100 billion rubles to airlines and to recapitalize Aeroflot by 52.5 billion rubles.
"Despite the sanction pressure on the Russian aviation industry, as a result of the development of domestic tourism and the opening of new international destinations, as well as the continuation of state subsidies to the industry (so far 25.3 billion rubles have been allocated), in 2023, passenger traffic is expected to increase by 6.4%, to 101.2 million people (domestic passenger traffic will amount to 91.1 million people), according to the forecast of Rosaviation, to 103.0 million people," share the forecasts of PSB analysts.
Terrorist attack in Jerusalem, a 6-year-old child died
Two people, including a 6-year-old child, were victims of a terrorist attack in Jerusalem: a car at high speed crashed into a bus stop.
Another six people were injured.
The driver of the car was shot dead on the spot.
Later it was revealed that the man was a 31-year-old Palestinian from East Jerusalem.
His actions were classified by law enforcement agencies as a terrorist attack, the terrorist's relatives were detained, and the house was sealed.
At the same time, according to Israeli media reports, the attacker had mental health problems, and was only discharged from hospital this week.
Austria is tightening border controls with Hungary again after another influx of migrants in recent months.
Officials say many people are staying in their cars at the border waiting to cross into Austria.
This way, it becomes a signal to the Austrian authorities that they have already gone through the asylum procedure in Hungary.
Based on existing agreements, Austria believes that migrants must remain in the country where the request was made.
At the same time, the Austrian authorities consider it wrong to automatically send back to Hungary those who want to cross the border: many migrants become victims of smugglers and find themselves between two border posts without the right to return to Hungary.
That is why, according to the police, there is a need for increased control.
The decision to tighten checks by Vienna followed a pledge by European Union leaders to allocate more funds for cameras, drones and watchtowers to guard the bloc's borders.
According to Frontex, the number of illegal migrants who arrived in the EU and applied for refugee status exceeded the 2016 figures for the first time last year, reaching more than 330,000.
Cargo ship "Progress 83" successfully docked with the ISS
The automatic supply ship Progress 83 successfully docked with the International Space Station on Saturday at 3.45 GMT, completing a two-day orbital flight.
The docking occurred at an altitude of 269 statute miles above the southern part of the Pacific Ocean.
The NASA Flight Control Center in Houston, Texas, broadcast the docking.
In Russia, the docking was controlled by specialists from the Flight Control Center.
From the ISS, the cargo ship was greeted by cosmonauts Sergei Prokopiev, Dmitry Petelin, and Anna Kikina.
The Progress MS-22 spacecraft delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS, including 720 kg of refueling fuel, 420 kg of water, and about 1,354 kg of dry cargo.
In addition, the ship delivered food for the Russian cosmonauts.
Progress 83 successfully launched from the Russian Baikonur cosmodrome on Thursday.
At the same time, Roscosmos reported the depressurization of the Progress MS-21, which was prepared for separation from the ISS and further drowning on February 18.
As specified in the press service of the company, the ship's transition hatch was immediately closed: "Progress MS-21" is isolated from the general volume of the ISS.
The reasons for its depressurization are being investigated."
The ISS also reported that the crew of the ISS is not in danger: "The temperature regime and pressure on board the station are normal.
There is no threat to the crew's life and health, they are in good health."
"There have been more cases of birth tourism."
How pregnant Russian women got stuck in Argentina
The Migration Service of Argentina has begun to suspend and cancel the residence permits of Russians who received them through the birth of a child but did not remain in the country.
Earlier, the authorities of the republic denied entry to the country to several pregnant Russian women, who were suspected of having come for the purpose of "maternity tourism".
On February 11, they were still allowed into Argentina by a court decision.
Read more in the article "Gazeta.Ru".
The Migration Service of Argentina has begun to suspend and cancel the residence permits (VNJ) of Russians who received them through the birth of a child, but did not remain in the country.
This was reported to the C5N television channel by the director of the service, Florencia Carignano.
"What we are doing is suspending the residence permits of those Russians who came to get a residence permit because their child is Argentinean, but who have spent more time outside (Argentina) than inside (the country)," she explained.
According to her, when the issue of Argentine citizenship for a Russian citizen is considered in court, the migration service will submit data that the residence permit was suspended because this person "spent a month in Argentina and never came back."
Carignano warned that Russians who received a residence permit after the birth of a child and left the country may have it revoked.
Against this backdrop, on February 9 it was reported that three pregnant Russian women were "stuck" at an airport in Argentina due to a refusal of entry into the country.
According to the head of the consular department of the Russian embassy in Argentina, Georgy Polin, the diplomatic mission links the incident with the fact that the authorities of the republic may have considered the information provided by the girls upon entry to be incomplete or false.
One of them arrived on February 7, and two more on the evening of February 8, reports RIA Novosti.
The diplomat emphasized that more pregnant women flew to Argentina, but these three were specifically issued a decree prohibiting them from entering the country.
"They were not allowed into the country in accordance with the migration law, where one of the grounds for not allowing them into the country is providing incomplete, false, or distorted information," Polin said.
On Saturday, February 11, the migration service of Argentina, by a decision of the court, allowed pregnant citizens of the Russian Federation to enter the country, said the lawyer Christian Rubilar.
"An hour ago, they all were allowed to enter Argentina," TASS quotes him as saying.
Rubilar noted that the migration service changed its decision after the court ruling.
It is easier for foreign parents of a child born in Argentina to obtain a passport of the Republic.
It allows for short-term travel to 171 countries without visas, including EU states, the UK, and Japan, notes RBC.
In early January 2023, The Guardian wrote about a "boom in maternity tourism" to Argentina among Russians.
According to Polina, between 2,000 and 2,500 Russian citizens moved to the republic in 2022.
Many of them, the diplomat noted, are Russian women who are planning to give birth there.
"In 2023, this number could grow to 10 thousand," he said.
In turn, Carignano previously stated that in 2022, about 10,500 Russian citizens arrived in Argentina, and in recent months, more than 5,800 pregnant women.
On February 9, it became known how the rental prices for housing in St. Petersburg changed.
It has fallen by 10%.
It is known that across the country, rents have increased by 25%, reports Patrol Petersburg, citing RBC.
The average monthly rent for an apartment in St. Petersburg at the beginning of 2023 was 27,000 rubles.
A one-bedroom apartment cost 25,000 rubles per month, a studio apartment cost 22,000 rubles per month, and a two-bedroom apartment cost 36,000 rubles per month.
Experts believe that this trend could change as early as spring, when many citizens who have been abroad return home.
The reasons for questioning women in a foreign country have become known.
The immigration service of Argentina did not let six pregnant Russian women into the country, as the purpose of their visit, which they had indicated, turned out to be false.
This was reported by TASS, citing the Todo Noticias television channel.
For five hours, pregnant women were asked questions about the purpose of their visit.
Most of them admitted that they came to a foreign country to give birth.
In this regard, the country's representatives did not let Russian women into Argentina.
As specified in the publication, the migration service has a procedure for action if there are suspicions about "false" travelers.
For example, if it is noticeable that a woman is in the 33rd week of pregnancy, she does not have a return ticket to Russia, and she cannot clearly say where she will go on vacation, then suspicion immediately falls on her from the migration service.
Moreover, the specialists clarify that it is difficult to be a traveler "in such conditions".
The artist's decision to leave the theater was planned.
State Prize laureate Alexander Filippenko said that the decision of the Moscow City Council not to renew his contract was planned, and that everything was agreed upon in advance with the management.
He spoke about this in an interview with the Interfax agency.
In the productions in which he took part, the artists from the second cast were invited.
The People's Artist of the Russian Federation clarified that his contract ended in 2022.
All the details have long been agreed upon with the theater's representatives.
Moreover, everyone knew that the star was not going to renew the contract.
Filippenkov noted that the authorities agreed and prepared all the documents.
So, he assures that "he did not let anyone down".
In addition, it was reported that the artist emigrated from Russia.
He flew to his heir in Latvia.
Filipenko is going to undergo "long-term treatment" in a foreign country.
As stated in the publication, at the moment the film actor is working in a Moscow theater as a guest actor.
According to the publication, the artist played in the Moscow City Council in such performances as "Shakespeare's Hamlet" and "The Taming of the Shrew", "Uncle Vanya", as well as "Three Sisters".
From the private sector territories in Kaliningrad Oblast on Friday, February 10, 340 thousand cubic meters of snow were removed.
This information was shared by the city hall.
At the moment, there are more than four hundred streets in the Kalininsky district of the private sector, from which snow must be removed by spring.
The roads will be cleaned in two stages.
The first will end on February 15th, and the second will run from March 1st to April 15th.
114 pieces of special equipment and 123 workers will take part in the clean-up.
Authorities said that contractors are facing snow removal on the roadway by residents of the houses.
Kirkorov won the case against the fisherman
In the lawsuit, the man claimed that the artist's construction was illegal, but he did not appear at the hearing.
The fisherman sued the musician Philip Kirkorov over an allegedly illegally installed pier on his suburban dacha.
This is reported by Channel 5.
However, the Saratov fisherman was not able to win the case.
The complaint against the singer was considered by the Odintsovo City Court. According to the lawyer, documents and design projects were presented in court, which confirmed the legality of all the structures installed on the celebrity's property.
As the head of the law firm, Alexander Dobrovskoy, clarifies, the construction of the pier did not leave the plaintiff with any chance to go fishing.
The application for the performer was filed on January 11.
The star lawyer joked that the man probably planned to fish exclusively from the artist's home.
Ironically, Dobrovinsky clarified that he would ask Kirkorov to provide the plaintiff with his balcony for fishing.
He emphasized that from that location it is possible to continue casting with a spinning rod.
A sleep specialist has named the causes of sleep problems
Sleep specialist Sofia Cherkasova spoke about foods and habits that interfere with healthy sleep.
As the specialist noted, sleep problems often occur due to products containing caffeine.
This primarily refers to tea, coffee, chocolate, and any desserts containing cocoa.
Their use before bed should be limited, as they not only interfere with sleep, but also make sleep "jumpy", which means that the body does not have the opportunity to fully recover.
According to the doctor, it is best to stop consuming caffeine-containing products 6-8 hours before bedtime.
Otherwise, they contribute to a decrease in the threshold of excitability of the nervous system and, as a result, difficulties with falling asleep occur.
Alcohol negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
The doctor clarifies that small doses of alcoholic beverages promote relaxation and do not affect sleep.
However, quantities exceeding 36 grams in terms of pure alcohol lead to various sleep disturbances, such as superficial sleep and frequent nighttime awakenings.
In addition, to prevent sleep problems, a somnologist recommends avoiding spicy foods and large portions.
Large volumes and spicy food contribute to an increase in body temperature, which negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
For healthy sleep, it is not only necessary to maintain an external temperature regime: an optimal temperature is 18-20 degrees Celsius - but also the absence of elevated body temperature.
According to Cherkasova, it is not worth abusing heavy foods before bedtime, as it will not allow the body to fully recover and rest: it will have to spend its energy on digestion.
The doctor also reminded that the lack of healthy sleep and accumulated sleep deprivation affect the quality of life and habitual activities, so it is extremely important to stick to a sleep and rest schedule and allow the body to recover.
Bloomberg named the name of Trump's competitor in the upcoming presidential elections: In the world: Politics: INFOX.ru
According to the agency, the main competitor of the former president in the upcoming elections will be the governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis.
Desantis, a Republican, has not yet officially announced his intention to run for the presidency, but Bloomberg sources report that he is already preparing for the primaries.
According to the agency, Desantis' team is already recruiting consultants to participate in the presidential elections and conducting preliminary polls.
Bloomberg reports that a planned off-site meeting for Republican Party leaders and government officials is scheduled for the end of February.
The agency reports that the team of the governor of Florida is seeking support among Republican colleagues from Iowa, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and other states. Bloomberg experts named Desantis as the main potential competitor of Donald Trump.
Experts consider the current governor of Florida to be well-known enough that he does not need to start a campaign right now, and they also note his ability to raise money.
Ron Desantis was a supporter of Donald Trump's candidacy for the presidency in 2017, and he may compete with him in the presidential elections in November 2024.
Donald Trump officially announced his intention to run for president "to make America great again"... during a speech to his supporters in Florida.
The current president, Joe Biden, despite assurances from his team about his intention to participate in the 60th presidential election, announced the lack of a firm decision on this issue.
Hundreds of demonstrations against the pension reform will take place in France on Saturday
The fourth day of mass protests against the pension reform is being held by trade unions in France on Saturday.
Hundreds of demonstrations will take place across the country, French media report.
After a slight decrease in the number of participants in protest actions on Tuesday compared to the first two "days of mobilization", the unions hope to bring more protesters out onto the streets this time, taking into account those citizens who were unable to participate in the demonstrations on a weekday.
Law enforcement agencies expect between 600,000 and 800,000 demonstrators across the country, including 90,000 to 120,000 in Paris, according to media reports.
On February 7, 757,000 people took part in protests against the pension reform, according to the French Ministry of the Interior.
The largest trade union association, the General Confederation of Labour (GCL), reported 2 million protesters.
According to the VKT, 400,000 demonstrators took to the streets of Paris on Tuesday.
The police say there were 57 thousand of them.
On the previous day of protests, January 31, the number of demonstrators was estimated by the police at 1.27 million and 2.8 million by trade unions.
The next mass protests are planned for February 16.
As reported, on January 10, French Prime Minister Elisabeth Born presented the government's draft pension reform project, which provides for increasing the retirement age from 62 to 64 years.
It is expected that the retirement age threshold will gradually shift from 62 years to 64 years by three months per year, and this process will last until 2030.
The new regime will apply to French people born in September 1961 or after.
French President Emmanuel Macron stated during the 2022 election campaign that he was determined to carry out pension reform before the end of his second presidential term.
On February 6, the French National Assembly began consideration of the government's draft pension reform.

The depressurization of the Progress MS-21 occurred on the ISS: February 12, 2023, 00:12
TASS - KAZINFOCOM - Roscosmos reported the depressurization of the Progress MS-21, prepared for separation from the ISS, reports MIA "Kazinform" with reference to TASS.
"The contour of the Progress MS-21 transport cargo ship, the flooding of which is planned for February 18, has been depressurized, confirmed data from telemetry received at the Mission Control Center," the Roscosmos press service reported.
As noted, at the moment it is isolated from the overall volume of the station.
The causes of the incident are being investigated, and it did not affect the docking of the Progress MS-22 cargo ship or the further flight program of the ISS.
The situation was commented on by the Executive Director of Roscosmos for manned space programs, Sergei Krikalev.
"A cargo ship, which has been docked at the station for several months, has suffered a leak of coolant from the thermoregulation system.
The situation is somewhat similar to what happened to us with the ship ("Soyuz MS-22" - TASS) in mid-December," he said, noting that the commission that analyzed the incident with "Soyuz" concluded that the leak was caused by a micrometeoroid.
Roscosmos will conduct an analysis to ensure that there are no problems with the next launches.
"We need to conduct a thorough analysis to make sure that this cause does not apply to similar designs in future launches.
This is the most important task that will now be before us," he said.
According to the CEO, an analysis will be conducted in terms of preparing the ship for launch, the materials used, and the technologies used in the assembly of the radiator.
The same analysis was carried out in the case of the damaged radiator of the Soyuz MS-22 spacecraft.
"The most important thing is to make sure that this is not some kind of systematic error," added Krikalev.
The CEO clarified that a commission began work on Saturday to analyze all possible causes.
"The ship was scheduled to be disconnected and deorbited two days before the launch of the Soyuz spacecraft (Soyuz MS-23 - TASS), so there will be no serious consequences for the crew's actions, for the crew's work... From this point of view, this will not affect the program," said Krikalev.
The Progress MS-21 cargo vehicle was launched from Baikonur on a Soyuz-2.1a carrier rocket on October 26.
Two days later, it docked with the small research module "Search" of the Russian segment of the ISS.
The ship delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS.
NASA has named the place of the "Progress" depressurization
The depressurization of the Progress MS-21 cargo ship at the International Space Station (ISS) occurred in the thermal control system.
This was reported by a representative of the American Mission Control Center (MCC) during negotiations with the ISS crew, broadcast by NASA.
Now, according to NASA, the coolant leak from Progress has stopped.
NASA believes that all the refrigerant has completely leaked out.
"This morning we had a leak of refrigerant from the thermal control system into space, the refrigerant leak has stopped," said a representative of the American Mission Control Center (quoted by Interfax).
Earlier, the "Progress" module was isolated due to a leak.
Roscosmos reported that nothing threatens the cosmonauts.
Progress MS-22 docked with the ISS today, February 11, and it will be deorbited on February 18, according to the plan.
The coordinator of strategic communications at the US National Security Council, John Kirby, declined to announce a possible trip of US President Joe Biden to Ukraine.
He told reporters about this at a briefing, which was broadcast on the White House YouTube channel.
Kirby noted that he "has nothing to announce about additional points of the American leader's trip" to Poland.
On the eve, White House Press Secretary Karin Jean-Pierre announced Biden's visit to Poland from February 20 to 22.
According to a statement from the administration, during the trip, the US president will discuss bilateral cooperation with the Polish leadership, as well as joint efforts to support Ukraine and strengthen NATO's deterrence capabilities.
Kirby said earlier that Biden will visit Ukraine when the time is right, but now is not the time for official visits.
Fitness expert talks about winter outdoor workouts to lose weight
A fitness expert has called walking in winter an excellent way to lose weight without intense exercise
Fitness expert Anthony Young spoke about effective interval training on the street to lose weight.
His words are quoted by the Eat This, Not That portal.
The specialist called active walks in winter an excellent way to lose weight without intense exercise, as well as to improve the condition of the cardiovascular system and psychological health.
"The first five to ten minutes, walk at a normal pace to warm up your body and joints.
Then, for one minute, walk as fast as you can, without running.
One minute - at normal speed," explains Eng.
Three approaches are necessary.
Next, the specialist advises doing lunges or squats with weights for 15 seconds, followed by walking at a comfortable pace for another 45 seconds.
This sequence should be repeated five times. Then, Yeng suggests alternating an active step (two minutes) and a calm step (one minute) three more times.
The walk should be concluded with a five-minute walk at a calm pace and a few stretching exercises.
All in all, this workout will take 35 minutes in the fresh air.
Earlier, the master of sports in athletics Maxim Babenkov-Kudryavtsev gave advice on choosing equipment for winter runs in a commentary for Lenta.ru.
"You will need thermal underwear, moisture-wicking clothing, special lightweight, but warm headwear.
Running shoes for winter are different because they have denser materials, a higher platform, and a sole protector," the athlete said.
On February 17, a creative evening of the Orthodox writer, historian, screenwriter, and member of the Russian Union of Writers will take place at the CDL.
The evening will be attended by writers, screenwriters, and scientists.

The head of Serpukhov checked the condition of the apartment buildings
The head of the city of Serpukhov, Sergei Nikitenko, conducted a working tour of the territories.
Together with representatives of management organizations, he inspected the contents of apartment buildings and residential buildings.
The addresses from which the most appeals were received from residents were found to be under the strictest control.
- Many of the comments are quite justified and relate primarily to the cleaning of entrances and the maintenance of common areas.
The people of Serpukhov themselves are not standing idly by and are actively fighting the problem of vandalism, especially the widespread problem of graffiti.
We will work on the issue with the "Safe Region" cameras in mind, said the head of the municipality, Sergei Nikitenko.
Attention was also paid to the replacement of mailboxes, light bulbs, the installation of wires in boxes, and the late removal of garbage from container areas.
The management companies must solve all the tasks set before them as soon as possible.
The Deputy Managing Director of RZD suggested that the Governor of the Irkutsk Region should develop new sales channels
The Irkutsk region needs to continue to explore alternative sales markets, in addition to the Far East.
This includes the domestic market and the ports of the Western direction, including the Azov-Black Sea basin.
This proposal was made by the deputy general director of RZD, Alexei Shilo, at a meeting with the governor, Igor Kobzev, reports the regional government on February 10, 2023.
- As practice showed last year, even despite the geographical location of the Irkutsk region, this decision can be extremely effective.
It is important that logistics services of companies constantly interact with our "neighbors" (ports, operators, maritime transport) and find optimal pricing conditions for transporting their products under new schemes, - emphasized Alexey Shilo.
The governor noted the importance of stable product shipments, Irkutsk region is one of the richest regions in mineral resources in the Russian Federation and has significant reserves of coal and brown coal.
About 25 enterprises are engaged in coal mining in the region.
The instability of exports has a negative impact on the financial and economic activities of coal mining companies.
Igor Kobzev also emphasized that the Irkutsk region is an export-oriented region, so it is necessary to increase the size of monthly quotas for the transportation of timber and metallurgical products produced in the region to a level that ensures the stable operation of such enterprises.
- Understanding the importance of the Irkutsk region as an industrial center, we, for our part, will try to do everything to support the volume of transportation.
If additional volumes of shipments to the domestic market appear, we are also ready to provide assistance in this direction, said Alexey Shilo.
Konstantin Zaitsev met with the active citizens of the villages of Granovshchina and Khomutovo
At the request of the head of the region, Igor Kobzev, the Chairman of the Government of the Priangarye Region, Konstantin Zaitsev, worked in the villages of Granovshchina and Khomutovo of the Irkutsk region today.

In addition, a regional subsidy was allocated for the purchase of equipment in the amount of 64.2 million rubles.
After the opening, in addition to the children from the village of Granovshchina, the children from the Urikovskaya school, which was undergoing repairs, also took part.
The classes are taught by more than 100 teachers, of which almost 90 are subject teachers.
In 2022, the school was allocated a bus purchased by the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation under the federal program.
The capital repair of Khomutovskaya Secondary School No. 2 began in 2022.
The first-graders were distributed to Homutovskaya School No. 1, and the older students are studying in the second building of School No. 2.
According to the renovation plan, the roof, engineering communications, windows and related elements will be replaced, the facade will be repaired, and the interior of the premises will be renovated.
An important component of the repair is the reconstruction of the heating point with water heating, which was replaced with dry heat.
The cost of all the work is more than 80 million rubles.
Repairs are in the final stages, there are problems with connecting to the power grid - an increase in capacity is needed, work is being done with the power supply organization.
In addition, in Granovshchina and Khomutovo, Konstantin Zaitsev met with citizens, some of whom had their homes illegally connected to the electrical grid by developers.
It was decided that the network company will organize a personal reception next week to resolve these issues legally.
- Very often, the issue of stable electricity supply is the main condition when buying a house, because the population is increasingly using electric energy for heating.
Therefore, sellers sometimes illegally connect homes to nearby networks, and this is already a reason for disconnection of electricity supply.
Therefore, network companies in those territories where active construction is underway should pay special attention to this issue, emphasized Konstantin Zaitsev.
Anatoly Prokopiev assessed the effectiveness of state support measures for peasant-farming enterprises in the Ural Federal District
The head of the UBOO Anatoly Prokopiev visited three family farms in the Ekhirit-Bulagatsky district today.
The head of the family farm in the village of Kapsal, Yulia Madaeva, received a grant for the development of her farm as a beginner farmer in 2014.
One of the main areas of the farm's activity is the production of livestock products.
The number of livestock is increasing every year and the gross production of meat and milk is increasing.
Later, thanks to state support, it became possible in 2019 to participate and win a grant in the form of subsidies for the development of a family dairy farm.
Today, the cattle population in the farm is about 150 heads, 60 of which are cows.
In addition, they are engaged in the cultivation of cereal crops, and they sow annual forage crops.
Thanks to the activities of the KFH of Viktor Katanayev, the area of Kharyashino in the village of Kulunkun has been reclassified as a populated area.
The farm is engaged in the breeding and fattening of dairy cattle.
In 2014, a grant was received for the development of a family dairy cattle farm with 60 heads.
Today, the farm has a herd of 150 cattle.
Potatoes have also been grown here for many years.
The head of the family farm tries to create all the necessary conditions for the team to work and live.
Now there is an entire village on the farm.
Anatoly Prokopiev has taken personal control of the issue of building two km of road from the area of Kharyashino to Ust-Ordynsky.
The main activities of the Stalin Mogzoeva family farm in the village of Otonhoi are the breeding of cattle and buffaloes.
In 2020, the farm participated in the selection process and received a grant from AGROSTARTUP for the development of a meat-focused farming business.
With these funds, a tractor trailer, two press pickers, and a mower were purchased.
The head of the farm increases the number of livestock every year and increases the gross production of meat.
In addition, the KFH sows annual forage crops on an area of 40 hectares.
In Stalin's plans, Mogzoeva was to open a feeding area.
After visiting three farms, the head of the district noted that state support measures are effective, necessary, and necessary.
- The government of the Irkutsk region pays great attention to agriculture.
Therefore, state support should not only be maintained, but also increased and improved.
We, in turn, must be the guarantor of food security.
Agricultural producers in the district are honoring this role, - emphasized Anatoly Prokopiev.
The border between Armenia and Turkey was opened for the first time in decades to deliver humanitarian aid
The Margar-Alijan border crossing on the border of Turkey and Armenia was opened for the first time in three decades to deliver humanitarian aid to those affected by the earthquake.
This is being reported by Turkish and Armenian media.
The same crossing was used to deliver humanitarian aid from Turkey to Armenia after the devastating earthquake of 1988, notes the Turkish agency "Anadolu".
On Saturday, Armenia sent five trucks with 100 tons of food, medicines, water, and other emergency aid packages to the city of Adiyaman in southern Turkey, said Serdar Kılıç, the special envoy of Ankara in the Armenian-Turkish negotiations.
He expressed his gratitude to the Vice Speaker of the Parliament of Armenia Ruben Rubinyan and the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Armenia Vahan Kostanyan.
"I will always remember the help provided by the people of Armenia to alleviate the suffering of our people in the earthquake-stricken region," Kılıç wrote on his Twitter page.
The press secretary of the Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Vahan Unanyan, in turn, reported that trucks with humanitarian aid crossed the border through the Margara bridge and are heading to the earthquake-stricken region.
According to Public Radio of Armenia, the last time the car crossed the Margahar Bridge was 30 years ago, in 1993.
Since then, the Armenian-Turkish land border has been closed.
The Turkish agency "Anadolu" cites other data and writes that the border point of Margara-Alijan was last used to deliver humanitarian goods to Armenia to address the aftermath of the devastating earthquake of 1988.
Then, aid collected through the Turkish Red Crescent was sent to the disaster zone in Armenia.
Earlier, Armenia sent 27 rescuers to Turkey and another 29 rescuers to Syria to help the areas affected by the earthquake.
According to the latest data, more than 25 thousand people have died in Turkey and Syria from the devastating earthquake that occurred on Monday.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on February 11 that 21,848 people have died in Turkey.
The Syrian side reported 3,553 dead.
Relations between Turkey and Armenia are mainly clouded by Ankara's refusal to recognize the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire, as well as its support for Baku during the First and Second Karabakh Wars.
Recently, Yerevan and Ankara have made several attempts to normalize relations.
In 2021, Armenia and Turkey appointed special representatives who met several times in Vienna to discuss issues of normalization.
In February 2022, commercial air traffic between Yerevan and Istanbul resumed after a two-year hiatus.
In July 2022, Ankara and Yerevan agreed to open the land border for citizens of third countries as soon as possible.

Russian mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter Islam Makachev received a prestigious award from the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), becoming the winner of the "Submission of the Year" award for his early victory over Brazilian Charles Oliveira.
"Submission of the Year".

If you need him to play in the position of Makélélé, he can play there very well.

The match will start at 22.00 Moscow time, and a live broadcast at 21.55 Moscow time will be shown on the matchtv.ru website and the Match! Football 2 TV channel.
Analysts at the bookmaker company BETCITY consider the "blancos" huge favorites: you can bet on Real Madrid winning in regular time with a coefficient of 1.28, with a probability of about 77%.
The success of the nominal guests is available for 11.0 (8%).

You can bet on the triumph of the Madrid team with extra time and a penalty shootout for 1.14, this market on Al-Hilal is going for 5.80.
The team from Saudi Arabia has overcome two rounds on its way to the final, beating Moroccan "Widad" in a penalty shootout and Brazilian "Flamengo" in regular time (3:2).

Guberniev spoke about the fact that midfielder Pavel Mamaev has made the decision to end his playing career.
Famous TV commentator Dmitry Guberniev spoke about the fact that midfielder Pavel Mamaev has made the decision to end his playing career.
"Now it will be possible to cast a bust in the hero's homeland.
He made a big mistake and for most people he will be remembered not as a footballer, but as a rule-breaking footballer.
But he is still far from Kokorin.
Because no one could have exploited their potential as well as Kokorin.
Despite all his talents, Mamaev was periodically noticeable.
I can only wish him good luck and let him realize himself somewhere else," Metaratings.ru quotes Guberniev.
The last club of the 34-year-old midfielder was Khimki.
The suburban club did not extend the contract with the midfielder in the summer of 2022.
Mamayev previously played for Torpedo, CSKA, Krasnodar, and Rostov.
Mamayev is the Russian champion, three-time winner of the Russian Cup and two-time winner of the country's Super Cup with CSKA.

A tanker with a diesel engine that previously sailed under the Russian flag was not allowed into the port of Spain
The Tarragona Naval Command of the Main Office of the Commercial Fleet under the Ministry of Transport of Spain has prohibited the entry of the Maersk Magellan vessel into the port of the city for the unloading of diesel fuel, since the cargo comes from the Nobel vessel, which until July 1, 2022, sailed under the Russian flag, the Spanish Ministry of Transport reported.
"The Maritime Command of Tarragona of the Main Office of the Commercial Fleet under the Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Development has prohibited the entry into the port of Tarragona for the unloading of diesel fuel on the vessel "Maersk Magellan" under the flag of Singapore, because the cargo it carries comes from the vessel under the Cameroonian flag "Nobel", which until July 1, 2022, sailed under the Russian flag," the ministry said in a statement.
The measure was adopted in accordance with European Union legislation, which prohibits access for any vessel registered under the Russian flag from April 16, 2022, or that has changed its flag after February 24, 2022.
The ministry clarified that the inspection was carried out on February 9, after which the ban was agreed upon.
The ministry recalled that this is not the first time that ships have been prohibited from entering Spanish ports.
In April 2022, the Black Star ship under the Maltese flag, which was carrying cargo from a ship under the Russian flag, was denied access to the port of Barcelona.
In 2022, after the EU, the US, and the UK strengthened their anti-Russian sanctions, they imposed restrictions on the supply of Russian oil products, and then decided to limit fuel prices.
Since December 5, 2022, a price ceiling on sea shipments of oil from the Russian Federation has been introduced by hostile countries.
At that time, the ceiling for Russian oil was set at $60/barrel.
Also, since December 5, the EU has imposed an embargo on sea shipments of oil from Russia.
The problems that pregnant Russian women have had with entering Argentina have been explained
According to the expert, against the backdrop of a surge in the number of people wanting to have children in Argentina, the country's authorities have become more attentive to the entry of foreign citizens into their territory.
The difficulties with the entry of pregnant Russian women into Argentina are due to the fact that the country's authorities are not interested in a mass influx of foreigners who want to obtain citizenship for their children and a residence permit for themselves, and then leave.
This is reported by Lenta.ru, citing SPbGU Professor Viktor Heifetz, editor-in-chief of the magazine Latin America.
According to him, no country supports such a practice.
He noted that Argentina does not approve of the country being turned into a transit point, rather than a final destination.
This applies to those who violate constitutional practice.
As the expert explained, the child will retain Argentine citizenship, but the court will decide whether to grant Argentine passports to the parents after they have obtained a residence permit.
If it is found that they did not actually live in Argentina and immediately left, citizenship may be denied.
This applies not only to Russians, but also to citizens of other countries.
Recently, as the specialist pointed out, maternity tours to Argentina are particularly popular among Russians and Ukrainians.
Recall that Argentina grants citizenship by "right of soil", that is, if a person was born on its territory.
The Argentine passport opens up the possibility of visa-free travel to 170 countries, including EU states and the UK.
Earlier it was reported that Argentina had begun to revoke residence permits for Russians who had received the document through the birth of a child, but had left the country.
Buenos Aires is interested in reducing such cases.
It was also reported that six pregnant Russian citizens were denied entry to Argentina due to suspicion of providing false information about the purpose of their trip.
In Russia, the opening of hundreds of new fitness clubs is expected
In Russia, citizens are regaining interest in fitness services, which allows market participants to expand their business.
This year, more than 400 new facilities, primarily small-format ones, may open in the country.
About 400 new fitness clubs may open in Russia, and their total number may increase by 5 percent.
According to "Kommersant", several dozen players may leave the Russian market.
By the end of the year, there will be about 8,600 clubs in Russia.
According to the publication, most of the new clubs are small-format projects with small initial investments and quick payback.
Such data is provided by representatives of the National Fitness Community.
President of the Association of Fitness Industry Operators Olga Kiseleva noted in an interview with the publication that 340-420 new fitness clubs will be small, while the rest will occupy an area of more than 500 square meters.
NFS President Elena Silina noted that since 2020, there have been more closures of clubs than openings every year.
Over the past three years, their number has decreased by 37 percent.
Independent analysts, however, cite different figures.
According to Kontur.Focus, over the past three years, the number of organizations with the main type of activity "work of a fitness center" has grown by 10.1 percent, and now there are 5,120 of them.
The industry suffered heavy losses due to the pandemic, but it began to recover in 2021.
According to 2GIS, there are 4,500 fitness clubs in Russian cities with a population of over a million.
Russians have started paying more attention to physical activity, as evidenced by the increase in the number of people visiting fitness clubs.
As of January 2023, attendance increased by 9.3 percent year over year.
As Silina noted, if the trend continues, the industry will return to pre-crisis levels by the end of the year.
The license of a management company from Kirov was revoked
The Arbitration Court of the Kirov Region has annulled the license for the management of multi-apartment buildings issued to the management company "Zabota".
In the Kirov region, the regional Arbitration Court has annulled the license for the management of apartment buildings previously issued to the management company "Zabota".
According to the regional State Housing Inspectorate, the court decision was made back in November 2022, but it only came into legal force in February 2023.
The arbitration panel revoked the "managing company"'s license for several instances of ignoring the requirements of the State Housing Inspectorate.
Currently, all the facilities that were under the management of "Zabota" have been excluded from the register of licenses for the conduct of business activities in the management of apartment buildings.
Their total area was 64.8 thousand square meters.
All the houses are located in the regional center.
The administration of Kirov knows that they have been left without a management company.
In accordance with the requirements of Russian law, the State Housing Inspectorate informed the mayor about the situation.
In January 2023, the governor of the Kirov region, Alexander Sokolov, set a task for the staff of the State Housing Inspectorate to eliminate two-thirds of the region's management companies by spring, as there are too many of them.
The legality of the governor's demands has caused doubts among the communists in Kirov.
They turned to the regional prosecutor's office and asked to hold Sokolov accountable.
Presumably, the same position could be taken by the Federal Antimonopoly Service.
The antimonopoly authorities also asked the prosecutor's office to check the legality of the actions of the regional head.
Wildberries will make parcel pick-up points payable
The Wildberries marketplace will make package pick-up points paid from February 13.
Their cost will range from 6 to 15 rubles.
Now, the packages are provided by the owners of the order pickup points.
If they are not present, a fine is imposed.
Starting Monday, February 13, it will no longer be possible to pick up packages for free at Wildberries pick-up points.
Marketplace users received a notice stating that buyers who need a package will have to pay for it from 6 to 15 rubles.
This amount will be debited from the card specified in the personal account.
As the company pointed out, this step will help reduce the use of plastic and will contribute to the preservation of nature.
As follows from the appendix to the offer for the provision of services for the delivery of mail to individuals, the executor, that is, the person who opened the pick-up point, must provide packages free of charge at the request of the client.
They must be designed in certain colors and have a specified image.
The packages are purchased by the owners of the PVZ, if this obligation is not fulfilled, a fine of 10,000 rubles is imposed on them for each violation.
Earlier, Wildberries customers accused the platform of debiting money from cards, the data of which had previously been deleted from their personal account.
As buyers fear, this is associated with great risks to safety.
The support service, in turn, explained that this is provided for in the user agreement.
As it follows from it, the company has the right to debit money from remote cards without notifying the client if payment from other sources does not go through for one reason or another.
The company, commenting on the situation, stated that payments to customers are made with the permission of the clients, and there can be no data leakage of bank cards.

They welcomed us warmly, explained everything clearly, scanned the documents, filled out the application, and told us how to make an appointment for the next appointment.
At the entrance, the administrator and security meet you in a cultured and respectful manner.
The building is decent, everything is set up for people - there is a hall, a toilet, and it would be nice to have a water cooler.
We came twice and everything was great!
I wish all workers peace, good luck, success and a decent salary in this difficult time for everyone!!!
Just a great place!
After a long walk on the beach, there is nothing better than sitting by the window with a glass of gin and tonic, waiting for the salad with shrimp (which is just incomparable in taste!!!)
I highly recommend this wonderful place!!!)))
A sweet cashier asked me if I wanted coffee in the café, 200 or 300 ml.
I asked for a 300 ml bottle in the store.
After a couple of minutes, I am given a plastic cup.
I wanted to be a ceramicist, so I went to the "ceramics room".
They did it to me.
I ask why in a glass, not a cup.
The girl replies that they don't have cups with a capacity of 300 ml.
How does this fit into a person's head?
Ask yourself or in the room, i.e. determine the technology for yourself: pour coffee into a cup or a disposable cup.
Get the answer - in the hall, i.e. in a cup.
Specify the volume.
To hear that 300 ml.
Put the person in front of the fact that there are no cups of this size.
Here, you see, a paper cup, 300 ml.
It is noteworthy that this is the third such case in Green Oasis that I can remember.
It is doubly noteworthy that I was not offered a standard cup so that I could pour the contents of the plastic cup into it and drink coffee the way I want. I asked for it myself.
A number of questions arise.
1. Are the Green Oasis Cafeteria and the Green Oasis organization two sides of the same coin or are they unrelated?
If unrelated, understanding appears.
If connected - why did a food and trade enterprise known in the city for its service and quality sink to the level of a stall at Kazan Station?
Rhetoric because this is the third time such a thing has happened to me.
I do not rule out that this is happening not only to me.
2. Does the cashier have instructions?
I have the impression that she acts on a whim.
I hope I'm wrong.
Please outline the actions for your employees in this case, if you are trying to get service.
We really like the circus, we've been going there since we were children.
I saw the numbers with Nikulin himself.
And now with children, nephews.
I like the atmosphere in the circus, and the programs too.
The location of the places is very convenient.
The arena is visible from almost any point, and the backs of those in front of you do not interfere.
The circus is very intimate, family-oriented!
This time we went to the New Year's program.
We were a bit disappointed.
A lot of clowns and acrobats.
I would like a room with tricks and more animals.
It's a shame that you can't take photos with animals in the foyer now.
But there must be a reason for this.
And overall, it's a very pleasant place!!
I wish you prosperity and to please us with your numbers!!!
I liked the developer, Office Construction, which chooses good places to build residential complexes.
They use high-quality materials, which fully justifies the price.
We were invited to see the complex before it was even built, so we could see everything in person, although we had looked at so many apartments and no one had offered us this.
Favorite ski resort in Russia!
The most fun is the gentle, sparse forests, especially when there is a lot of soft snow.
But the tracks are boring and short, in my opinion.
The longest on the sector e, there are even less.
But overall, it's a great atmosphere, with lots of different cafes and bars, so a fun skiing mood is guaranteed!
Great job, Peri!
I did everything as quickly and efficiently as possible, the salon was clean and pleasant.
Good service, friendly staff, there is a cloakroom and water.
Disgusting service.
The second time I come to pick up my order at the time specified in the application and wait by the window for more than 30 minutes for my order.
Today, such a service is unacceptable in business!
The response from the "care" service is that we are trying.
At the box office, even without an apology, just - we are not to blame, it's the program.
You have not found any other technical means of communication with your previously loyal customers.
Impotent men "try", and business must work.
Thank you all, we're going our separate ways.
We will not order from you again and we will not recommend you.
A spoiled mood, waiting for guests, an apology from the hostess - not the best sauce for hot rolls.
I ordered a car (Jeep Wrangler Sahara) through an organization.
The car was supposed to be delivered in 3-3.5 months (as agreed), but it took 4.5 months - the delay was caused by the situation on the border of Lithuania and Belarus (Lithuania was responsible).
I am very satisfied with the car, thanks to the guys - Dmitry, Stas, Alexander - always available, up-to-date information, professional advice and a normal human attitude.
Thank you again!
We rented a cottage for 4 days for 3 people.
The cabins are clean, cozy, warm (even very), the cabins have their own small kitchen with coffee, tea, sugar, spices, sunflower oil, all necessary dishes.
Cleaning solution and a sponge are available.
The only drawbacks are the lack of space and the tiny shower in the bathroom.
There are no places to store snowboards or skis, and there is nowhere to dry clothes, so I had to borrow a dryer from the owners and put it in place of the chair, and put a heater under it.
But overall, it's a pretty good option in a quiet place.
Stylish, clean, spacious.
The food is delicious, and the selection of dishes is sufficient for the needs of any guest.
Prices are reasonable.
There is wine and beer for those who want to drink.
I recommend the center of Moscow
A wonderful place with very polite staff, we will definitely come again.
The property has all the necessary amenities, including parking and billiards.
Rooms with good repair and all amenities.
A beautiful and aesthetic place, walked around during a visit to Kaliningrad.
I really liked it, both the miniature Russia and the Ozerov Park and the landscape.
In winter, there are many natural slides for children)
Very cool tobacco and hookah shop)
We constantly buy here, prices are low, and quality is high!
Very responsive staff, will help and answer all questions)
I highly recommend this store for a visit! ❤️
Location is convenient for everyone.
For me personally, it's normal.
They serve quickly, if none of the visitors get stuck.
It's convenient to make an appointment.
The staff is attentive, they will advise, direct, and consult even if you come on a day when they are not open.
It's basically okay.
Great guys!
Thank you very much!
Everything was done quickly and efficiently, and the prices are reasonable compared to other services.
I thought it was a button to release, and they all did it for me.
Huge thanks to the young guys!
I ordered a bouquet of 21 tulips with delivery 2 hours before March 8.
They brought the flowers in a package 6 hours later, as if they had been stolen (there is barely enough paper to wrap the flowers).
Then, when the flowers were already in the vase, I realized that something was wrong.
I compared it to the photo on the website and the color was not at all what I ordered.
I decided to count them again and it turned out that there were an even number of tulips, 20.
Support in Vatsap responded to my outrage about the color and number of flowers with "apparently they mixed up the color".
The next day I wrote again and was offered a refund of 15%.
It seems to me that this is the utmost degree of impudence and most likely falls under the definition of fraud.
I have already sent a request to the tax office about the fact that they refused to issue a receipt.
The Rospotrebnadzor and the court are next in line.
I would not recommend anyone to deal with this organization.
I have been going to Samira for more than 10 years for hair coloring and haircuts.
I want to cancel the Professionalism of the master Samira, she does her job perfectly, I am always satisfied with her work.
She always listens carefully to the client's wishes, and the client is always satisfied with the result.
I would like to recommend this master to all family and friends.
All her work is always done to the highest level!!!
Huge thanks to Master Samira 😍
I was at this gaming club and I can say that the prices are great, there are a lot of gaming computers, there are also drinks and food.
The downsides include some keyboards being broken, buttons falling off, and the computers not being able to handle the "normal gameplay" :(
Therefore, the rating is 4🥸
This place has become our family tradition)
The son goes to his group, and the mother goes to the fitbox in the evening.
The administrators are super-attentive, the coaches are professional.
They organize themed holidays for children, monitor cleanliness and equipment.
It's nice to walk and exercise.
A 6-year-old child can already withstand a strong blow, a strong OOFP.
Recommended for children, moms and dads)
Best masters!
Irina is just gold!!
She works qualitatively, is caring, and clarifies everything.
You can always talk to girls about something!
It was the third time!
I would not regret it for anything!
Finally, I can grow my hair after bleaching!
Vita also studies color theory.
Therefore, it will be able to combine blond with keratin in the near future!
And your hair will say THANK YOU🥰🥰
The reception master, Elena Polianskaya, is a very responsive master, who clearly explained everything that is included in the regular maintenance.
She also provided all kinds of assistance during the repair of my car.
And also thanks to master Valery Ushakov for his attentive and professional work.
He was ready to answer any question.
The work was done well.
The only thing that confused me when I went for the inspection was the insufficiently correct information about the work regulations, but when I went for the inspection, the regulations were more clearly explained.
I want to express my immense gratitude to the Administration staff.
A very rare certificate from the guardianship authorities was needed to approve the real estate transaction, and the staff were very helpful and helped to obtain this certificate, although they could have refused, as this is not their responsibility.
Thank you very much!
Very nice people work here.
Wonderful, kind, polite staff, I'm glad I came to this hairdresser's!👍
Master Nahida did an impeccable hair coloring, haircut, took into account and understood all my wishes, I definitely recommend it to everyone❤️
I really liked the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin.
It was restored for the 800th anniversary and is stylish and clean inside.
There are also cafes and toilets for tourists.
I went on a tour, it was great too.
And I definitely recommend the Russian collection of the Nizhny Novgorod Art Museum - an unexpectedly beautiful collection
We have been using their services for more than 3 years and are familiar with Olya.
During this time, we have seen Olya develop in her beloved profession, constantly learning new things and expanding the space for four-legged friends, which only inspires admiration and trust.
We always leave our puppies with a calm mind.
Daily video reports, if necessary, will be taken/transported by a taxi for animals.
And they will also bring something clean and tasty)
It's a fairy tale 🥰
Thank you for your care and attentive personal approach to our pets 🐕💜
The restaurant Syted Los is located near the Medvedkovo metro station.
The restaurant is very cozy!
They prepare delicious dishes.
The menu is varied.
It is advisable to book seats in advance, especially on Fridays!
A lovely well-kept zoo.
Less than Moscow, but just as interesting and convenient.
There were on weekdays - adult entrance 300₽, schoolchild 170.
There were not many people, we walked around and looked at the animals with pleasure.
The mammoth impressed me)
In Moscow, by the way, they haven't seen him.
There are a couple of cafes on the territory with reasonable prices, the toilet is clean and free, and we also saw a phone charging station.
In general, I recommend it 👍
A salon at the highest level!!!
I am very satisfied with the services of cosmetologist Kuznetsova Natalia, I only go to her.
I do various types of facial cleansing - both mechanical and with a device.
I am 100% satisfied.
Master of his craft👍
Everything is explained in detail about the peculiarities of the skin, I picked up cosmetics that are suitable for my skin type, just perfect.
I am now happy and beautiful!!!
Thank you Natalia!!!
Great club with a huge space, pool, sauna, hammam and great trainers!
The downside is the huge number of pensioners in the pool and in the changing room area.
It feels like they come to the club as if it were a public bathhouse!
Special emphasis on the women's department.
On weekdays, starting at 7:00 PM, there are a lot of people!
I give it a three, and only because of the first visit, when I went to see a consultant, if I'm not mistaken, Timur, but I could be wrong.
I quickly processed everything, explained everything +/-, everything was clear, my son also decided to apply for a card, and alas, the consultants were busy with their own affairs, the clients were waiting, a consultant finally approached my son, who knew everything, several times went to the negotiation room, discussing something funny, in the end, my son left without applying, the consultant said, well, you want it, you want it, since I was present at this meeting, I was surprised.
The new office, in a new format, is comfortable and this attitude.
It's a shame that the first impression was ruined, now we visit another branch, and there the attitude towards customers does not depend on the change of staff.
The choice is very large, the quality is good (the fabric is resistant to the appearance of lint), the staff knows their range, they help with choosing styles.
You can dress a slim girl and a child with an unusual figure and height.
It is located near the metro, and there is even a small parking lot.
We recommend it!
He was in September, celebrating his birthday.
In principle, the service and quality of the food were all good: the prices are low, the portions are medium-sized, so you can eat or order again.
The only complaint is the reservation of the table.
When I ordered, I gave the number and everything else required, after which I immediately called the bot to check the phone.
There is nothing else to do.
When I arrived at the restaurant itself, it turned out that the table had not been reserved.
We were lucky that there were free seats and we managed to get in.
But, in fact, it is a very good restaurant with an excellent price/quality ratio.
I recommend it!
I went for a cleaning in the recent weekend.
For the first time, I see such an organized staff, which has taken a very sensitive approach to many of my questions, and has suggested how and what to do for further treatment of the dental cavity.
I wholeheartedly recommend it, the only clinic where they don't want to make a profit from me to my memory.
A good shopping center.
Everything is here!
A wide range of products.
Variety of stores.
You can always find something you like.
From food to gifts.
I will never step foot in this store again.
We bought a washing machine, they said that we are outside the city, so we will take it ourselves.
The manager in the warehouse said where to drive up to the warehouse, when asked if they would "load" it, he said yes. ))
They took it out of the warehouse without a box, and when asked why, they said that's how everyone else loads it.
When I insisted, they put two strips of pencil lead in, like it will go away!
They refused to load it onto the trailer, saying it was not their job, load it yourself, they have delivery )))
When I said that I would refuse the order altogether, they said, "whatever you want, it doesn't matter to us," and in the end, one of them even went down the ramp to help his father put the car in the trailer.
I've never experienced such rude service before.
A good shopping center, very clean. A wide selection of shops and cafes with restaurants.
There is a cinema "Kosmik" and an entertainment center for children "Nevidalia".
On the lower floor is a large hypermarket "Lenta".
Convenient, large parking lot, convenient location.
A good supermarket for cosmetics, underwear and home goods.
A wide range of products, reasonable prices, polite, attentive staff.
Consultants will definitely help with the selection, advise.
Everyone will find something necessary for themselves.
A good place to spend an evening.
The staff is very good, a pleasant establishment.
I recommend that everyone never make a mistake in their choice. The best place in Krasnodar where you can relax and everything will be super.
I recommend visiting)
We express our gratitude to Marina Chasova, who was our agent for organizing the funeral.
When she came to us on a call, she took on the responsibility of all issues related to this difficult and sad event, helped us choose everything we needed, was always available and informed us about how things were going.
Thanks to her, we were able to send off a loved one with dignity.
Everything was arranged, clearly organized, as we discussed at the first meeting.
Marina, who understands perfectly well how her loved ones are feeling, gave advice on how to do things better and simply showed her human compassion towards us.
He is a very good specialist in his field.
Thank you for everything.
After reading many good reviews, I contacted RemStirMash and they assigned me to Alexander.
He began by saying that the next day he was completely free and ready to serve.
We discussed everything and set a time - 14.00.
The next day came - a call from the master in the morning and an application that he would not be able to come, a complicated application (how is this possible? and where is "completely free"?), and if he can, he will come after 18:00 instead of the appointed time of 14:00.
We agreed to meet again the next day.
15 minutes before the appointed time, another master calls and says that instead of Alexander, someone else can come, but in 2 hours.
What kind of tricks are these?
Two days of empty waiting, all planned tasks put aside!
In short, a competent master Ivan came, fixed the breakdown, for which he is thanked.
So don't be fooled by empty promises and don't waste your time.
The evening observations did not live up to expectations at all.
First there was a short lecture with incomprehensible material, then we looked through the telescope.
Everything was not very organized, children kept trying to watch several times, adults crowded and could not let others watch.
The objects we looked at in the telescope were the size of an ordinary star, and you can see them for free without a telescope.
The girl answered the questions in a not very accessible way, not realizing that ordinary people do not know many nuances.
It is not clear why 600 rubles.
An amazing place, one of the oldest Mexican restaurants in the city, it has been around since the early 2000s.
A cozy atmosphere, always friendly service.
The price is average.
Sit down, eat 2-3 dishes for two (the portions are very large) + a cocktail, about 2500 rubles👌
There are interesting beer cocktails, based on beer and tequila, for example, Macho Boracho, which I highly recommend trying.
Price 420 rubles for 0.5 l.
And in general, the food in the restaurant itself is very tasty, I don't know how others feel, but I really liked it, I will definitely recommend it to my friends)
Great store, I have been buying products from them for a long time, since the very beginning.
Good quality products.
I bought a mixer five years ago, and it still works perfectly and is in good condition.
That's why when we did a major renovation in the apartment, we took everything we needed right here.
Excellent service!!!
It is located very conveniently, there is both the city center and the countryside, in general, it is convenient)!
The quality of the gas is good, I fill up twice a week for more than 2 years, there are no problems, the price is great!!!
The cubs do not deceive by the card and cash, by the liter they do not deceive.
The store, I liked it!
You can choose any model, at a democratic price, and for any purpose!
The staff is always ready to help with your selection.
I bought a laptop for my daughter, for school, because her laptop broke down.
Helped, found, gave a guarantee (month) Thank you! 👍
The sommelier is working.
He helped with the wine selection, because it's hard to figure out the menu on your own.
The experience of working with a sommelier is interesting, charming Vasily, there are not enough of them in Moscow.
I ate the pike - magically, chef, respect.
The children's menu is the same as everywhere: macaroni, fries, chicken nuggets. I ate pizza, it's HOT here!
Adults enjoyed the truffle, while children enjoyed the sausage and mushrooms.
My husband ate smoked ribs - they were a bomb, soft, juicy, and aromatic.
The staff is good, all smiling and friendly.
We liked it.
A brand new WB order pickup point is located in a convenient location.
Working hours are from 10.00 to 21.00, without weekends and holidays.
Inside the PVZ there are changing rooms.
A very good place.
Real professionals work here, who are always ready to help.
There is also a group and chat on Vkontakte for informative communication.
Fast issuance.
It is nice that the goods can be immediately viewed and tried on.
It's great that it's near the house.
Excellent, modern hotel.
The room is spacious, very clean and comfortable.
Everything stated in the description is available.
Breakfast is included in the price, with a wide selection of dishes to suit every taste.
Convenient access, your own parking lot near the entrance.
Hard 5.
A wonderful puppet theater.
We often go to different performances.
Today we went to the play "The Princess and the Frog".
At the moment, this is the best of the children's performances.
It was very interesting, lots of dolls, special effects.
Even the 14-year-old son went along just for the company, but said it was a very good performance.
We vacationed with my husband for 10 days in January 2023.
The holiday was a success on "5", everything was great!
I will start in order:
On the day of arrival, they called to confirm the time of our arrival, gave us information about the cost of the transfer (1400 from the airport), we ordered a taxi (at 23:00 the price was 850r), we arrived quickly, there were no traffic jams, they let us through the gate without any problems.
The administrative building is next door, and they processed it quickly, in about 15-20 minutes.
All buildings have an elevator, which is a big plus!
The 2-bedroom room is spacious, with warm floors in the room and bathroom (without heating), a huge balcony with rattan furniture (table and two chairs), panoramic windows (in building 5).
The furniture in the room is normal, there is a ladies' table with a large mirror, the fridge is not very small, and there is even a freezer.
There are a lot of green plants in Building 5.
Everything is clean, they change towels and linens as you wish, but if you do not ask for a change, they still change them on the fourth day, and the linens are of good quality.
The territory is well-maintained, there are benches everywhere, the paths are clean, and there is beautiful lighting at night.
A minibus runs to the beach and back every 30 minutes.
5 minutes to the nearest public transport stop.
In the dining hall, the friendly guys always wish you a good day.
The food is decent, but everyone has their own preferences, we were all satisfied, and the choice and quality were always good, whether it was fish, chicken, or chips, or whatever, vegetables for side dishes every day, homemade baked goods tasty, more than four drinks, coffee beans, they always make pancakes for breakfast, but the cheese and sausage are not very good.
The medical staff is very friendly and loyal.
We were also lucky with the weather, there was no rain, the temperature was 11-16°C, and the sun was shining.
Everything was great, we really had a good time.
I would like to come again, and in January, when there are fewer vacationers).
It's a shame that the pool and the fitness center will not be put into operation.
Thank you to the entire team of the sanatorium for their coordinated and high-quality work!
We have been going to "Poleot" since August.
My daughter turned 4 in September.
Everything is exactly what she likes, the coach praises her) that's the most important thing.
Let's go to Valeria Nikolaevna Pleshkova!)
I never would have thought that my daughter is so flexible!
Traveling through the streets of St. Petersburg, my friends and I decided to check out this promising establishment - and we were not disappointed!
The prices are very affordable, and the incredibly delicious pizza is gone in a flash, not even the crusts remain.
Nice atmosphere and charming staff, in short, I recommend it :)
It so happened that I ended up in the Tomarovsky hospital with high blood pressure and a rapid heartbeat.
I was extremely surprised: the cleanliness, order, wet cleaning twice, moreover, the windowsills, furniture, and doors are wiped down.
The food is baby food, but it's great!!!
I was surprised that at 7 a.m. they bring tea with a sandwich (bread, butter, cheese), so to speak, a pre-breakfast.
The medical staff is sensitive, everyone is putting injections intramuscularly and intravenously!!!
While the drip is running, they will come in, ask about your well-being...
I have had a heart ultrasound before, but this is the first time (unfortunately, I do not know the name of the doctor, a young man).
Special thanks to the treating doctor Vetokhina Klavdia Fedorovna!
A true professional: attentive, knowledgeable, provides a comprehensive answer to any question; she selected the dosage and medications that normalized both blood pressure and heart rate, which I was unable to achieve after consulting with other doctors.
A huge thank you to the head doctor, Mevshi Olga Vladimirovna, who organized the smooth running of the hospital!!!
Thank you to the medical staff, the nurses, and the cleaners!
The impression left by visiting the customer service was good.
In the hall, I met the administrator.
Competent and polite specialists quickly and patiently help clients with all their questions.
The specialist assisted me in filing the application and provided clarification on my question.
For a small store, it's a very good selection of products.
There are semi-finished products, milk, vegetables, household chemicals, and various small items.
It is open 24 hours a day, which is very convenient, and the staff is always friendly
It's cool when there is a place in the city where you can go skiing.
The elevators are busy on weekends, of course, with a 40-second ascent and a 5-10 minute wait.
But overall, it's great, immersion in the atmosphere of positivity and winter, even if there is mud and dampness on the roads.
I contacted the service for repairing the iPhone 11 Pro.
The rear window was smashed and the battery needed to be replaced.
I contacted the master directly, Alexander, who explained all the details of the repair and immediately set the price range.
Thank you for the repair, everything was done well.
The masters are very pleasant to talk to, they will show everything and tell everything.
However, when replacing parts, the camera was hit, the focus was off.
I immediately reported the problem and received a quick response.
The error was corrected as soon as possible, everything is working fine.
There are good specialists in this service, with whom it is pleasant to have a dialogue.
Prices, compared to other services, are acceptable, affordable.
If repairs are needed again, I will definitely contact you!
Large-scale, beautiful, atmospheric.
But, like most historical objects, it is in a state that requires close, prompt and high-quality attention from restorers.
Therefore, 4 and most of these stars are given to creators, not to keepers
Great apartment
Responsive concierges, garbage is collected, the area is clean and beautiful, close to bus stops, schools and shops.
20 minutes to the metro by public transport
We have opened a good, cozy place for recreation in our area.
There are all the necessary shops.
A food court that is both impressive and diverse in terms of food.
The tables are located in comfortable areas.
There is no monotony.
Well, we went, we tried...
The interior has nothing in common with a cozy Italian cafe...
The space is very limited, the tables are rectangular, like in a dining room.
Pizza... well, who hasn't tried something tastier, so it seemed to me that it was somehow faceless.
I didn't like the fact that the waiter was always standing behind you and almost always looked at your companion in the face.
We were uncomfortable.
Connolly, yes, they are delicious.
We will not come here again and I will not recommend it to my friends.
Lena Grosskopf is the best hairdresser I have ever been to.
She does everything very carefully and well, I go to her with pleasure, I understand that everything will be done perfectly.
I only take my daughter to Lena too.
The atmosphere in the salon is amazing.
Thank you so much!
We broke down on the way from Nizhny, and the good people from KatrResurs quickly responded and helped!
Respect to you and prosperity, there should be more such good people!
And the server is clean and good there!
We went to see Sergei Chigarkov's concert.
Excellent concert venue, great sound and atmosphere.
We will definitely come to the planned concerts this year.
A peaceful place, a wonderful Georgian restaurant, on weekends and holidays live music is played!
The staff is pleasant and responsive!
There is a children's room.
Delicious Georgian cuisine!
The rating is the highest, I adore this place ❤
The park is in the center of the city, very easy to get to.
The park is clean, there is space for both children and adults.
But there has been no sand in the children's playground for a long time, and there is still dust.
There is also a fenced football field, which, unfortunately, is not very well-maintained.
But there are more advantages in our park.
Spacious hall, clean, clear arrangement of goods.
There are products that can only be bought at the Crossroads.
The staff is friendly.
I didn't get any bad products.
Often there are promotions and discounts.
It's nice that it's close to home.
You can always find a parking space.
I have been to the bar twice, everything was great, polite staff, tasty food and most importantly, great music, the DJs know their stuff.
The only thing is, the second time the lead singer of the group "Ruki Vverh Band" disappoints.
Not only does he sing softly, but he also reads the lyrics of most songs from his phone, which was particularly striking when it was the songs of the group "Ruki Vverh".
It's somehow illogical (performing in the bar Raised Hands, in the group Raised Hands Band).
We were on vacation in early March.
A good hotel, pleasant rooms.
On his birthday, they gave him a room with a view of the Kremlin.
Room cleaning every day.
Refilling water, tea, coffee, shampoo and changing towels.
Breakfast is just a waste of time.
There is a mini bar with crazy prices.
If you want to order room service from the restaurant, add 20% to the bill.
The prices in the restaurant are slightly overpriced.
Tastes like three plus.
The water park was included in the cost of accommodation.
The water park itself cannot be called the best in Russia.
But the masseur was just amazing.
Everything is fine, but the departure was a bit disappointing: no goodbye, no good road.
The employee at the entrance didn't even help open the door, seeing women with a bunch of bags and suitcases.
This needs to be worked on to maintain the brand.
A great place to get together with friends and have a soak.
A large and comfortable sauna, billiards, an outdoor pool, and karaoke.
The food is delicious, the drinks are fresh)
The workshop is at a high level!
In a short time, he has already repaired 3 pairs of shoes (2 men and 1 women).
Everything is fine.
Quality work at height.
Special thanks to the master for his careful attitude and quality work!
Great basketball school!
My son is 5 months old and he loves it, he looks forward to every training session.
Individual approach to children, interesting activities, warm and friendly atmosphere.
The store is great, the staff will go, I order online myself.
Excellent location of the store.
Plus, there are always discounts and promotions, which is also good
A good AV store - convenient location, large hall, good assortment.
Special thanks to the staff for their responsiveness!
There are cafeterias with several tables.
I often go there - everything is fine!
Nice pool!
I am specifically talking about the "frog", our coach Anastasia Vitalyevna is very liked by the child and is professional!!
The locker rooms are clean, the water is warm, and there are hairdryers!
I love the bakery's croissants, service, croissants, breakfasts and coffee are always top notch.
But alas, not this time, I ordered coffee and a couple of croissants, the girls at the cash register didn't make the coffee until I reminded them, they made it, it's impossible to drink, it smells bad and there's a taste of spoiled milk, I decided not to finish it and just left.
Last time there was a long black hair in my coffee, they replaced it.
Please be more careful, I am a guest returning here, even after such incidents.
Gorgeous eyebrows are here!
Victoria adjusts perfectly, taking into account all the proportions of the face individually.
Correction with warm wax, which effectively removes all the fluff, and the eyebrows look neat for a long time.
The color is chosen based on the type of hair and skin, which is why the paint lasts a long time.
Better not to have eyebrows!
Thank you so much for organizing my mom's move!
Moving is always a huge stress, but with your company everything went very clearly, quickly, and efficiently.
Special thanks to Vadim and Roman!
I will recommend your company to all my friends!
Everything is at the highest level.
We have been going to Novodent for dental treatment for the whole family for a long time.
Recently, I had my 8-year-old son's teeth treated, everything went perfectly, the child is calm and ready to come again.
There is no need to wait long, there are no queues because the appointment is by appointment.
In my opinion, the most delicious shawarma in Tambov is only here, I am not a fan of shawarma, BUT when I want something unhealthy, only here and only here.
Tasty, fresh meat with a lot of fillings.
And I just don't understand why, but it never flows out of me.
Often when you finish a shawarma, you can't eat it anymore because there's a lot of sauce and water, and it's just too much... but not here.
So, guys, you are the best🙂
Good teacher staff.
The food in the dining hall is always fresh.
Interesting lessons in the school museum, various events are held throughout the school year
Nice store, polite staff, good selection.
However, the big downside is that the goods that are brought in seem to be destroyed right in the store.
Sometimes there is little space to pass between the rows, and it is also not very pleasant when the goods are just lying on the floor, without crates, but this is more of a comment on the organization, rather than on a particular store
A delightful example of Soviet architecture.
Strict grandeur, which is carefully tended to.
I had a double pleasure from the concert, largely due to the atmosphere of the cultural center.
While we waited in the lobby, I clearly felt that I had come to the Event, that this was really a coming out into the light.
I was looking for a set of clutch plates for my MB Sprinter.
I stumbled upon this online auto parts store completely by accident.
I called, gave my code, they said wait)
After 10 minutes, they called back and offered several options.
Since the car is a personal workhorse, he didn't want to skimp and asked for a good set of LUK clutches to be ordered.
Another 5 minutes later, they called back and said that there was good news for you.
If you take not the entire basket + disc + scraper, but the LUK basket + disc set and the LUK scraper separately, it will be cheaper by 2 thousand rubles, which could not be pleasing.
I took the clutch to the service.
When removing the gearbox, it was discovered that a flywheel was also needed, and the faster it was, the better.
I already knew where to go), the manager understood the situation and ordered without pre-payment on the phone (the first time I paid the same way when I received it).
The following day, the crankshaft was in hand.
The car is happy with the new crankshaft and clutch, I'm happy that everything came quickly, that they went out of their way.
I will definitely recommend and use vinkod.shop
The New Year's party was a great success, but with nuances.
I booked a two-seater table, but they put me at a four-seater.
But no problem.
It's just strange that they didn't warn us.
The kitchen is a four, the fish didn't work out at all.
The host with competitions made at the school level, to be honest, is not very good.
BUT everything is perfect about the music.
The atmosphere was at its best.
Everything else seems like nitpicking.
Thank you for the event
I am leaving my review, with words of gratitude to all the staff of the maternity hospital number 7 in Chelyabinsk.
Only people who know and love their work work at this institution, doctors and nurses are from heaven.
Both in the obstetrics department, in the maternity ward, and in the postpartum ward.
But I want to express special thanks to Kotlyarova E.Y., the head of the maternity ward on the 5th floor, and Yarantseva N.V., the obstetrician in the maternity ward, thank you so much for your help in the birth of my daughter, for your kind heart, for your great professionalism.
Wonderful store.
A wide range of balls, always fast order processing and delivery.
Professional staff.
Very beautiful bouquets, always left with great taste, always fresh flowers.
Visited the establishment on the recommendation.
The food is amazing, the programs are nonexistent, the waiters are a bit cheeky, but we were in a great mood with the kids and celebrating an important event, so we were friendly.
There was no fire service, the children waited.
You can safely go for good food.
