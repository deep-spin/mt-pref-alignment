The July issue is traditionally published during the Moscow Film Festival, and this, of course, is very sad: to read the pages when the soul yearns for Shabrova.
However, we will talk about the MMKF next time (for now, I will just complain that this year, the organizers' inexplicable idea has finally taken root in their minds that the happy owners of purchased tickets are infinitely more important for the festival than accredited guests, a ridiculous and quite offensive principle that no normal film festival in the world is guilty of), and in this issue, we will report on what we saw in Cannes and at the Kinotavr.
The cover of the July issue is adorned with another pleasant face - the main character of the film "Predators", produced by Robert Rodriguez, and inside the magazine you should try to read the article about "The Beginning" by Christopher Nolan (a man, by the way, who rebooted "Batman..."), the most anticipated film of the summer.
We are also publishing the first part of a fairly detailed guide to the work of Alfred Hitchcock this time, and here it is definitely not necessary to advertise anything specifically, and it is clear to me that the author of "Suspicion" and "The Rope" is our Tatyana Aleshicheva, Boris Glaizerov, Anna Golovnaya, Nick de Semlin, Dan Jolling, Tamara Dondurey, Nikolai Karayev, Denis Korsakov, Maria Kuvshennova, Ivan Kulikov, Will Lawrence, Sergei Mезенов, Sergei Natapov, Ian Nathan, Kim Newman, Zaira Ozova, Nev Pierce, Alexey Prostyanov, Seraphima Skibyuk, Adam Smith, Mura Soboleva, Vasily Stepanov, Alexander Strelkov, Ollie Richards, Oleg Tyshchenkov, Alena Logunova, Chris Hewitt, Olga Shakina, the London-based journalist Evelyn Salt, despite her brilliant record, were suspected of spying for the Russians and decided to catch her at all costs.
Trapped in a corner, she will dye her hair black, as we are used to seeing, and will go out to find the truth herself.
Another action movie starring Angelina Jolie as a seductive bad girl promises to further cement the actress's position in the action genre.
She will cause one accident after another, run along walls like in "The Matrix" and knock strong men around like children, all while wearing the same strict suits.
That's how beauty should save the world.
Here he is, the native one, who exploded and repaired the world with the "Fifth Element" and made Milla Jovovich the most beautiful woman in the universe.
Bruce Willis was the most superheroic guy, and Gary Oldman was the most stylish and flawless embodiment of Evil.
And yet, all together, it turned out to be not a tedious blockbuster of the American type about saving humanity, but a lovely living carnival.
What Beson did for 13 years between Element... and Adela... is not something I want to remember.
He was not idle, to put it mildly, but all this scriptwriting and production fuss and rare, forced directorial performances will be forgotten.
But “Adele...” is hardly likely.
When you watch this movie, it seems that the 13-year-old before us was not our Besson, but some kind of doppelganger.
And he himself, the real one, lived in a small apartment in Montmartre, drank wine in the cafe across the street, and wrote a story about a charming adventurer.
Retelling the plot (even in broad strokes) to build up expectations is more sinful than usual in this case.
The incredible drive here is that every turn or remark is followed by surprises.
And they are all pleasant.
Either a girl or a vision
UNUSUAL ACCESSORIES FOR ADEL
The most exciting adventure film of the decade suggests that "The Extraordinary Adventures of Adèle" will start like "Amélie", head towards "Jurassic Park", continue with "Indiana Jones" and "Mummy", and end with "Titanic".
The film is based on the first volume of Jacques Tardi's comics about journalist Adèle Blanc-Sec.
Louise Bourgoin has appeared in only three films before Adèle.
The actress became famous for her role in "The Girl from Monaco", for which she was nominated for a Cesar Award.
The director does not run after the audience with outstretched arms, begging them to appreciate the special effects, sets, or stunts, but rather entices them, like an old-fashioned novelist exclaiming before a great journey to the center of the earth or to the ends of the world: “Come with me, my reader, great things await us!”
At the same time, Besson approaches genre cinema, about which he knows absolutely everything, unceremoniously and cheerfully, like a boy who has watched old films and read Jules Verne.
Manipulating banalities, not denying oneself cynicism and not being afraid to take risks
Director: Luc Besson
IN THE ROLES: Louise Bourguignon, Mathieu Amalric, Frédéric Beigbeder, Gilles Lellouche
SCENE: Strange things were happening in Paris in 1912.
The city was overwhelmed by an ancient monster that an old medium had brought to life.
The police are chasing after the fossilized creature, as well as a famous hunter, a couple of scientists from the natural history museum, and journalist Adèle Blanc-Sec, who has a case not so much with the beast itself, but with the medium - she needs to save her sister.
For the same purpose, the girl is dragging a real mummy from Egypt.
RELEASES ON JULY 22
"Adele..." is one of those cases where a parody becomes the pinnacle of the genre and is capable of radically changing it, directing it down a new path.
This was the case with Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, with Quentin Tarantino's gangster films, with the aforementioned "Indiana Jones" (they paid tribute to it and made fun of it), and finally, with the same "Fifth Element".
Besson's style in this film is made up of verbal trickery, actorly clowning, and plotting acrobatics (circus terms are entirely appropriate - the union of the two arts here is as organic and strong as ever).
A few words should also be said about Adele herself.
It embodied the undeservedly forgotten type of adventuress, who is driven not so much by the exploitation of sexuality as by pure courage and daring.
In movies, such girls are usually paired with some kind of bumbling macho or lovesick romantic.
TEXT: ALEXANDER STRELKOV
Face to face with history
There is only a timid and comical admirer, who only flits about underfoot (his knowledge of zoology is the only useful thing about him).
Therefore, the energetic girl does not waste time on trivial matters of love, but spends time having fun in the company of ancient corpses, which, by the way, play a key role in the plot.
After being trained in numerous genre "cats" and seemingly completely jaded, Luc Besson showed unexpected creative cunning, reminding us that the line between the preferences of bored mall visitors and discerning art house patrons is easily crossed by films for cheerful weirdos.
Playing adventure cinema without sadness, fear, or reproach
The Room of Death
A hermetic horror with pretensions to psychology and a political context, Jonathan Liebesman's debut horror film in 2002 was panned by critics, but was well received by the public and did well at the box office, and most importantly, it caught the eye of producer Michael Bay.
This is how the young director ended up at a factory that churns out new horrors according to old formulas: Bay set himself the goal of re-filming the entire horror classics as remakes and entrusted LeBesman with the prequel to "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (2006).
The critics grumbled again, but the public liked it again - Leibesman worked in the spirit of the "new horrors", emphasizing the excessive physiological nature of violence.
In fact, his example shows how an entire genre is convulsing, trying to come up with new ways to affect a saturated audience: the naturalistic gore of splatter films merges with the chase scenes of slashers.
The plot is reminiscent of the "Saw" franchise, but without gallons of blood.
Among the prototypes is Vincente Natali's debut film, "Cube". The film was not made by Michael Bay.
So in "The Death Room", Libesman had to take a different path: instead of a senseless massacre or a monotonous chase from a maniac, he preferred a more intelligent option - almost without the notorious bloodshed, but with psychological games and puzzles.
The evil doctors here play cat and mouse with their test subjects.
Meanwhile, three men in a locked room are trying to come up with a survival strategy: team up or shoot each other?
Play by the rules and obey orders from outside?
Or try to break out of your cage at any cost?
They are not the only ones being tested, but also a young, ambitious employee of the special services, who is being tested for ruthlessness by an experienced professor who is well-versed in wild experiments.
SCENE: For $250, four volunteers sign up for an easy test.
They are put in an isolated room and each is given a stack of sheets with meaningless questions.
Then a polite man in a white coat enters the room, introduces himself as a doctor, and shoots one of the subjects in the head.
The game of survival begins, which government agents are closely watching through the window.
Too contemplative for a horror film, but not enough for an outright art house film
He can conduct a secular conversation and go on a ride with a fire extinguisher, but he cannot pass up a single skirt.
Charming Nastya, on the contrary, is discerning and unyielding in her sympathies.
She is offended by her father's courtly lifestyle and openly watches as he dives into the pool for another romantic victim, as if parodying the famous scene from Paul Verhoeven's Showgirls.
The daughter rebels, and the father tempts her young suitor from a poor family with money.
But the main topic of the family conflict is not the generation gap or the choice of profession, which has already been predetermined one way or another, but the unsuccessful attempts by the girl to refute the obvious idea that in modern Moscow everything can be bought and sold.
Mher Mkrtchan, along with Pavel Bardyn, directed a comedy with Ivan Urgant called "Three and a Snowflake".
Depardieu convincingly portrayed the father of a growing daughter in the genre of comedy
The fragmented plot revolves around the love affairs of the characters, who are constantly talking about psychology, but seem to be emphasizing the language of gaze and gesture, thanks to the clever directorial decision.
The secondary plot branches (a girl who was injured in a car accident and whom Alexei wants to marry, an alcoholic athlete played by Sergei Gorobchenko) are, alas, only sketched in.
It is especially regrettable that the line about the business of buying up football players was left out.
SCENE: The agent who sells football stars is most concerned about the fate of his underage daughter, Nastya.
The kind-hearted dad changes his girlfriends like expensive shirts, but his daughter is about to turn eighteen and she must definitely marry a guy with "backbone".
How disappointing it is for a businessman when Nastya, in her struggle for independence and in defiance of her father, chooses her peer and business partner.
However, with a potential tagline for the film's audience, the author hit the mark: "Don't look for a problem where there is none." More precisely, you couldn't say it better.
Their resemblance is simply astounding.
In both films, there are squads of tough guys, lucky soldiers, who are forced to take revenge on those who betrayed them, and there is always one beautiful girl in each company.
The heroes race through practically the same parts of the world (both films begin in Latin America and end in the port of Los Angeles) and use the same spectacular shots - in both films, something stuffed with dollar bills explodes and a whirlwind of bills descends on the set.
Even the villains, dressed in expensive costumes, are not easy to distinguish from each other (they are played by the same actor in both cases - Jason Patrick here, Patrick Wilson there).
Zoe Saldana's previous role was as Neytiri in Avatar.
Sylvain White used to make dance battles films - "Dance Brotherhood".
Chris Evans was recently asked to play the hero of other comics: he will be Captain America.
Director Sylvain White was inspired by a series of comics that came out in the 1970s and was rebooted in the 2000s, and Joe Carnahan was inspired by a comedy series from the 1980s.
It's just amazing how, without coordinating, they brought different material to an absolutely identical thundering motif, making fairly heavy, predictable, unnecessary action movies that evoke a lot of images with Willis and Schwarzenegger (comparisons invariably favor Bruce and Arnold).
If you have to choose between these two films, then Lozers looks slightly more appealing and is clearly more efficient in terms of efficiency (after all, the budget is three and a half times smaller).
At least there's Zoe Saldana, who looks great in a bikini.
IN THE ROLES: Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Zoey Saldana, Chris Evans, Patrick Wilson, Idris Elba, Columbus Short
SCENARIO: During an operation in the Bolivian jungle, a group of experienced commandos working for the CIA was betrayed by their own superiors: the helicopter carrying the children they were trying to save was blown up, and the soldiers themselves were considered dead from that moment on.
But they are alive - and intend to take revenge on the scoundrel with the deep voice who orchestrated it all.
All of this is cute, but, to be honest, it's only worth spending an hour and a half of your life on a White painting if you have absolutely no other options.
A condiment made from recycled materials, conditionally edible boletus
A simple story about a Romanian convict on the run
A Romanian low-budget film that won an award at a prestigious international film festival.
In principle, with only these data in hand, one can vividly imagine the hypothetical content of the painting and even some specific details of its form.
Without a shadow of a doubt, the film promises to be sharply social.
Of course, it will be realistic, and tough.
There is a high probability of participation of non-professional actors.
There will also be a lot of Romanian poverty in the film (yes, poverty knows no nationality, but Romanian poverty, as our festival laureates prove from film to film, is particularly poor).
Also, without knowing the year of release, you could easily assume that what is happening on the screen is the work of some underground critical realists from the countries of the Warsaw Pact, who were given a lecture on Bresson in the early 1980s.
The film received the Grand Prix of the Jury at the Berlin Film Festival.
The script is based on a play by Andrea Valian, whose work is in particularly high demand among directors of the Romanian “new wave”.
Operator Marius Panduru often works with Corneliu Porumbay.
Everything said is true for Florin Serban's debut work, and - understand us correctly - is not at all pejorative, but rather recommendatory: the Romanian "new wave" is in that blessed stage of development when its representatives believe in the methods...
His work has not yet been shaken.
And this moment must be caught: it is only thanks to this faith that one can endure the one and a half hour spectacle of the Romanian colony for minors and surrender to the charisma of the talented Pistoreanu (whose story, despite the chasm dividing two cultures, can easily be shared).
convert it into an exploitation film à la the 1970s, with a cowboy who decides to walk out of prison, where he will soon be released, to the nearest saloon).
IN ROLES: Georg Pistereanu, Adina Condescu, Mihai Constantin, Clara Voda, Marian Bratu
SYNOPSIS: After serving his four years, 18-year-old convict Silvio (Pistoreanu) is soon due to be released, but suddenly discovers that his mother wants to take his younger brother with her to Italy.
From this point on, the young man's behavior becomes inappropriate.
An affair with social worker Anna further pushes the guy to desperate acts, the meaning of which is exhausted by the title of the film.
What a load of rubbish!
If you want to watch, watch.
A decent debut, which gives faint hope that a decent direction will emerge from Romanian arthouse someday
A cartoon about the joys of villainy and family life
The directorial debut of a man named Grob (Sop) and his co-author Reno was made under the auspices of producer Christopher Meledandri, the gray cardinal of American animation, responsible, in particular, for all the "Ice Ages", "Horton" and "Robots".
"Ugly Me" is probably the best work of his team: the picture is beautifully drawn (by the way, it makes sense to watch it in 3D), especially if you like it when different objects keep jumping out of the screen and into the hall), it is well written, and, most importantly, there is not a single low-brow joke here, which on "Ice Age" made you have to shamefully squeeze into your seat and cover your child's eyes with your hands.
It is clear that the reason for the change in course was not the authors' sense of measure, but the glaring asexuality of the main character, which in turn was dictated by the unwillingness to touch on the topic of pedophilia in any way.
For the "adult" part here, in addition to the main conflict of single fatherhood, there is quite harsh black humor (which, one would like to think, we owe to director Coffin).
Overall, it's a very likable movie - so much so that at some point it even becomes too perfect and right.
It is clear that a lot of hard work has gone into the work of a cohesive team of marketers, who have thought about every detail so that the film would appeal to all categories of citizens.
Not that we wanted to see the cannibals eat the heroes of the children's cartoon or the atomic explosion destroy them
SCENE: The snouty villain Gru, whose childhood dreams of space exploration have evolved over the years into the idea of stealing the Moon, in order to carry out his grand plan and eliminate a young competitor, is forced to enlist the help of children.
In some advanced orphanage, he adopts three female orphans - Margo in glasses, Edith in a cap, and Agnes, who is as cute as a kitten from Shrek.
As is usually the case, children immediately transform the plans of adults.
The main character is based on Christopher Melendy - they both have bald heads, big noses, and a sense of humor.
In the original, the main characters were voiced by Steve Carell and Jason Segel.
In the final, Grue dances Travolta's part
A van pulls up to an abandoned trailer somewhere in the middle of a hypothetical desert, and three pairs of the finest babes get out.
That's right.
The carriers of this gift themselves are not so significant.
The camera confidently draws attention to this part of the body.
For those who appreciate it, we have some good news right away - the entire film is in the same vein.
Rick Jacobson understands the most important things about women's beauty and conducted the casting in a way that what happens on screen is secondary.
And a lot of fun things happen.
The "broker", "killer" and "stripper" dig in the sand, get drenched (don't ask why), carry some kind of purge and periodically fight viciously.
The creators believe that a pregnant sow with generous curves, covered in mud, with a broken nose and shining white teeth is cool.
"Stervoznye shutki" are primarily focused on classic sexploitation films.
Rick Jacobson filmed episodes of "Zena - Queen of Warriors" and "The Amazing Adventures of Hercules".
A film with a similar spirit in the Moscow box office is “The Pole for Jennifer”.
It's also cool when a bitchy beauty whips eggs at a gangster, a mohawked punk fights alongside a Japanese schoolgirl, a samurai sword is involved, and lesbian sex is had; and the plot is driven forward through an endless number of flashbacks.
In general, for a film fetishist, there is a real Klondike of pleasures here.
It's clear, of course, that Jacobson and his gang were having a blast making this trash parody, but the task itself seems rather strange.
If it weren't for the physical attributes of the actresses, it would have been boring by the middle.
It can be assumed that this game came to us from the adult night channel (by the way, Jacobson often takes on serial episodes)
IN ROLES: Julia Voth, Erin Cummings, America Olivo, Michael Hirst, Ron Melendez
SCENE: Three dangerous beauties bring a mafia boss to the desert, who has diamonds worth a substantial sum hidden somewhere here.
Having achieved nothing and shot the unfortunate bandit, the women start to bicker, fight with each other and the occasional scoundrels who arrive from somewhere, as well as regularly kiss and hug.
As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that none of the three are who they appeared to be at the beginning.
Apparently, according to the author, it's even more fun that way.
A product for a small circle of fans of monstrous bad taste
Yes, with his latest film, Judgment Day, the disillusioned Mad Max for the poor, Marshall has made a serious misstep.
The bloodthirsty and biting peplum returns the director's shaken confidence.
The new politically incorrect and grim magnum opus is not ashamed of its modest budget, obvious sources of inspiration, and fierce B-movie aesthetics.
The film also features the hooligan bravado of "Dog Warriors" and the savage brutality of "The Descent".
The "Marshall Plan" to clean up the "peplum" from the post-gladiatorial film trash that had accumulated worked, overall.
In 2011, Kevin McDonald will present his interpretation of the history of the Ninth Legion.
His battle-scarred legionaries (among others, the unexpectedly colorful David Morrissey and Liam Cunningham) are tough guys trying to reconcile their military duty with an overwhelming desire to survive.
Murder and the intimate details of relieving natural needs in ancient times are depicted here with love and detail.
The scene of the destruction of the Ninth Legion, which cost a lot of budget money, is directly inspired by the opening sequence in the German forests from the now classic "Gladiator" by Sir Ridley Scott, but for some reason, one doesn't want to accuse Marshall of plagiarism: he works honestly and without complaints.
IN THE ROLES: Michael Fassbender, Olga Kurilenko, Dominic West, Liam Cunningham, David Morrissey
SCENE: The lands of modern Scotland, occupied by the Holy Roman Empire.
A remote outpost, where centurion Quintus Diaz (Fassbender) is on duty, is ruthlessly overrun by a Pictish reconnaissance team.
The miraculously saved Diaz is forced to first join the infamous Ninth Legion, and then, with a group of other surviving Romans, try to escape from a group of Pictish fighters led by the sadist Itaine (Kurilenko).
So far, the subtle art house actor has only managed to win bit parts in Hollywood, but it is very much to be hoped that things will change after Centurion.
Pepulum - an edition corrected and supplemented.
Almost like "Gladiator", only more modest and harsh
The story continues about schoolgirl Bella (Kristen Stewart) and her complicated relationship with two highly promising young men - the pale-faced vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and the werewolf-cultivator Jacob (Taylor Lautner).
Pattinson's fans held their breath.
A large-scale film version of the cartoon series about a bald boy wizard who is called upon to bring peace to four kingdoms.
The fire god waged a bloody war and subjugated his neighbors.
Young Aang can stop him only if he learns to control all the elements and becomes the Avatar.
The Cobb house (Leonardo DiCaprio) is able to steal other people's thoughts and works tirelessly in the field of industrial espionage.
As it penetrates the object's sleep, it forces the sleeping brain to work according to its own rules.
But this time he will have to do the opposite - leave something in one head that wasn't there before.
A scenic lesson in managing illusory worlds by Christopher Nolan.
An experienced wizard (Nicholas Cage) finds a young assistant in the hope of defeating the evil magician (Alfred Molina) together.
With the help of destructive spells, they will set up a dragon-filled hell in the middle of Manhattan, complete with explosions.
As bald as a billiard ball, Kisa has set her sights on taking over the world, and now the super-agent dogs are forced to team up with their meowing antagonists.
The second series of the fluffy family comedy.
A group of hardened thugs led by the seemingly fragile Royce (Adrien Brody) mysteriously find themselves on another planet, where they are hunted by stylish fanged aliens.
The return of the cult character of the 80s to the big screen.
Pay attention to George Clooney, who teamed up with rock photographer-turned-director Anton Corbijn ("Control") for a very curious existential exploration of the psychology of an aging hitman hiding from people in a small Italian town and belatedly coming to understand human nature.
"The visionary artist of Corbijn's scale and the magnificent George Clooney are a cinematic union made in heaven," boasts the studio press release.
In addition, this project is another confirmation of Clooney's longest love affair in life - with Italy: filming took place in the picturesque town of Castel del Monte in Abruzzo.
Taking Martin Booth's novel "A Very Hidden Gentleman" as a basis, Rowan Joffe made some changes to his script: the English narrator was replaced by an American in the title, and the main character went from being an illegal arms dealer to just a murderer.
Otherwise, the story is close to the original: while hitman Jack tries to deal with his last job and finally give up his lucrative profession, his icy heart melts under the charm of a local priest (Paolo Bonacelli) and a street prostitute (Tekla Ruten), whom the character played by Clooney instantly falls in love with.
"Jack tempts fate," says the official synopsis.
A dangerous messenger of darkness is getting closer and closer to him, and the mysterious lady who hires him may very well turn out to be someone else entirely."
Judging by the trailer, Corbijn's visual experiments, seasoned with Clooney's grizzled hair (the film resembles a long music video), have reached a qualitatively new level.
Daniel Radcliffe will play the lead role in the film adaptation of Remarque's "On the Western Front Without Changes"
Or maybe I can shoot you with a photo gun!?
This season, Johnny Depp could be seen in two places at once.
Firstly, in Venice, on the set of the thriller “Tourist” by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck (“The Lives of Others”).
There, he plays a tourist who is in love with the character played by Angelina Jolie.
Secondly, in Puerto Rico, at the Romantic Diary platform, the screen adaptation of the debut novel by the legendary Hunter S. Thompson.
The director and screenwriter of the project is Bruce Robinson ("Withnail and I"), whose last directorial work was the thriller "Jennifer 8" in 1992.
Looking at the work of the poster artists of domestic prison drama, one can even doubt that they were inspired by something.
But you can't approach the issue of implementing the idea literally!
However, at least it's good that the heroine of the Russian film, although a stranger, is not completely bald.
Director Danny Boyle mainly specializes in projects with Adam Sandler.
They have already completed four joint projects: "The Lucky Gilmore", "Big Daddy", "Chuck and Larry: Firefighter Wedding", and "Don't Mess with Gohan!".
In July, the fifth comedy will be released - "Classmates", and the sixth one is in production - "The Wife-Imposter" with Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman.
The schedule also includes the seventh film - the romantic comedy "Jack and Jill", where Sandler will have to play both Jack and his twin sister Jill at the same time.
Matthew Vaughn, who impressed viewers this year with the spectacular action film "Kick-Ass", will be in charge of rebooting the X-Men.
In the film "X-Men: First Class", the director first called on James McAvoy, giving him the role of a young Professor X.
Rosamund Pike will play the mutant telepath Emma Frost, aka the White Queen, Amber Heard will transform into the blue-skinned Mystique, and Michael Fassbender is rumored to become Magneto.
While filming of the new series of Bond is delayed, its new director Sam Mendes is not left with time to get bored.
On his list of projects is the musical "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" and the screen adaptation of Iain Macleod's novel "On the Shore".
The author will adapt the script himself.
Carey Mulligan has been offered the lead female role.
Gary Oldman considers the role of the practical Major George Smiley - the main character in a series of novels by John Le Carre - in the screen adaptation of the thriller "Spy, Get Out!".
In the first adaptation of this work in 1979, Alec Guinness played the lead role.
The new version will be directed by Danish director Thomas Alfredson, creator of the horror film "Let Me In".
Tom Tykwer is adapting the fantasy bestseller by David Mitchell, Cloud Atlas.
According to the director, this is not an easy task (the novel has six parallel storylines), but it is an extremely interesting one.
He has already received offers from Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, James McAvoy, Ian McKellen, and Natalie Portman.
Filming is taking place in Crimea of the international action film by Maxim Korostyshevsky, working title “Soldiers of Fortune”.
It is dedicated to millionaires who have gone to a real war in search of adrenaline to get their money back.
The cast includes Christian Slater, Sean Bean, Ving Rhames, Dominique Monaghan, Oksana Korostyshevskaya, and others.
The film is scheduled to premiere in early 2011.
Sam Rockwell will star in the comedy "Baby Jesus" alongside English pop star Pixie Lott
Megan Fox was fired from Transformers 3
According to the Ragaoype film company, the dismissal is "not related to that interview in which Fox compared Michael Bay to Hitler".
However, the main heroine and new love interest of Shaia Labaf's character is likely to be English model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.
The girl has no experience in film, so she will have to undergo accelerated acting courses.
This fact should not scare the discerning viewer - there are many examples in the history of cinema of successful retraining of models into actresses.
Charlize Theron ("Monster"), Angelina Jolie ("Interrupted Life"), Jessica Lang ("Blue Sky", "Tutsi"), Kim Basinger ("Secrets of Los Angeles"), Jennifer Connelly ("Mind Games"), Gina Davis ("The Random Tourist") and "First Vice Miss USA-86" Halle Berry ("Monster Ball") started as models or appeared in fashion magazines, eventually receiving a well-deserved "Oscar".
They have succeeded in acting (also the beauties Milla Jovovich, Cameron Diaz, Monica Bellucci, and, especially pleasingly, our compatriot Olga Kurilenko.
High honors are clearly within their reach.
In short, Rosie has someone to take an example from.
Valeria Gai Germankina, who received special mention from the Cannes jury in 2008 for her film “Everyone Will Die, and I Will Remain” and directed the scandalous television series “School”, has been appointed creative director at the MT television channel.
The management of the channel believes that it is Valeria who will be able to bring about the desired and necessary changes.
In particular, plans are already being made to film their own series (about teenagers or about vampires).
Germinica also began casting new hosts.
The comedy "Kolotilov" directed by Leo Gabriadze and produced by Timur Bekmambetov unexpectedly turned into "Tricks".
The main theme of the film remains the same - provincial Russian language teacher Slava Kolotilov (Konstantin Khabensky) is rushing to Moscow to see his fiancée, but is delayed to coach a team of street children.
The second plot line of the picture has received a new development.
Instead of actress Elena Plaskina, the role of the capital's bride Nadya will be played by Milla Iovovich.
A third character will appear as an additional intrigue - Nadia's former fiancé Danya (Ivan Urgant).
Thus, in addition to the question of whether the neighborhood team will win the football championship, the dilemma arises of who will get Mila Jovovich.
Due to constant delays in the filming of "The Hobbit" and the presence of a multitude of side projects, Guillermo del Toro declined the position of director.
The studios are trying to persuade producer Peter Jackson to take full control of the project, but he is only willing to take this step if absolutely necessary.
Possible successors include David Yates, who has finished filming the Harry Potter saga, and Neil Blomkamp, whose film District 9, produced by Jackson, was nominated for an Oscar.
The official name of the new director will be announced at the next Sots-Sop convention at the end of July.
Angelina Jolie will play Cleopatra
Exhausted by the rigid schedule, critics and filmmakers raced between the Sochi Winter Theater, where screenings with master classes were held, and the Zhemchuzhina Hotel, where press conferences and round tables were held in a constant stream, barely managing to dive into the Black Sea.
The heroes of the competition films also behaved accordingly - almost everyone ran away somewhere: the confused Asians from Yusup Razayev's "Gastarbeiter" and Dmitry Mamulia's "Drug Other Sky" were looking for their missing grandson and wife, and the fugitive bandit from Yuri Bykov's "Live" was on the run.
The same cops were happily circling their fingers around the hero of Klim Shipenko's detective novel "Who am I?" - which, however, was remembered by the public more for the presence in the frame of the totally naked Zhanna Friske.
Heroes of the domestic show business appeared, and there were a couple more contest entries - in the film "Slon" (Elephant), Sergei Shnurov played a long-distance truck driver transporting a circus animal for slaughter, and Yevgeny Grishkovets mused on his favorite topics - female betrayal, male loneliness, the healing power of alcohol - in the film "Satisfaction", where business partners challenged each other to an alcohol duel over a woman.
However, business events at the Kinoshka film festival also had a noticeable showbiz flavor - not a single one was boring.
At a round table dedicated to the fate of Russian arthouse, the chairman of the fund for supporting domestic cinema, Sergei Tolstikov, set up a lively discussion with critics: “Do you even read the articles in the press that I read?” he sternly asked those gathered.
"I write them," the president of ERVEZS responded helplessly, Andrey Plakhov.
The scandals didn't end there: closer to the end of the festival, the film Aleksey Fedorchenko's "Oveshenki" was suddenly removed from the competition program - it will go to Venice: the Mstora selectors decided that an extra Russian screening would be a hindrance to them.
Previously, Kinoshka didn't get in the way of the giants - in Sochi, films from big festivals were shown several times: this time, for example, Sergei Loznitsa's film My Happiness was in the competition, which competed with Mikhalkov and Virasatkan in Cannes in the spring.
Nikita Sergeevich visited the film of a former Cannes competitor at the KinoTavr festival and said that he liked it.
The chairman of the jury, Karen Shakhnazarov, on the contrary, did not like Loznitsa's film at all - but under pressure from his colleagues, he was forced to give her the prize for direction.
The award for best debut went to her daughter for "Missing"
A terrifying cinematic encyclopedia of Russian life: naive, humane, and rational heroes are beaten, robbed, and provoked to commit monstrous acts without any apparent purpose.
A precisely executed, purifying experimental film, made by a misanthrope with a mathematical education, which calls for only one thing - start thinking.
A debutant with a philosophical education, Mamulia calls films quotes from Mamaradshvili, avoids any events in the script, and claims that the joy of the viewer lies in the effort to understand his difficult meditative films.
The most difficult film at KinoTavr has already been selected for the Karlovy Vary competition – the directorial star has been born.
The impeccably dressed and groomed programmer Leonid reacts to the world with restrained disgust, hiding away in the den of an orderly bachelor's lifestyle.
But a cast-iron babushka descends on the house, a cruel hand of the punitive authorities descends on the hero's head, and he begins a senseless run through Kafkaesque spaces and situations.
"It's sometimes useful to work not only with debutants," triumphantly declared producer Sabina Yeremeyeva from the stage, as she accepted the prize.
Critics thought otherwise: in their opinion, Sabine simply managed to pull out the "inner debutant" from the grandee of domestic art cinema.
And this is symptomatic - these days, in our cinema, bison are moving with the youth.
Not at all the other way around.
Documentary film, shot in a way that blows your mind more than a similar artistic film.
The author is interested in a screwdriver that examines an electric meter and a piece of unsalted butter drifting on a cast-iron skillet - all of this turns the story about an unemployed miner, his rare-breed lover, and her criminal brother into a real oil painting.
The winner of the short film competition, Nikolai Sokolov, applies the black and white stylistics of the French New Wave to the world of sleepy suburbs.
The Yearovsky assembly halls in the story about two schoolboys, one of whom dreams of making a bomb and the other of playing Bach backwards, may seem strange, but for the rare attempt at poetizing the surrounding reality, thank you.
"Three times a year - on the eve of Victory Day, Russia Day, and City Day - about ten aircraft of the An-12, Il-18, An-32, and An-24 types are flown into the sky, equipped with meteorological equipment and technical means of influencing clouds for the duration of the work, and loaded with special environmentally friendly chemicals - liquid nitrogen, granulated carbon dioxide (dry ice), meteorological pyrotechnic devices with iodine silver, and powdered reagents.
The process works as follows: planes at a distance of 50-100 kilometers from Moscow (depending on the length and strength of the rain front) “break up” the clouds coming towards the city with these agents. The particles of the substances condense around themselves with moisture.
As a result, precipitation occurs earlier than planned, and precisely in the place where the cloud was affected."
Work has been underway for ten years on a remake of a science fiction film, in which Michael York played the lead role.
Recently, the director was appointed Carl Rinsch (he already has a remake of "Creatures from the Black Lagoon" on his schedule), who made his name with his advertising videos.
Previously, the project was associated with the names of Brian Singer (X-Men), James McTigue (V for Vendetta), and Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy).
According to the plot, the hero, who is thirty years old, is forced to flee from the death sentence, as society of the future executes all citizens upon reaching this age.
Robert Rodriguez has acquired the rights to a 80s rotoscoped fantasy cartoon and plans to turn it into a big-budget movie.
The original was the result of the joint creativity of director Ralph Bakshi (the film "The Lord of the Rings", 1976) and fantasy artist Frank Frazetta.
The theme of the cartoon was swords, magic, and a large number of drawn cucumbers.
In it, warrior Larn saves Princess Tiga and the entire nation from the evil ruler of ice, Nekron.
Rodriguez promises to pay close attention to creating non-humans and barbarians on pterodactyls.
George A. Romero will send his zombies on vacation for the time being, as he himself plans to work on a remake of Dario Argento's classic giallo film.
The heroes will be brought back to the big screen by none other than Michael Bay - the master of action, explosions, and horror remakes.
The director of the remake will be Damin Chen, who will also adapt the script.
Argenio and Romero had already collaborated on "Dawn of the Dead" and co-starred in "Two Evil Eyes" in 1990.
This time Dario is not directly involved in the project, but his brother Claudio is producing the film and writing the script.
Jennifer Garner and Nick Nolte will join Russell Brand and Helen Mirren in the remake of the comedy "Arthur"
"I wanted to bring more strength to the female character to reflect the situation in China," says Chen.
- Chinese women now run big businesses and win Olympic gold.
Gong Li embodies this strength."
For the second time in a row, you are playing an imaginary character.
Is it a coincidence?
A pattern.
I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I am presenting two films here (at the Kinoshka film festival and the Sochi film market - EMREB).
And in both I play a woman of dreams.
But... that's how the director saw me, that's how he presented me, and many people probably think that's how I am in real life.
Dream girl.
Your co-star Alexander Yatsenko is nothing like his character.
How did you find common ground? What is it like on the platform?
He is absolutely not what he seems at first glance.
At first, I saw him and thought, "Yeah... it's not just me who has to do this."
Probably, without human contact, sincere and genuine, we wouldn't have succeeded at all.
And this contact happened literally a few minutes after we met.
We have become great friends, I'm not afraid to say so.
I told him about all my fears, all my worries, about what I was afraid of, that I was afraid it wouldn't work out, and I asked him for some advice and help, and he gladly gave me that advice and help.
We talked a lot...
I tried to do this because I was very afraid of losing this contact, of losing our mutual understanding.
That's why at the premiere we watched the whole film holding hands.
How did the filming in Sevastopol go?
Sevastopol is the city where I came for the first time.
I have never had any concerts there, nor have I ever gone there on vacation or visited as a child.
This city has a special magic, a certain character, a certain charm.
And it is a city that one wants to return to.
He has his own provincial charm.
A place where no one is in a hurry and everyone always has time for everything.
It turns out that it was not difficult for you to play the part of being in love with this city.
In general, you are extremely organic on screen, which many people, frankly speaking, did not expect.
How do you work with roles?
Are emotional scenes easy for you to do?
You know, I'm an amateur actor.
And I am, by nature, a very trusting person.
If I came and agreed to work with the director, then I am actually putting myself in his hands and I want to be the test that they will use to shape things.
I understand perfectly well that I am more visible, and I, again, ask for tips and talk to the director for a very long time, not even I talk to him, but he has preliminary conversations with me and explains very clearly and precisely what he needs.
And then, through long, many-hour rehearsals, we arrive at the organic quality you are talking about.
And how did you work with the film's director, Klim Shipenko?
I was thrilled with everyone, the operator, the director, the producer, Sasha Yatsenko.
Because I love working with crazy people!
I saw the same thing when I worked with Timur Bekmambetov.
He was ready to go without sleep, without food - and this was exactly the situation here.
Not sleeping, not eating for days - and still, even if it's thunder or hail.
And if something didn't work out, it was a disaster, and you had to do something urgently to make it work.
It's very easy to work in this atmosphere of madness.
And it seems to me that when people are so far gone to the point of painful fanaticism in what they are doing, it cannot fail, because too much energy is being expended.
What scenarios are you rejecting?
What are the criteria for selecting the material you will be working with?
I don't want nonsense, stupid dialogues, films that say nothing, films that don't bring anything.
I don't want to work just to appear on screen one more time.
Do you have any proposals, projects that you plan to work on in the near future?
There are currently no specific proposals or plans.
I am not the kind of person who draws graphs.
The script came in, I was interested in it, and today this premiere happened.

While we are working on the November issue, film festivals are practically continuous in Moscow: American cinema - Amfest, 2togo, 2-t-1 will start in a few days, followed by a festival of British cinema.
And here's what's interesting: half of my acquaintances are constantly discussing who needs to be boycotted and who needs to be supported, for some very vague reasons.
Moreover, when one of these festivals is solemnly closed with the terrifying Chu4 project without English subtitles, no one seems to notice anything.
It's the last thing you want to do, but if you buy a ticket with your money and then stay in the theater to watch giant pixels and horizontal figures of actors, that's what you'll get.
Meanwhile, we have no pixels: "Tron: Legacy" (a sequel to the classic film about virtual reality), "Let Me In. Saga" (an American remake of the excellent Swedish film), "Uncontrollable" (another approach by Tony Scott to the topic of trains) and a wildly detailed account of how the films about Conan, the barbarian, destroyer and governor were created.

AS A GIFT TO THE FIRST THREE CORRECT RESPONDERS - A YEAR'S SUBSCRIPTION AND A BOOK FROM THE COLLECTION
The serial fairytale about the cute wizard with glasses is nearing its end.
And even if fans of the series have already read the book and know how it will end, those who have never heard of the word "Expelliarmus" will stay at home, and the title of the main blockbuster of November is practically reserved for Harry.
By the way, the studios aren't made up of idiots either: in order to prolong the audience's enjoyment and squeeze the most out of the franchise, they decided to split the seventh film into two parts.
So the sentimental farewell to the magical world of Hogwarts will last until next summer.
SOCIAL NETWORK
The history of the creation of the Facebook network
David Fincher's new film is, first and foremost, a story about a paradox.
The film tells the story of the invention of Facebook, one of the pioneering tools in the field of the Internet, which united the entire world, estranged five friends, and made its creator, 26-year-old former Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, the youngest billionaire of the last decades.
Jesse Eisenberg is as great in the lead role as our conflicted genius, an emotionally isolated social outcast with an unpredictable set of motivations and attachments.
Zuckerberg is launching the site for a number of reasons: partly because of his anger at the world around him, partly because of his interest in sports, and partly just because IT'S "cool".
The very idea and its implementation may seem spontaneous and impulsive, but the actual course of events suggests a clear calculation and a well-thought-out business plan.
The strengths of "The Social Network" become apparent from the first frames, especially in the scene before the opening credits, where Zuckerberg is talking in a bar with his ex-girlfriend Erica (Mara): the ringing, tough dialogues by screenwriter Aaron Sorkin gain strength here and do not soften until the very end.
The same goes for Fincher's direction: relatively restrained (except for the Winklevoss twins, who were played by actors who didn't look alike).
The face of one of them was superimposed on another using computer graphics.
Natalie Portman studied at Harvard at the same time as Zuckerberg.
Runna Mara has been cast in the lead role in Fincher's next film, "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo".
Director David Fincher
IN THE ROLES: Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Rune Mara, Justin Timberlake, Ermi Hammer, Joshua Pens
SCENARIO: The gloomy and introverted Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, having hit a dead end in his personal life, sets himself an ambitious task of creating a fundamentally new social network.
As Facebook's popularity grows, relationships with a few close friends begin to sour and eventually lead to legal proceedings.
The color palette plays its role: warm, sometimes sunny, even in the dark it remains cozy, it maneuvers between two tangled chains of events and two separate legal disputes.
There is not much that happens outside the constant discussions in the film: there is not a single death or murder, and all of Zuckerberg's legal troubles are unlikely to warrant even an additional paragraph for his meager page in Wikipedia.
What attracted 49-year-old Sorkin and 48-year-old Fincher to this not very detailed story?
After watching it, there is a persistent feeling that "Social Network" is a portrait of our time, and the understatement in this case is an important artistic technique.
Just twenty years ago, Wall Street was doing roughly the same thing, only on a larger scale - with cosmic egos and big deals.
Now that daily liquidity has become even higher, policy is no longer being implemented at board meetings or in sandboxes.
Zuckerberg wants to be special, he dreams of becoming the center of attention.
Severin (Garfield) is offended that his best friend has a new best friend (Timberlake) and now he has no one to play with.
Winkless (Hammer and Pence), meanwhile, are tapping their feet: who said that rich, beautiful, and athletic people can't also be smart?
(This line particularly amuses Fincher.)
If desired, a black comedy could easily be made from The Social Network.
Zuckerberg is obsessed with the idea of popularity and leadership, but what is more prevalent in his work - the positive or the negative?
And what social consequences will his invention entail?
Is he a scammer?
Or a cunning manipulator?
Fincher and Sorkin will never close the book if there is the slightest hint of something like that in it.
But even that won't be necessary here: in their version of history, it doesn't matter at all.
"What does it feel like to feel beautiful?" is asked in the song "Vabu Wotse A Vsp Map" by Tre Veanez, which precedes the credits.
The hero doesn't know.
The film provides the answer.
Zuckerberg is a representative of the lost online generation, which has a weak understanding of beauty and even less of feelings.
A tastefully made drama about a high-profile trial of the internet era
In the early 17th century, when Ivan Susanin lived, surnames did not really start to appear among people of humble origin.
They were referred to as "son of such-and-such".
That is, patronymics were in use - nicknames based on the father's name.
But sometimes, for example in the case of a father's remarriage, the matronym - a nickname based on the mother's name - was used.
Susanna is just such a case: "Ivan, son of Susanna".
Serf owners of small estates really did manage without surnames for a long time - why bother with them when you have 20 people and they are all always in sight.
But the owners of thousands of estates were forced to give their peasants surnames.
Thus, the serfs of Prince Andrei Cherkassky already had surnames in the early 18th century.
In the 19th century, even small landowners did not keep peasants on the land, but let them go on a lease - let them earn a living and pay the landowner.
Such a peasant was entitled to a passport, in which the surname had to be entered.
In Central Russia, 55% of serfs were released on the condition of paying a tribute when serfdom was abolished.
This means that they already had surnames.
Capital city criminalists have flown in to investigate the explosion in Novosibirsk
Criminalists from the central office and staff from the forensic center have arrived in Novosibirsk to help with the investigation into the gas explosion in a house at Lineynaya, 39, reports NGS.
According to the investigation, the defendants, Irina Urbach and Evgeny Kavun, posing as employees of the fictitious organization "Mezhregiongaz", inspected and repaired gas equipment.
They used low-quality parts, worked carelessly, but charged high prices for their services, according to the agency, citing an informed source.
On the eve of the tragedy at Liney, a man and a woman visited three apartments in house No. 39, where they were changing the hoses of the stoves.
For example, in one of the apartments, they installed a hose for water instead of a gas one.
Kavoun however denies this.
According to him, this is impossible, everything was certified.
As a result of their actions, there was a leak and explosion of a gas-air mixture in one of the apartments.
Two entrances collapsed - one completely, the other partially.
This led to a significant collapse of the building, which killed 13 people.
Earlier, suspects in the case of the explosion of a house in Novosibirsk were arrested.
The scammers themselves came from Omsk.
In St. Petersburg, a marine flood was avoided
Arguments of the Week.
St. Petersburg → Society

The specialists were able to prevent the flood thanks to the closure of the dam a day earlier.
On Friday, the threat of flooding in St. Petersburg increased sharply due to bad weather in the city.
The sea surge flood was prevented thanks to the timely closure of the dam.
The potential flood could have been the 32nd, reports the St. Petersburg publication Nevada.Tudey.
The water level reached 184 centimeters, but thanks to the closure of the dams in the Gulf of Finland, the water level remained at 168 centimeters, which is only seven centimeters above the lower threshold of the dangerous flood level (from 161 to 210 centimeters).
Weather conditions were complicated by gusty winds, the speed of which sometimes reached 20-25 meters per second.
Now the dam has been reopened, the water level has dropped, and ships can once again sail through the Gulf of Finland.
It should be noted that ten meteorological stations on the eastern side of the Gulf of Finland are monitoring the water level situation.
This helps to prevent flooding that may follow the strengthening of the wind.
In Turkey, 8 people have been arrested in a case about defects in the collapsed buildings
Eight people have been arrested in the Turkish province of Shanliurfa in connection with construction defects found in buildings that collapsed as a result of an earthquake.
As reported by Armenpress, this is reported by Habertürk.
More than 20,000 people died as a result of the earthquake that was registered in Turkey on February 6.
The number of wounded exceeds 80,000.
It is noted that the earthquake is the strongest since 1939.
Hundreds of aftershocks followed the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.7, which were felt not only in 10 provinces of Turkey, but also in neighboring Syria.
Pashinyan sent congratulatory messages to the supreme leader of Iran and the president of the country
Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan sent congratulatory messages to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei, and the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ebrahim Raisi, on the occasion of the 44th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.
This was reported to Armenpress by the Department of Information and Public Relations of the Office of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia.
The message to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution of Iran, Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei, states:
"Your Eminence,
I sincerely congratulate you on the 44th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution.
Armenian-Iranian warm and friendly relations with centuries-old roots, a rich history, and traditions are of particular importance to our two countries.
It has been more than three decades since diplomatic relations were established between the Republic of Armenia and the Islamic Republic of Iran, and we are witnessing sustainable and stable bilateral cooperation.
I am confident that the Armenian-Iranian friendship, forged in an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust, will achieve even greater achievements in the future for the benefit of the peoples of Armenia and Iran.
I take this opportunity to wish you good health and many years of life."
The congratulatory message sent to Ebrahim Raisi reads, in part: "Your Excellency, please accept my heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to you and the friendly people of Iran on the occasion of the 44th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution.
Based on centuries of history and mutual respect, the unbreakable Armenian-Iranian relations are of particular importance to the Republic of Armenia.

I take this opportunity to wish you new achievements, and the friendly people of Iran stable peace."

Caption to the video: WW2 bomb explosion in Great Yarmouth is caught on camera
In England, in the port city of Great Yarmouth, an aerial bomb from World War II exploded on Friday, which sappers were trying to defuse.
A powerful explosion was heard for dozens of kilometers, but there were no casualties.
The Norfolk County Police announced that, although the explosion was unplanned, no one from the military team that was handling the bomb was injured.
"The device detonated shortly after work began on neutralizing it.
Fortunately, the entire crew is safe.
The agencies have begun assessing the damage," Norfolk Police Chief Nick Davison's assistant told reporters.
Local residents write on social media that the explosion shook houses at a distance of 24 km.

A 250-kilogram bomb was found during construction work on the bank of the Yar River, at the mouth of which, on the coast of the North Sea, stands Great Yarmouth.
Before attempting to disarm the bomb, the sappers built a protective wall of sand around it, and a cordon, which excluded outsiders, was set up at a distance of 200 meters.
The explosive experts first tried to cut the detonator off the bomb with the help of a robot on Thursday, but the attempt failed, and then they decided, as local press reports, to use the "slow burning" technique to detonate the explosives.
During this burning process, an explosion occurred.
During World War II, the Nazis dropped hundreds of thousands of bombs on Britain.
During the eight-month intensive bombing campaign from autumn 1940 to spring 1941, known as "Blitz", 450,000 bombs were dropped on Britain.
Among Belarusian researchers, women make up almost 40%
In Belarus, the number of women among researchers is 38.9%, reported Belta, citing Alesia Solovei, a researcher at the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences.
The share of women among doctoral candidates and doctors is also growing: among doctoral candidates, women make up 41.1%, and among doctors, 21%.
In all fields of science, except for technical ones, the share of women exceeded 50%.
The most feminized area of scientific knowledge is medical sciences, in which the proportion of women is 64.4%.
Only in technical sciences are men predominant, with women making up 26.7%.
In the National Academy of Sciences, the proportion of women among researchers is 49.1% - this is higher than the national average by 10.2%.
Among doctoral candidates, the proportion of women is 46%, and among doctors of science, it is 20%.
Among the faculty at higher education institutions, more than half are women (57%).
Among the vice-rectors for scientific, educational, and pedagogical work, every third is a woman (31.8%), among deans - 38.7%, deputy deans - 44.6%, heads of departments - 42.5%.
The majority of women are among senior teachers and lecturers - over 60%.
The proportion of women among assistant professors is high (55.2%).
According to a Republican public opinion monitoring conducted by the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences last year, the majority of Belarusians do not support gender stereotypes about women's opportunities in science.
63.5% (56.5% of men and 69% of women) do not agree to some extent with the gender stereotype that science is a male domain.
More than half of the country's residents do not agree that a woman is less competent as a scientist - 66.1% (59% men and 71.6% women).
"The transformation of gender representations of women's research competence in the mass consciousness contributes to attracting young women to science, developing their creative potential, forming a successful role model for a woman scientist, including through the transfer of experience and the mentorship institution," noted Alesia Solovei.
February 11 is celebrated annually as International Day of Women and Girls in Science.
The holiday was established to introduce women and girls to the field of science, encourage women to pursue scientific careers, and recognize women's achievements in science.
According to UNESCO, women make up 30% of the total number of researchers in the world.
The likelihood of a further increase in the key rate is higher than its decrease
This statement was made by the Chairman of the Central Bank of Russia, Elvira Nabiullina, following the meeting of its Board of Directors on February 10, which decided to keep this rate at 7.50%.
The head of the regulator, in particular, noted that important changes have occurred recently.
On the one hand, the conditions of foreign trade have noticeably worsened - the prices of Russian oil have fallen.
On the other hand, the situation in the economy is better than the October forecast.
The shift in demand structure continues: consumption remains restrained, private investment slows down, but budget spending increases.
At the same time, overall inflationary risks have increased.
"Therefore, this year the likelihood of a rate increase exceeds the likelihood of a rate decrease.
The appropriateness of changing the rate will be determined by the development of the situation," said E. Nabiullina.
In addition to the more pronounced impact of budget policy, she noted three risks.
Firstly, a rapid increase in consumption in the face of heightened inflationary expectations, if the factors that restrain consumer activity weaken.
Secondly, there is a growing shortage of workers and a lag in the growth of labor productivity compared to the growth of wages.
And there are still risks of additional tightening of sanctions restrictions.
Speaking about the regulator's future decisions, the Chairman of the Bank of Russia noted that, despite the pro-inflationary factors noted earlier, the inflation forecast for the current year remains at 5-7%.
According to her, this may require a higher trajectory for the key rate than was assumed in October.
In the updated forecast of the Central Bank for this and the next year, the ranges for the average key rate have been raised by half a percentage point, to 7.0-9.0% per annum for 2023 and 6.5 - 7.5% per annum for 2024.
"This does not rule out the possibility of a rate cut this year, but its likelihood and scale have decreased.
On the contrary, the likelihood has increased that some increase in the rate may be necessary in order for inflation to meet the target of around 4% in 2024," the head of the Bank of Russia concluded.
The Bank of Russia has approved the requirements for the procedure for creating special closed-end mutual investment funds (PIFs) consisting of blocked foreign securities.
The regulator informs that such securities will be withdrawn from the composition of existing retail mutual funds.
This will allow the management of remaining liquid assets to be launched and investment share operations to be resumed.
If more than 10% of the retail PIF consists of blocked securities, the management company must allocate them to a separate closed PIF by September 1, 2023.
Each shareholder will be issued shares of the new fund in an amount equal to the shares of the main fund.
It is also possible to change the status of the retail fund to closed.
For funds with less than 10% of blocked securities, the new requirements are not mandatory.
But the management company has the right to allocate blocked assets into a separate closed mutual fund.
In addition, there is a requirement to inform shareholders about the consequences of withdrawing blocked securities into a special mutual fund.
In the future, if such securities are sold, management companies are required to pay at least 90% of the proceeds to the owners of investment shares on a quarterly basis, according to a statement from the Bank of Russia.
In addition to summarizing the industry, experts also gave a forecast for the current year.
According to the Center for Analysis and Expertise of Promsvyazbank, in 2022, passenger traffic on air transport in Russia decreased by 6.3%, and passenger transportation decreased by 14.2%.
The volume of passenger traffic was 95.2 million people, and the passenger turnover was 228.0 billion passenger-kilometers.
International passenger traffic amounted to 17.2 million people, which is 26.7% lower than the previous year, and domestic traffic - 78.0 million people (-10.9%).
PSB analysts note that the industry's relative stability was influenced by government support programs.
In 2022, a program to stimulate domestic tourism was in effect, with 38.8 billion rubles allocated for it.
Tourists could receive a partial refund for tours with flights prepared by Rosturizm.
Several government support programs were also implemented to ensure the availability of air transportation, including subsidies for passenger transportation, the development of regional transportation, etc., with a total budget of more than 27.5 billion rubles.
In the second quarter of 2022, the government decided to allocate an additional 100 billion rubles to airlines and to recapitalize Aeroflot by 52.5 billion rubles.
"Despite the sanction pressure on the Russian aviation industry, as a result of the development of domestic tourism and the opening of new international destinations, as well as the continuation of state subsidies to the industry (so far, 25.3 billion rubles have been allocated), in 2023, passenger traffic is expected to increase by 6.4%, to 101.2 million people (domestic passenger traffic will amount to 91.1 million people), according to the forecast of Rosaviation, or up to 103.0 million people," share the forecasts of PSB analysts.
Terrorist attack in Jerusalem, a 6-year-old child died
Two people, including a 6-year-old child, were victims of a terrorist attack in Jerusalem: a car crashed into a bus stop at high speed.
Another six people were injured.
The driver of the car was shot dead on the spot.
Later it was revealed that the man was a 31-year-old Palestinian from East Jerusalem.
Law enforcement agencies classified his actions as a terrorist attack, the terrorist's relatives were detained, and the house was sealed off.
At the same time, according to reports from Israeli media, the attacker had mental health problems and was only discharged from the hospital this week.
Austria is once again tightening control at the border with Hungary after another influx of migrants in recent months.
Officials say that many people are staying at the border in their cars, waiting to cross into Austria.
This way, it becomes a signal to the Austrian authorities that they have already gone through the asylum procedure in Hungary.
Based on existing agreements, Austria believes that migrants must remain in the country where the request was made.
At the same time, the Austrian authorities consider it wrong to automatically send back to Hungary those who want to cross the border: many migrants become victims of smugglers and find themselves between two border posts without the right to return to Hungary.
That is why, according to the police, increased control is needed.
The decision to tighten checks by Vienna followed a promise by leaders of the European Union to allocate more funds for cameras, drones, and watchtowers to protect the community's borders.
According to the Frontex agency, last year the number of illegal migrants who arrived in the EU and applied for refugee status exceeded the figures for 2016 for the first time and amounted to more than 330,000.
Cargo ship "Progress 83" successfully docked with the ISS
The automatic resupply ship Progress 83 successfully docked with the International Space Station on Saturday at 3:45 GMT, completing a two-day orbital flight.
The docking occurred at an altitude of 269 statute miles above the southern Pacific Ocean.
The live broadcast of the docking was conducted by the NASA Flight Control Center in Houston, Texas.
In Russia, the docking was monitored by specialists from the Flight Control Center.
From the ISS, the cargo ship was greeted by cosmonauts Sergei Prokopiev, Dmitry Petelin, and Anna Kikina.
The Progress MS-22 spacecraft delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS, including 720 kg of refueling fuel, 420 kg of water, and about 1,354 kg of dry cargo.
In addition, the ship delivered food for Russian cosmonauts.
Progress 83 successfully launched from the Russian Baikonur cosmodrome on Thursday.
At the same time, Roscosmos reported the depressurization of the Progress MS-21, which was prepared for separation from the ISS and further drowning on February 18.
As specified by the company's press service, the ship's transition hatch was immediately closed: "Progress MS-21" is isolated from the overall ISS volume.
The reasons for its depressurization are being investigated."
The Zvezda Control Centre also reported that the ISS crew is not in danger: "The temperature regime and pressure on board the station are normal.
There is no threat to the crew's life or health, they are feeling well."
"There have been more cases of birth tourism."
How pregnant Russian women got stuck in Argentina
The migration service of Argentina has begun to suspend and cancel the validity of residence permits for Russians who obtained them through the birth of a child but did not remain in the country.
Earlier, the authorities of the republic denied entry to the country to several pregnant Russian women, who were suspected of having arrived for the purposes of "maternity tourism".
On February 11, they were still allowed into Argentina by a court decision.
For more information, see the article on Gazeta.Ru.
The migration service of Argentina has begun to suspend and cancel the validity of residence permits (RP) for Russians who obtained them through the birth of a child but did not remain in the country.
This was reported to the C5N television channel by the director of the service, Florencia Carignano.
"What we are doing is suspending the residence permits of those Russians who came to obtain a residence permit because their child is Argentinean, but who have spent more time outside (Argentina) than inside (the country)", she explained.
According to her, when the issue of Argentine citizenship for a Russian citizen is being considered in court, the migration service will submit data stating that the residence permit was suspended because this person "spent a month in Argentina and never came back."
Carignano warned that Russians who received a residence permit after the birth of a child and left the country may have it revoked.
Against this backdrop, on February 9 it was reported that three pregnant Russian women were "stuck" at an airport in Argentina due to a refusal of entry into the country.
According to the head of the consular department of the Russian embassy in Argentina, Georgy Polin, the diplomatic mission links what happened to the fact that the authorities of the republic may have considered the information provided by the girls upon entry to be incomplete or false.
One of them arrived on February 7, and two more on the evening of February 8, reports RIA Novosti.
The diplomat emphasized that more pregnant women flew to Argentina, but these three specifically were issued a prescription prohibiting them from entering the country.
"They were not allowed into the country in accordance with the migration law, where one of the grounds for not allowing someone into the country is providing incomplete, false, or distorted information," Polin said.
On Saturday, February 11, the migration service of Argentina, at the request of the court, allowed pregnant citizens of the Russian Federation to enter the country, lawyer Christian Rubilar reported.
"An hour ago, they were all allowed to enter Argentina," TASS quotes him as saying.
Rubilar noted that the migration service changed its decision after the court ruling.
It is easier for a child's foreign parents born in Argentina to obtain a passport of the republic.
It allows for short-term travel to 171 countries without visas, including EU states, the UK, and Japan, notes RBC.
In early January 2023, The Guardian wrote about a "boom in maternity tourism" to Argentina among Russians.
According to Polina, between 2,000 and 2,500 Russian citizens moved to the republic in 2022.
Many of them, the diplomat noted, are Russian women who are planning to give birth there.
"In 2023, this number could grow to 10 thousand," he said.
In turn, Carignano previously stated that in 2022, about 10,500 Russian citizens arrived in Argentina, and in recent months, more than 5,800 pregnant women.
On February 9, it was announced how the prices for rental housing in St. Petersburg had changed.
It has fallen by 10%.
It is known that across the country, rent has become 25% more expensive, reports Patrol Petersburg, citing RBC.
The average monthly rent for an apartment in St. Petersburg at the beginning of 2023 was 27,000 rubles.
A one-bedroom apartment cost 25,000 rubles per month, a studio cost 22,000 rubles per month, and a two-bedroom apartment cost 36,000 rubles per month.
Experts believe that this trend may change as early as the spring, when many citizens who have been abroad return home.
The reasons for questioning women in a foreign country have become known.
The migration service of Argentina did not let six pregnant Russian women into the country, as the purpose of their visit, which they had indicated, turned out to be false.
This was reported by TASS, citing the Todo Noticias television channel.
For five hours, pregnant women were asked questions about the purpose of their visit.
Most of them admitted that they came to a foreign country to give birth.
In this regard, the country's representatives did not allow Russian women to enter Argentina.
As specified in the publication, the migration service has a procedure to follow if there are suspicions about "false" travelers.
For example, if it is noticeable that a woman is in her 33rd week of pregnancy, she does not have a return ticket to Russia, and she cannot clearly explain where she will go on vacation, then suspicion immediately falls on her from the migration service.
Moreover, the specialists clarify that it is difficult to be a traveler "in such conditions".
The artist's decision to leave the theater was planned.
State Prize laureate Alexander Filippenko stated that the decision of the Moscow City Council Theater not to renew his contract was planned, and that everything was agreed upon in advance with management.
He spoke about this in an interview with the Interfax agency.
In the productions in which he took part, artists from the second cast were invited.
The People's Artist of the Russian Federation clarified that his contract ended in 2022.
All the details have long been agreed upon with the theater's representatives.
Moreover, everyone knew that the star was not going to renew the contract.
Filippenkov noted that the authorities agreed and prepared all the documents.
So, he assures that he "did not let anyone down".
In addition, it was reported that the artist emigrated from Russia.
He flew to his heir in Latvia.
Filippenko plans to undergo "long-term treatment" in a foreign country.
As stated in the publication, at the moment, the film actor is working at a Moscow theater as a guest actor.
According to the publication, the artist performed at the Moscow City Council in such productions as "Shakespeare's Hamlet" and "The Taming of the Shrew", "Uncle Vanya", as well as "Three Sisters".
From the private sector areas on Friday, February 10, 340 thousand cubic meters of snow were removed from the Kalininsky District.
This information was shared by the city hall.
At the moment, there are more than four hundred streets in the Kalininsky district that need to be cleared of snow by the spring.
The roads will be cleaned in two stages.
The first will end on February 15th, and the second will take place from March 1st to April 15th.
114 pieces of special equipment and 123 workers will take part in the clean-up.
Authorities reported that contractors are facing snow removal on the roadway by residents of the houses.
Kirkorov won a lawsuit against a fisherman
In the lawsuit, the man claimed that the artist's construction was illegal, but did not appear at the hearing.
The fisherman sued the musician Philip Kirkorov over an allegedly illegally installed pier on his suburban dacha.
This is reported by "Fifth Channel".
However, the Saratov fisherman was not able to win the case.
The complaint against the singer was considered by the Odintsovo City Court. According to the lawyer, documents and design projects were presented in court, which confirmed the legality of all the structures installed on the celebrity's property.
As the head of the law firm, Alexander Dobrovinkoii, clarifies, the construction of the pier did not leave the plaintiff with any chance to go fishing.
The application for the performer was submitted on January 11.
The celebrity lawyer joked that the man probably planned to fish exclusively from the artist's home.
Ironically, Dobrovinsky clarified that he will ask Kirkorov to provide the plaintiff with his balcony for fishing.
He emphasized that from that location, it is possible to keep casting with a spinning rod.
A sleep specialist has named the causes of sleep problems
Sleep specialist Sofia Cherkasova spoke about foods and habits that interfere with healthy sleep.
As the specialist noted, sleep problems often occur due to products containing caffeine.
This primarily refers to tea, coffee, chocolate, and any desserts containing cocoa.
Their use before bed should be limited, as they not only interfere with falling asleep, but also make sleep "restless", meaning it does not allow the body to fully recover.
According to the doctor, it is best to stop consuming caffeine-containing products 6-8 hours before bedtime.
Otherwise, they contribute to lowering the threshold of excitability of the nervous system, and as a result, difficulties with falling asleep occur.
Alcohol also negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
The doctor clarifies that small doses of alcoholic beverages promote relaxation and do not affect sleep.
However, quantities exceeding 36 grams, when converted to pure alcohol, lead to various sleep disturbances, such as shallow sleep and frequent nighttime awakenings.
In addition, to prevent sleep problems, a somnologist recommends avoiding spicy food and large portions.
Large volumes and spicy food contribute to an increase in body temperature, which negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
For healthy sleep, it is not only necessary to maintain an external temperature regime: an optimal temperature is 18-20 degrees Celsius - but also the absence of elevated body temperature.
According to Cherkasova, it is not worth abusing heavy foods before bedtime, as it will not allow the body to fully recover and rest: it will have to spend its energy on digestion.
The doctor also reminded that the lack of healthy sleep and accumulated sleep deprivation affect the quality of life and daily activities, so it is extremely important to stick to a sleep and rest schedule and allow the body to recover.
Bloomberg named the name of Trump's competitor in the upcoming presidential elections: In the world: Politics: INFOX.ru
According to the agency, the former president's main competitor in the upcoming elections will be the governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis.
Republican Desantis has not yet officially announced his intention to enter the race for the presidency, but Bloomberg sources report that he is already preparing for the primaries.
According to the agency, Desantis' team is already recruiting consultants to participate in the presidential elections and conducting preliminary polls.
In confirmation of this, Bloomberg reports on a planned off-site meeting for Republican Party leaders and government officials scheduled for the end of February.
The agency reports that the team of the governor of Florida is seeking support among fellow Republicans from Iowa, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and other states. Bloomberg experts named Desantis as the main potential competitor to Donald Trump.
Specialists consider the current governor of Florida to be well-known enough that he does not need to start an election campaign right now, and they also note his ability to raise money.
Ron Desantis supported Donald Trump's candidacy for president in 2017, and may compete with him in the presidential elections in November 2024.
Donald Trump officially announced his intention to run for president "to make America great again"... during a speech to his supporters in Florida.
The current president, Joe Biden, despite assurances from his team about his intention to participate in the 60th presidential election, stated that there is no firm decision on this issue.
Hundreds of demonstrations against the pension reform will take place in France on Saturday
The fourth day of mass protests against the pension reform is being held by trade unions in France on Saturday.
Hundreds of demonstrations will take place across the country, French media report.
After a slight decrease in the number of participants in protest actions on Tuesday compared to the first two "days of mobilization", the unions hope to bring more protesters onto the streets this time, taking into account those citizens who were unable to participate in the demonstrations on a weekday.
Law enforcement agencies expect between 600,000 and 800,000 demonstrators across the country, including 90,000 to 120,000 in Paris, according to media reports.
On February 7, 757,000 people took part in protests against pension reform, according to the French Ministry of the Interior.
The largest trade union association, the General Confederation of Labour (GCL), announced 2 million protesters.
According to VKT, 400,000 demonstrators took to the streets of Paris on Tuesday.
The police say there were 57,000 of them.
On the previous day of protests, January 31, the number of demonstrators was estimated by the police at 1.27 million and 2.8 million by trade unions.
The next mass protests are planned for February 16.
As reported, on January 10, French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne presented the government's draft pension reform project, which provides for increasing the retirement age from 62 to 64 years.
It is expected that the age threshold for retirement will gradually shift from 62 years to 64 years by three months per year, and this process will continue until 2030.
The new regime will apply to generations of French people born in September 1961 or after.
French President Emmanuel Macron stated during the 2022 election campaign that he was determined to carry out pension reform before the end of his second presidential term.
On February 6, the French National Assembly began considering the government's draft pension reform.

More than 180 accidents occurred in Astana in one day: February 11, 2023, 14:10
ASTANA.KAZINFO.COM - The Department of Police of the capital urges drivers to be extremely careful on the roads, to take into account the influence of weather conditions, reduced visibility in rain, and changes in the grip of the road surface in icy conditions.
181 accidents were registered over the past day.
This was reported by the MIA "Kazinform" with reference to the press service of the police department of the city of Astana.
"Drivers should also be careful on the road, as pedestrians often violate the rules for crossing the road, which also often leads to serious consequences.
This year, there have been 11 cases of pedestrians being hit by vehicles while crossing the road in violation of established requirements, and all 11 pedestrians suffered injuries.
Since the beginning of the year, 35 accidents have been recorded, in which 3 people died and 39 people were injured to varying degrees.

The depressurization of the Progress MS-21 occurred on the ISS: February 12, 2023, 00:12
TASS - KAZINFOCOM - Roscosmos reported the depressurization of the Progress MS-21, which was prepared for separation from the ISS, reports MIA "Kazinform" with reference to TASS.
"The contour of the transport cargo ship Progress MS-21, whose flooding is scheduled for February 18, has been depressurized, as confirmed by telemetry data received at the control center," the Roscosmos press service reported.
As noted, at the moment it is isolated from the overall volume of the station.
The causes of the incident are being investigated, and it did not affect the docking of the Progress MS-22 cargo ship or the further flight program of the ISS.
The situation was commented on by the Executive Director of Roscosmos for manned space programs, Sergei Krikalev.
"A cargo ship, which has been docked at the station for several months, has suffered a leak of heat transfer fluid from the thermoregulation system.
The situation is somewhat similar to what happened to us with the ship ("Soyuz MS-22" - TASS's note) in mid-December," he said, noting that the commission that analyzed the incident with "Soyuz" concluded that the leak was caused by a micrometeoroid.
Roscosmos will conduct an analysis to ensure that there are no problems with the next launches.
"We need to conduct a thorough analysis to make sure that this cause does not apply to similar designs in future launches.
This is the most important task that now lies before us," he said.
According to the CEO, an analysis will be conducted in terms of preparing the ship for launch, the materials used, and the technologies used in the assembly of the radiator.
The same analysis was carried out in the case of the damaged radiator of the Soyuz MS-22 spacecraft.
"The most important thing is to make sure that this is not some kind of systematic error," added Krikalev.
The CEO clarified that a commission began work on Saturday to analyze all possible causes.
"The ship was scheduled to be detached from orbit and deorbited two days before the launch of the Soyuz spacecraft ("Soyuz MS-23" - TASS), so there will be no serious consequences for the crew's actions, for the crew's work... This will not affect the program from this point of view," noted Krikalev.
The Progress MS-21 cargo vehicle was launched from Baikonur on a Soyuz-2.1a carrier rocket on October 26.
Two days later, it docked with the small research module "Search" of the Russian segment of the ISS.
The ship delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS.
NASA has named the location of the "Progress" depressurization
The depressurization of the Progress MS-21 cargo ship at the International Space Station (ISS) occurred in the thermal control system.
This was reported by a representative of the American Mission Control Center (MCC) during negotiations with the ISS crew, which was broadcast by NASA.
Now, according to NASA, the leak of cooling liquid from Progress has stopped.
NASA believes that all the refrigerant has completely leaked out.
"This morning we had a leak of refrigerant from the thermoregulation system into space, the leak of refrigerant has stopped," said a representative of the American control center (quoted by Interfax).
Earlier, the "Progress" module was isolated due to a leak.
Roscosmos reported that nothing threatens the cosmonauts.
The Progress MS-22 docked with the ISS today, February 11, and it will be deorbited on February 18, according to the plan.
John Kirby, coordinator of strategic communications at the US National Security Council, declined to announce a possible trip by US President Joe Biden to Ukraine.
He told reporters about this at a briefing, which was broadcast on the White House YouTube channel.
Kirby noted that he "has nothing to announce about additional points on the American leader's trip to Poland."
The day before, White House press secretary Karin Jean-Pierre announced Biden's visit to Poland from February 20 to 22.
According to a representative of the administration, during the trip, the US president will discuss bilateral cooperation with the Polish leadership, as well as joint efforts to support Ukraine and strengthen NATO's capabilities in the field of deterrence.
Prior to this, Kirby reported that Biden will visit Ukraine when the time is right, but now is not the time for official visits.
A fitness expert spoke about training outside in the winter to lose weight
A fitness expert called walking in winter an excellent way to lose weight without intense exercise
Fitness expert Anthony Young spoke about effective interval training outdoors for weight loss.
His words are quoted by the Eat This, Not That portal.
The specialist called active walks in winter an excellent way to lose weight without intense exercise, as well as to improve the condition of the cardiovascular system and psychological health.
"Walk at a normal pace for the first five to ten minutes to warm up your body and joints.
Then, for one minute, walk as fast as you can, without switching to running.
One minute - at normal speed," explains Eng.
Three approaches are necessary.
Next, the specialist advises doing lunges or squats with weights for 15 seconds, followed by walking at a comfortable pace for another 45 seconds.
This sequence should be repeated five times. Then, Yeng suggests alternating an active step (two minutes) and a calm one (one minute) three more times.
The walk should be concluded with a five-minute walk at a calm pace and a few stretching exercises.
All in all, this workout will take 35 minutes in the fresh air.
Earlier, the master of sports in athletics Maxim Babenkov-Kudryavtsev gave advice on choosing equipment for winter runs in a commentary for Lenta.ru.
"You will need thermal underwear, moisture-wicking clothing, special lightweight, but warm headwear.
Running shoes for winter are made of denser materials, have a higher platform, and have a sole protector," the athlete said.
On February 17, a creative evening of the Orthodox writer, historian, screenwriter, and member of the Russian Union of Writers will take place at the CDL.

The head of Serpukhov checked the condition of residential buildings
The head of the city of Serpukhov, Sergei Nikitenko, conducted a working tour of the territories.
Together with representatives of management organizations, he inspected the contents of apartment buildings and residential homes.
The addresses from which the most applications were received from residents were found to be under the strictest control.
- Many of the comments are entirely justified and primarily concern the cleaning of stairwells and the maintenance of common areas.
The people of Serpukhov themselves are not standing idly by and are actively fighting the problem of vandalism, especially the widespread problem of graffiti.
We will work on the issue taking into account the "Safe Region" cameras, said the head of the municipality, Sergei Nikitenko.
Attention was also paid to the replacement of mailboxes, light bulbs, the installation of wires in boxes, and the late removal of garbage from container areas.
The management companies must solve all the tasks set before them as soon as possible.
The Deputy Managing Director of RZD suggested that the Governor of the Irkutsk Region explore new sales channels
The Irkutsk region needs to continue exploring alternative sales markets, in addition to the Far East.
This includes the domestic market and the ports of the Western direction, including the Azov-Black Sea basin.
This proposal was made by the deputy general director of RZD, Alexei Shilo, at a meeting with Governor Igor Kobzev, the regional government reported on February 10, 2023.
- As practice showed last year, even despite the geographical location of the Irkutsk region, this decision can be extremely effective.
It is important that the logistics services of companies constantly interact with our "counterparts" (ports, operators, maritime transport) and find the best price conditions for transporting their products according to new schemes, emphasized Aleksey Shilo.
The governor noted the importance of stable product shipments, Irkutsk Oblast is one of the richest regions in mineral resources in the Russian Federation and has significant reserves of coal and brown coal.
About 25 enterprises are engaged in coal mining in the region.
The instability of exports has a negative impact on the financial and economic activities of coal mining companies.
Igor Kobzev also emphasized that the Irkutsk region is an export-oriented region, so it is necessary to increase the size of monthly quotas for the transportation of timber and metallurgical products produced in the region to a level that ensures the stable operation of such enterprises.
- Understanding the importance of the Irkutsk region as an industrial center, we, for our part, will try to do everything we can to support transport volumes.
If additional shipments to the domestic market appear, we are also ready to provide assistance in this direction, said Aleksey Shilo.
Konstantin Zaitsev held a meeting with the active citizens of the villages of Granovshchina and Khomutovo
At the request of the head of the region, Igor Kobzev, the Chairman of the Government of the Priangarye Territory, Konstantin Zaitsev, worked today in the villages of Granovshchina and Khomutovo, Irkutsk District.
In the village of Granovshchina, the Chairman of the Government familiarized himself with the work of a new educational institution - the Granovshchina School, which was opened in September 2022.
The facility was built as part of the federal project "Modern School" of the national project "Education".
The following facilities are located in eight school blocks: classrooms, a dining hall, a food block, an auditorium, two sports halls, club rooms, a library, administrative premises, toilets, public recreation areas, and a medical block.
240.8 million rubles were allocated from the federal budget for the construction, more than 512 million rubles from regional funds, and more than 72 million rubles from the municipal entity.
In addition, a regional subsidy was allocated for the purchase of equipment in the amount of 64.2 million rubles.
After the opening at the school, in addition to the children from the village of Granovshchina, children from the Urikovskaya school, which was undergoing repairs, also took part.
The classes are taught by more than 100 teachers, of which almost 90 are subject teachers.
In 2022, a bus was allocated to the school, purchased by the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation under a federal program.
Capital repairs to Homutovskaya Secondary School No. 2 began in 2022.
First-graders were distributed to Homutovskaya School No. 1, while older students are studying in the second building of School No. 2.
According to the renovation plan, the roof, engineering communications, windows, and related elements will be replaced, the facade will be repaired, and the interior of the premises will be renovated.
An important component of the renovation is the re-creation of a heating point with water heating, which was replaced with dry heat.
The cost of all the work is more than 80 million rubles.
Repairs are in the final stage, there are problems with connecting to the power grid - an increase in capacity is needed, work is being done with the power supply organization.
In addition, in Granovshchina and Khomutovo, Konstantin Zaitsev met with citizens, some of whom had their homes illegally connected to electrical networks by developers.
It was decided that the network company would organize a personal reception next week to resolve these issues legally.
- Very often, the issue of stable electricity supply is the main condition when buying a house, because people are increasingly using electric energy for heating.
Therefore, sellers sometimes illegally connect homes to nearby networks, and this is already a reason for disconnection of electricity supply.
Therefore, network companies in those territories where active construction is underway should pay special attention to this issue, emphasized Konstantin Zaitsev.
Anatoly Prokopiev assessed the effectiveness of state support measures for peasant-farmer farms in the UOBO
The head of the UBOO, Anatoly Prokopiev, visited three family farms in the Ekhirit-Bulagatsky district today.
The head of a family farm in the village of Kapsal, Yulia Madaeva, received a grant to develop her farm as a beginner farmer in 2014.
One of the main areas of the farm's activities is the production of livestock products.
The number of livestock is increasing every year, and the gross production of meat and milk is increasing.
Later, thanks to state support, it became possible in 2019 to participate and win a grant in the form of subsidies for the development of a family dairy farm.
Today, the cattle population in the farm is about 150 heads, 60 of which are cows.
In addition, they are engaged in growing cereal crops and sowing annual forage crops.
Thanks to the activities of the KFH of Viktor Katanayev, the area of Kharyashino in the village of Kulunkun has been reclassified as a populated area.
The farm is engaged in the breeding and fattening of dairy cattle.
In 2014, a grant was received for the development of a family dairy cattle farm with 60 heads.
Today, the farm has a herd of 150 cattle.
Potatoes have also been grown here for many years.
The head of the family farm tries to create all the necessary conditions for the team to work and live.
There is now an entire village on the farm.
Anatoly Prokopiev has taken personal control of the issue of building two km of road from the area of Kharyashino to Ust-Ordynsky.
The main activities of the Stalin Mogzoeva family farm in the village of Otonhoi are the breeding of cattle and buffaloes.
In 2020, the farm participated in a competitive selection and received an AGROSTARTUP grant for the development of a meat-focused farming business.
With these funds, a tractor trailer, two press pickers, and a mower were purchased.
The head of the farm increases the number of livestock every year and increases the gross production of meat.
In addition, the family farm grows annual forage crops on an area of 40 hectares.
Stalin Mogzoeva plans to open a fattening facility.
After visiting three farms, the head of the district noted that state support measures are effective, necessary, and essential.
- The government of the Irkutsk region pays great attention to agriculture.
Therefore, state support should not only be maintained, but also increased and improved.
We, in turn, must be the guarantor of food security.
Agricultural producers in the district are honoring this role, emphasized Anatoly Prokopiev.
The border between Armenia and Turkey was opened for the first time in decades to deliver humanitarian aid
The Margar-Alijan border crossing on the border of Turkey and Armenia was opened for the first time in three decades to deliver humanitarian aid to those affected by the earthquake.
This is being reported by Turkish and Armenian media.
This same crossing was used to deliver humanitarian aid from Turkey to Armenia after the devastating earthquake of 1988, notes the Turkish agency Anadolu.
On Saturday, Armenia sent five trucks with 100 tons of food, medicines, water, and other emergency aid packages to the city of Adiyaman in southern Turkey, Special Representative of Ankara in Armenian-Turkish negotiations Serdar Kılıç reported.
He expressed his gratitude to the Vice Speaker of the Parliament of Armenia, Ruben Rubinyan, and the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Armenia, Vahan Kostanyan.
"I will always remember the help provided by the people of Armenia to alleviate the suffering of our people in the earthquake-stricken region," Kılıç wrote on his Twitter page.
The press secretary of the Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Vahan Unanyan, in turn, reported that trucks with humanitarian aid crossed the border through the Margara bridge and are heading to the region affected by the earthquake.
According to Public Radio of Armenia, the last time the car crossed the Margahar Bridge was 30 years ago, in 1993.
Since then, the Armenian-Turkish land border has been closed.
The Turkish agency "Anadolu" cites other data and writes that the border point of Margara-Alijan was last used to deliver humanitarian goods to Armenia to address the aftermath of the devastating earthquake of 1988.
Then, aid collected through the Turkish Red Crescent was sent to the disaster zone in Armenia.
Earlier, Armenia sent 27 rescuers to Turkey and another 29 rescuers to Syria to help in the earthquake-affected areas.
According to the latest data, more than 25,000 people have died in Turkey and Syria from the devastating earthquake that occurred on Monday.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reported on February 11 that 21,848 deaths have already been confirmed in Turkey.
The Syrian side reported 3,553 fatalities.
Relations between Turkey and Armenia are clouded mainly by the fact that Ankara refuses to recognize the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire, and also supported Baku during the First and Second Karabakh Wars.
Recently, Yerevan and Ankara have made several attempts to normalize relations.
In 2021, Armenia and Turkey appointed special representatives who met several times in Vienna to discuss issues related to normalization.
In February 2022, commercial air traffic between Yerevan and Istanbul resumed after a two-year hiatus.
In July 2022, Ankara and Yerevan agreed to open the land border for citizens of third countries as soon as possible.

Crespo named the strengths of Enzo Fernandez, who joined Chelsea for 121 million euros

In particular, he stated that he was impressed with the player's performance at the recent World Cup.
According to him, the 22-year-old midfielder will be an excellent addition to the "blues", as he knows how to play in different positions.
"Fernandez is Mbappé plus Lambert.
If you need him to play in the position of Makélélé, he can play there very well.
This guy also has a good eye for goal, a good shot from outside the box, so if you need him to play as a striker, like Lampard or Eysien, he can do that," Krespo told British media.

Prediction for the match of the Club World Cup "Real" - "Al-Hilal" on February 11, 2023
The final of the club world football championship will take place on February 11 at the Prince Moulay Abdullah stadium in the Moroccan city of Rabat.
In the match for the trophy, Real Madrid will face Al-Hilal from Saudi Arabia.
The game will start at 22:00 Moscow time, and a live broadcast at 21:55 Moscow time will be shown on the matchtv.ru website and the Match! Football 2 television channel.
Analysts at the bookmaker company BETCITY consider the "blankos" huge favorites: you can bet on Real Madrid's victory in regular time with a coefficient of 1.28, with a probability of about 77%.
The success of the nominal guests is available for 11.0 (8%).
Even a draw is offered at a noticeably lower quote of 6.10 (15%).
Do you believe that the teams will not determine the strongest in 90 minutes?
A bet of 1000 rubles on a "peaceful" outcome in the event of a win will bring in 6100 rubles.
You can bet on the triumph of the Madrid team, taking into account extra time and a penalty shootout, for 1.14, and this market for Al-Hilal is going for 5.80.
The team from Saudi Arabia has overcome two rounds on its way to the final, beating Moroccan "Widad" in a penalty shootout and Brazilian "Flamenco" in regular time (3:2).
You can bet that the outsider will not lose to the Europeans in 90 minutes for 3.90.
Analysts are anticipating a large number of goals: the total over 2.5 goals is available for 1.53, TM 2.5 - for 2.60.
"Blancos" are clearly superior to their opponents in the class, whose composition, according to the Transfermarkt statistical site, amounts to only 39.6 million euros.
For comparison: the Real roster is valued at 849 million euros.
In addition, to the horror of Al-Hilal, the main striker of the Madrid team and current holder of the Golden Ball, Karim Benzema, will recover in time for the final.
But even without the Frenchman, Real is performing well in this tournament: in the semi-finals, it defeated Egyptian Al-Ahly 4:1.
The matches of the Arabians were also quite exciting: they drew 1:1 in the quarterfinals and won in a penalty shootout, and in the semifinals they had a dramatic 3:2 victory.
Recommended bet: "Real" victory and TB 2.5 at 1.76.
Guberniev spoke about the fact that midfielder Pavel Mamaev has made the decision to end his playing career.
Well-known television commentator Dmitry Guberniev spoke about the fact that midfielder Pavel Mamaev has made the decision to end his playing career.
"Now it will be possible to cast a bust in the hero's homeland.
He made a big mistake and for most people he will be remembered not as a football player, but as a rule-breaking football player.
But he is still far from Kokorin.
Because no one could have exploited their potential as well as Kokorin.
Despite all his talents, Mamaev was periodically noticeable.
I can only wish him luck and for him to succeed somewhere else," Metaratings.ru quotes Guberniev as saying.
The last club of the 34-year-old midfielder was "Khimki".
The suburban club did not renew the contract with the midfielder in the summer of 2022.
Previously, Mamaev played for Torpedo, CSKA, Krasnodar, and Rostov.
Mamaev is the Russian champion, three-time winner of the Russian Cup, and two-time winner of the country's Super Cup with CSKA.

A tanker with a diesel engine from a previously Russian-flagged vessel was not allowed into the port of Spain
The Tarragona Naval Command of the Main Office of the Commercial Fleet under the Ministry of Transport of Spain has prohibited the vessel Maersk Magellan from entering the port of the city to unload diesel fuel, since the cargo comes from the vessel Nobel, which flew the Russian flag until July 1, 2022, the Spanish Ministry of Transport reported.
"The Maritime Command of Tarragona of the Main Office of the Commercial Fleet under the Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Development has prohibited the entry into the port of Tarragona for the unloading of diesel fuel on the vessel "Maersk Magellan" under the flag of Singapore, because the cargo it is carrying comes from a vessel under the Cameroonian flag "Nobel", which until July 1, 2022, sailed under the Russian flag," the ministry said in a statement.
The measure was adopted in accordance with European Union legislation, which prohibits access for any vessel registered under the Russian flag from April 16, 2022, or that has changed its flag after February 24, 2022.
The ministry clarified that the inspection was conducted on February 9, after which the ban was agreed upon.
The ministry recalled that this is not the first time that ships have been prohibited from entering Spanish ports.
In April 2022, the Black Star ship flying the Maltese flag, which was carrying cargo from a ship flying the Russian flag, was denied access to the port of Barcelona.
In 2022, after the EU, the US, and the UK strengthened their anti-Russian sanctions, they imposed restrictions on the supply of Russian petroleum products, and then decided to limit fuel prices.
Since December 5, 2022, a price ceiling has been imposed on sea shipments of oil from the Russian Federation by hostile countries.
At that time, the ceiling for Russian oil was set at $60/barrel.
Since December 5, the EU has also imposed an embargo on sea-based oil supplies from Russia.
The problems that pregnant Russian women have had with entering Argentina have been explained
According to the expert, against the backdrop of an influx of people wanting to have children in Argentina, the country's authorities have become more vigilant in monitoring the entry of foreign citizens into their territory.
The difficulties with entry for pregnant Russian women into Argentina are related to the fact that the country's authorities are not interested in a mass influx of foreigners who want to obtain citizenship for their children and a residence permit for themselves, and then leave.
This was reported by Lenta.ru, citing Professor Vyacheslav Heifetz of SPbGU, editor-in-chief of the magazine Latin America.
According to him, no country supports such practices.
He noted that Argentina does not approve of turning the country into a transit point, rather than a final destination.
This applies to those who violate constitutional practice.
As the expert explained, the child will retain Argentine citizenship, but the decision on whether to grant Argentine passports to the parents after obtaining a residence permit will be made by the court.
If it turns out that they did not actually live in Argentina and immediately left, citizenship may be denied.
This applies not only to Russians, but also to citizens of other countries.
Recently, as the specialist pointed out, maternity tours to Argentina have been particularly popular among Russians and Ukrainians.
Recall that Argentina grants citizenship based on "right of soil", meaning if a person was born on its territory.
The Argentine passport opens up the possibility of visa-free travel to 170 countries, including EU states and the United Kingdom.
Earlier it was reported that Argentina had begun to revoke residence permits for Russians who had obtained the document through the birth of a child, but had left the country.
Buenos Aires is interested in reducing such cases.
It was also reported that six pregnant Russian citizens were denied entry to Argentina due to suspicion of providing false information about the purpose of their trip.
Hundreds of new fitness clubs are expected to open in Russia
In Russia, citizens are regaining interest in fitness services, allowing market participants to expand their businesses.
This year, more than 400 new facilities may open in the country, primarily small-format ones.
About 400 new fitness clubs may open in Russia, and their total number may increase by 5 percent.
According to "Kommersant", several dozen players may leave the Russian market.
By the end of the year, there will be about 8,600 clubs in Russia.
According to the publication, most of the new clubs are small-format projects with small initial investments and quick payback.
Such data is provided by representatives of the National Fitness Community.
President of the Association of Fitness Industry Operators Olga Kiseleva noted in an interview with the publication that the 340-420 new fitness clubs will be small, while the rest will occupy an area of more than 500 square meters.
NFS President Elena Silina noted that since 2020, there have been more closures of clubs than openings every year.
Over the past three years, their number has decreased by 37 percent.
Independent analysts, however, cite different figures.
According to Kontur.Focus, over the past three years, the number of organizations with the main activity of "fitness center operations" has grown by 10.1 percent, and there are now 5,120 of them.
The industry suffered heavy losses due to the pandemic, but it began to recover as early as 2021.
According to 2GIS, there are 4,500 fitness clubs in Russian cities with a population of over a million.
Russians have started paying more attention to physical activity, as evidenced by the increase in the number of people visiting fitness clubs.
As of January 2023, attendance increased by 9.3 percent year over year.
As Silina noted, if the trend continues, the industry will return to pre-crisis levels by the end of the year.
The license of a management company from Kirov was revoked
The Arbitration Court of the Kirov Region has annulled the license for the management of multi-apartment buildings issued to the management company "Zabota".
In the Kirov region, the regional Arbitration Court has annulled the license for the management of multi-apartment buildings previously issued to the management company "Zabota".
According to the regional State Housing Inspectorate, the court decision was made back in November 2022, but it only came into legal force in February 2023.
The arbitration board revoked the "managing company's" license for several instances of ignoring the requirements of the State Housing Inspectorate.
Currently, all the facilities that were under the management of "Zabota" have been excluded from the register of licenses for the conduct of business activities related to the management of apartment buildings.
Their total area was 64.8 thousand square meters.
All the houses are located in the regional center.
The administration in Kirov knows that they have been left without a management company.
In accordance with the requirements of Russian law, the State Housing Inspectorate informed the mayor about the situation.
Recall that in January 2023, the governor of the Kirov region, Alexander Sokolov, set a task for the staff of the State Housing Inspectorate to eliminate two-thirds of the region's management companies by the spring, as there are too many of them.
The legality of the governor's demands has caused doubts among the communists in Kirov.
They contacted the regional prosecutor's office and asked them to hold Sokolov accountable.
Presumably, the Federal Antimonopoly Service could have taken the same position.
The antimonopoly officials also reportedly asked the prosecutor's office to check the legality of the region's leader's actions.
Wildberries will make parcel pick-up points paid
The Wildberries marketplace will make package pick-up points paid from February 13.
Their cost will range from 6 to 15 rubles.
Now, the packages are provided by the owners of order pickup points.
If they are not present, a fine is imposed.
Starting Monday, February 13, it will no longer be possible to pick up packages for free at Wildberries pick-up points.
Marketplace users received a notice stating that buyers who need the package will have to pay for it from 6 to 15 rubles.
This amount will be debited from the card specified in your personal account.
As the company pointed out, this step will help reduce the use of plastic and will contribute to the preservation of nature.
As follows from the appendix to the offer for the provision of services for the delivery of mail to individuals, the executor, that is, the person who opened the pick-up point, must provide packages free of charge at the request of the client.
They must be designed in certain colors and have a specified image.
The packages are purchased by the owners of PVZs, and if this obligation is not fulfilled, a fine of 10,000 rubles is imposed for each violation.
Earlier, Wildberries customers accused the platform of deducting money from cards whose data had previously been deleted from their personal accounts.
As buyers fear, this is associated with great risks to safety.
The support service, in turn, explained that this is stipulated in the user agreement.
As it states, the company has the right to debit money from remote cards without notifying the client if payment from other sources fails for one reason or another.
The company, commenting on the situation, stated that payments to customers are made with the permission of the customers, and there can be no data leakage of bank card data.
Photos from February 2023.
A beautiful place, especially in the summer, around the sculpture of a mammoth with benches and barbecues.
There is a small park on the territory where you can take a walk with your family.
Large parking lot.
The store is located on the first floor of the Univer City shopping center.
Opening hours are from 10-00 to 22-00.
You can drink coffee and have a snack of fresh baked goods in the store.
There is a small parking lot from the mall.
Friendly staff!
Delicious coffee, a wide selection of syrups and alternative milk.
Delicious fresh baked goods😍😍😍.
Hearty sandwiches.
Convenient cafeteria area
They came with their daughter to apply for a pension.
They welcomed us warmly, explained everything clearly, scanned our documents, filled out the application, and told us how to make an appointment for subsequent appointments.
At the entrance, the administrator and security staff are polite and respectful.
The building is decent, everything is set up for people - there is a hall, a toilet, and it would be nice to have a water cooler.
We came twice and everything was great!
I wish all workers peace, good luck, success, and a decent salary in these difficult times for everyone!!!
Just a great place!
After a long walk on the beach, there is nothing better than sitting by the window with a glass of gin and tonic, waiting for the shrimp salad (which is simply incomparable in taste!!!)
I highly recommend this wonderful place!!!)))
A nice cashier asked me if I wanted coffee in the store or in the cafe, 200 or 300 ml.
I asked for 300 ml in the room.
After a couple of minutes, I am given a plastic cup.
I wanted to be a ceramicist, so I went to the "ceramics room".
They did it to me.
I ask why in a glass, not a cup.
The girl replies that they don't have cups with a capacity of 300 ml.
How does this fit into a person's head?
Ask yourself or in the room, i.e. determine the technology for yourself: pour coffee into a cup or a disposable cup.
Get the answer - in the room, i.e. in a cup.
Specify the volume.
To hear that 300 ml.
Put the person in front of the fact that there are no cups of this size.
Here, they say, is a paper cup, 300 ml.
It is noteworthy that this is the third such case in Green Oasis that I can remember.
It is doubly noteworthy that I was not offered a standard cup so that I could pour the contents of the plastic cup into it and drink the coffee the way I want. I asked for it myself.
A number of questions arise.
1. Are the cafeterias of Zelenaya Okolitsa and Zelenaya Okolitsa two sides of the same coin or are they unrelated organizations?
If unrelated, understanding appears.
If they are related - why has a food and trade enterprise known in the city for its service and quality sunk to the level of a stall at Kazan Station?
Rhetoric, because this is the third time something like this has happened to me.
I do not rule out that this is happening not only to me.
2. Does the cashier have instructions?
I have the impression that she acts on a whim.
I hope I'm wrong.
Please outline the actions you would take for your employees in this case, if you are trying to provide a service.
We really like the circus and have been going there since we were children.
I saw numbers with Nikulin himself.
And now with children, nephews.
I like the atmosphere at the circus and the programs too.
The location of the places is very convenient.
The arena is visible from almost any point, and the backs of those in front of you do not obstruct your view.
The circus is very intimate, family-oriented!
This time we went to the New Year's program.
We were a bit disappointed.
There are a lot of clowns and acrobats.
I would like a room with tricks and more animals.
It's a shame that you can't take photos with animals in the foyer now.
But there must be a reason for this.
And overall, it's a very pleasant place!!
I wish you prosperity and to please us with your numbers!!!
I liked the developer, OfficeBuild, which chooses good locations for building residential complexes.
They use high-quality materials, which fully justifies the price.
We were invited to see the complex before buying, when the walls weren't even built yet, so we could see everything in person, although we looked at so many apartments and no developer offered us this.
Favorite ski resort in Russia!
The most fun is the gentle, sparse forests, especially when there is a lot of soft snow.
But the tracks are boring and short, in my opinion.
The longest on the sector e, there are even fewer.
But overall, there is a great atmosphere, with many different cafes and bars, so a fun skiing mood is guaranteed!
Great job, Peri!
I did everything as quickly and efficiently as possible, the salon was clean and pleasant.
Good service, friendly staff, there is a cloakroom and water.
Disgusting service.
The second time I come to pick up my order at the time specified in the app and wait by the window for more than 30 minutes for my order.
Today, such a service is unacceptable in business!
The response from the "care" service is that we are trying.
At the box office, even without an apology, simply - we are not to blame, it's the program.
You couldn't call to warn them, and you didn't find any other technical means of communication with your previously loyal customers.
Impotent men "try", but business must work.
Thank you all, we're all going our separate ways.
We will not order from you again and we will not recommend you.
A spoiled mood, anticipation of guests, an apology from the hostess - not the best sauce for hot rolls.
I ordered a car (Jeep Wrangler Sahara) through an organization.
The car was supposed to be delivered in 3-3.5 months (as agreed), but it took 4.5 months - the delay was caused by the situation at the border between Lithuania and Belarus (Lithuania was responsible).
I am very satisfied with the car, thanks to the guys - Dmitry, Stas, Alexander - who are always available, provide up-to-date information, professional advice, and a good human attitude.
Thank you again!
We rented a cottage for 4 days for 3 people.
The cabins are clean, cozy, warm (even very warm), and they have their own small kitchen with coffee, tea, sugar, spices, sunflower oil, and all the necessary dishes.
Cleaning solution and a sponge are available.
The drawbacks include the fact that there is not enough space, and the shower in the bathroom is incredibly small.
There are no designated places to store snowboards or skis, and there is nowhere to dry clothes, so I had to borrow a dryer from the owners and stick it in place of a chair, and put a heater under it.
But overall, it's a pretty good option in a quiet place.
Stylish, clean, spacious.
The food is delicious, and the selection of dishes is sufficient for the needs of any guest.
Prices are reasonable.
There is wine and beer for those who want to drink.
I recommend the center of Moscow
A wonderful place with very polite staff, we will definitely come again.
The property has all the necessary amenities, including parking and billiards.
Rooms with good renovations and all amenities.
A beautiful and aesthetic place, we walked around during our visit to Kaliningrad.
I really liked it, both the miniature Russia and the Ozerov Park and landscape.
In winter, there are many natural slides for children)
A very cool tobacco and hookah shop)
We constantly buy here, the prices are low, and the quality is top-notch!
Very responsive staff, who will be happy to answer any questions you may have)
I highly recommend this store for a visit! ❤️
Location is convenient for everyone.
It's normal for me personally.
They serve quickly, unless one of the visitors gets stuck.
It's convenient to make an appointment.
The staff is attentive, they will help, direct, and consult you even if you come outside of business hours.
In principle, it's okay.
Great guys!
Thank you so much!
Everything was done quickly and efficiently, and the prices are reasonable compared to other services.
I thought it was a button to release them, but they are all so clever and did it all for me.
Huge thanks to the young guys!
I ordered a bouquet of 21 tulips with delivery 2 hours before March 8th.
They brought the flowers in a package 6 hours later, as if they had been stolen (there's barely enough paper to wrap the flowers).
Then, when the flowers were already in the vase, I realized that something was not right.
I compared it to a photo on the website and the color was completely different from what I ordered.
I decided to count them again and it turned out that there were an even number of tulips, 20.
Support in WhatsApp responded to my complaints about the color and number of flowers with "apparently they mixed up the color".
The next day I wrote again and was offered a refund of 15%.
It seems to me that this is the utmost degree of impudence and most likely falls under the definition of fraud.
I have already submitted a request to the tax office about the fact that they refused to issue me a receipt.
Rospotrebnadzor and the court are next in line.
I would not recommend anyone to deal with this organization.
I have been going to Samira's salon for more than 10 years for hair coloring and haircuts.
I want to cancel the Professionalism of the master Samira, she does her job perfectly, I am always satisfied with her work.
She always listens carefully to the client's wishes, and the client is always satisfied with the result.
I would courageously recommend this master to all family and friends.
All of her work is always done to the highest level!!!
Huge thanks to Master Samira 😍
I have been to this gaming club and I can say that the prices are great, there are a lot of gaming computers, there are also drinks and food available.
The downsides include some keyboards being broken with buttons falling off, and if we're talking about "normal gameplay", the computers are poorly optimized :(
Therefore, a rating of 4🥸
This place has become our family tradition)
The son goes to his group, and the mother goes to the fitbox in the evening.
The administrators are super-attentive, and the coaches are professional.
They organize themed holidays for children, keep an eye on cleanliness and equipment.
It's pleasant to walk and exercise.
A 6-year-old child can already withstand a strong blow and strong OCP.
Recommended for children, moms and dads)
Best masters!
Irina is just gold!!
She does her work well, is caring, and clarifies everything.
You can always talk to girls about something!
It was the third time!
I would not regret it for anything!
Finally, I can grow my hair after bleaching it!!!
Vita also studies color theory.
Therefore, it will be able to combine blond with keratin in the near future!
And your hair will thank you🥰🥰
The reception master, Elena Polianskaya, is a very responsive master who clearly explained everything that is included in the regular maintenance.
She also provided all kinds of assistance during the repair of my car.
And also thanks to master Valery Ushakov for his attentive and professional work.
He was ready to answer any question.
The work was done well.
The only thing that confused me when I scheduled the inspection was the insufficiently correct information about the work regulations, but when I showed up for the inspection, the regulations were more clearly explained.
I want to express my immense gratitude to the staff of the Administration.
A very rare certificate from the guardianship authorities was needed to approve the real estate transaction, and the staff were very helpful in obtaining this certificate, although they could have refused, as this is not their responsibility.
Thank you very much!
Very nice people work here.
Wonderful, sincere, polite staff, I'm glad I came to this hair salon!👍
Master Nahida did an impeccable hair coloring, haircut, took into account and understood all my wishes, I definitely recommend her to everyone❤️
I really enjoyed the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin.
It was restored for its 800th anniversary and is stylish and clean inside.
There are also cafes and toilets for tourists.
I went on a tour, it was great too.
And I definitely recommend the Russian collection of the Nizhny Novgorod Art Museum - an unexpectedly wonderful collection
I have known Olya for more than 3 years and use her services regularly.
During this time, we have seen Olya develop in her beloved profession, constantly learning new things and expanding the space for four-legged friends, which only inspires admiration and trust.
We always leave our puppy with a calm mind.
Daily video reports will be taken/removed by a zootaxi if necessary.
They will also bring some delicious and fresh ones)
It's a fairytale altogether 🥰
Thank you for your care and attentive personal approach to our pets 🐕💜
The Sytyy Loss restaurant is located near the Medvedkovo metro station.
The restaurant is very cozy!
They prepare delicious dishes.
The menu is varied.
It is advisable to book seats in advance, especially on Fridays!
A lovely well-maintained zoo.
Smaller than Moscow, but just as interesting and convenient.
There were on weekdays - adult entrance 300₽, schoolchild 170.
There were not many people, we walked around and enjoyed looking at the animals.
The mammoth impressed me)
By the way, they haven't seen him in Moscow.
There are a couple of cafes on the premises with reasonable prices, the toilets are clean and free, and we also saw a phone charging station.
In general, I recommend it 👍
A salon at the highest level!!!
I am very satisfied with the services of cosmetologist Kuznetsova Natalia, I only go to her.
I do various types of facial cleansing - both mechanical and with a device.
I am 100% satisfied.
A master of his craft👍
Everything explains in detail about the peculiarities of my skin, I picked out cosmetics that are suitable for my skin type, it's just perfect.
I am now happy and beautiful!!!
Thank you, Natalia!!!
Great club with a huge space, pool, sauna, hammam, and great trainers!
The downsides include a huge number of pensioners in the pool and in the changing room area.
It feels like they come to the club as if it were a public bathhouse!
Particular emphasis on the women's department.
On weekdays, starting at 7:00 PM, there are a lot of people!
I'm giving it a three, and only because of the first visit, when I saw a consultant, if I'm not mistaken, Timur, but I could be wrong.
I quickly processed everything, explained everything +/-, everything was understandable, my son also decided to apply for a card, and alas, the consultants were busy with their own affairs, customers were waiting, a consultant finally approached my son, who knew everything inside out, several times went into the negotiation room, jokingly discussing things, in the end, my son left without applying, the consultant said, well, you can do whatever you want, since I was present at this meeting, I was surprised.
The new office, in a new format, is comfortable and this attitude.
It's a shame that the first impression was ruined, now we visit another branch, and the attitude towards customers does not depend on the change of staff.
The choice is very large, the quality is good (the fabric is resistant to the appearance of lint), the staff knows their range, and they help with choosing styles.
You can dress a slim girl and a child with an unusual figure and height.
They are located near the metro, and there is even a small parking lot.
We recommend it!
He was in September, celebrating his birthday.
In principle, the service and quality of the food were all good: the prices are low, the portions are medium-sized, so you can eat enough or order again.
The only complaint is the reservation of the table.
When I ordered, I gave my number and everything else that was required, after which the bot immediately called me to check my phone.
There's nothing left to do.
When I arrived at the restaurant itself, it turned out that the table had not been booked.
We were lucky that there were free seats and we managed to get in.
But in fact, it is a very good restaurant with an excellent price/quality ratio.
I recommend it!
I went for a cleaning appointment over the weekend.
For the first time, I see such an organized staff that was as attentive as possible to many of my questions, and suggested how and what to do for further treatment of the mouth.
I wholeheartedly recommend it, the only clinic where they don't want to make a profit that I can remember.
A good shopping center.
Everything is here!
A wide range of products.
Variety of shops.
You can always find something you like.
From food to gifts.
I'm not going to this store again.
We bought a washing machine, they said that it was outside the city, so we will take it ourselves.
The manager in the warehouse said where to drive up to the warehouse, when asked if they would "load" it? He said yes. ))
They took it out of the warehouse without the box, and when asked why, they said that's how everything is loaded.
When I insisted, they put two strips of pencil lead in, like it will just go away!
They refused to load it onto the trailer, saying it's not their job, load it yourself, they have delivery )))
When I said that I would then refuse the order altogether, they said, "whatever you want, it doesn't matter to us," and in the end, one of them even went down the ramp to help my father put the car in the trailer.
I am facing such rude service for the first time.
A good shopping center, very clean. A wide selection of shops and cafes with restaurants.
There is a cinema called "Kosmik" and an entertainment center for children called "Nevidalia".
On the lower floor is a large hypermarket called "Lenta".
Convenient, large parking lot, convenient location.
A good supermarket for cosmetics, underwear, and home goods.
A wide range of products, reasonable prices, polite, attentive staff.
Consultants will definitely help with the selection and provide advice.
Everyone will find something necessary for themselves.
A good place to spend an evening.
The staff is very good, a pleasant establishment.
I would recommend that everyone never make a mistake in their choice. The best establishment in Krasnodar where you can relax and everything will be super.
I recommend visiting)
We would like to express our gratitude to Marina Chasova, who was our agent for organizing the funeral.
When she came to us on a call, she took on the responsibility of solving all the issues related to this difficult and sad event, helped us choose everything we needed, was always available and informed us about how things were going.
Thanks to her, we were able to send off a loved one with dignity.
Everything was arranged, clearly organized, as we discussed at our first meeting.
Marina, fully understanding the state of her loved ones, gave advice on how to do things better and simply showed her human compassion towards us.
He is a very good specialist in his field.
Thank you for everything.
After reading many good reviews, I contacted RemStirMash and they assigned me to work with master Alexander.
He began by saying that the next day he was completely free and ready to serve.
We discussed everything and set a time - 14.00.
The next day came - a call from the master in the morning saying that he couldn't come, a complicated application (how is this possible? and where is "completely free"?), and if he could, he would come after 6 p.m. instead of the scheduled 2 p.m.
We agreed to meet again the next day.
15 minutes before the appointed time, another master calls and says that instead of Alexander, someone else can come, but not for another 2 hours.
What kind of tricks are these?
Two days of empty waiting, all planned tasks put aside!
In short, a competent master named Ivan arrived, fixed the breakdown, for which he is thanked.
So don't be fooled by empty promises and don't waste your time.
The evening observations did not live up to expectations at all.
First there was a short lecture with incomprehensible material, then we looked through the telescope.
Everything was not very organized, children kept trying to watch several times, adults crowded around and couldn't let others watch.
The objects we looked at in the telescope were the size of an ordinary star, and you can see them for free without a telescope.
The girl answered the questions in a not very accessible way, not realizing that ordinary people do not know many nuances.
It's not clear why 600 rubles.
An amazing place, one of the oldest Mexican restaurants in the city, it has been around since the early 2000s.
A cozy atmosphere, always friendly service.
The price is average.
Sit down and have 2-3 dishes for two (the portions are very large) + a cocktail, about 2500 rubles👌
There are interesting beer cocktails, based on beer and tequila, such as Macho Boracho, which I highly recommend trying.
Price: 420 rubles for 0.5 l.
And in general, the cuisine at the restaurant itself is very tasty, I don't know about others, but I really enjoyed it, I will definitely recommend it to my friends)
Great store, I've been buying products from them for quite some time, since they first opened.
Good quality products.
I bought a mixer five years ago, and it still works perfectly and is in good condition.
That's why when we did a major renovation in the apartment, we bought everything we needed here.
Excellent service!!!
It is located very conveniently, there is both the city center and the countryside, in general, it is convenient)!
The quality of the gas is good, I fill up twice a week for more than 2 years, there are no problems, the price is great!!!
Kittens are not deceived by a map or cash, and they do not cheat by the liter.
The store is great!
You can choose any model at a democratic price and for any purpose!
The staff is always ready to help with your selection.
I bought a laptop for my daughter, for school, because her laptop broke down.
They helped, found a suitable one, gave a guarantee (for a month) Thank you! 👍
The sommelier is working.
he helped with choosing wine, because it's hard to figure it out on your own in such a large menu.
The experience of working with a sommelier is interesting and charming, Vasily, there are not enough people like him in Moscow.
I ate the pike - it was magical, chef, well done.
The children's menu is the same as everywhere: macaroni, fries, chicken nuggets. I had pizza, it's AMAZING here!
Adults enjoyed the truffle, while children enjoyed the sausage and mushrooms.
My husband ate smoked ribs - they were amazing, soft, juicy, and aromatic.
The staff is good, everyone is smiling and friendly.
We liked it.
A brand new WB order pickup point is located in a convenient location.
Working hours are from 10.00 to 21.00, without weekends or holidays.
There are changing rooms inside the PVZ.
A very good place.
Real professionals work here, who are always ready to help.
There is also a group and chat on Vkontakte for informative communication.
Fast issuance.
It is nice that the goods can be immediately viewed and tried on.
It's great that it's near my house.
Excellent, modern hotel.
The room is spacious, very clean, and comfortable.
Everything stated in the description is available.
Breakfast is included in the price, with a wide selection of dishes to suit every taste.
Convenient entrance, its own parking lot near the entrance.
Hard 5.
A wonderful puppet theater.
We often go to different performances.
Today we went to the play "The Princess and the Frog".
At the moment, this is the best thing from children's performances.
It was very interesting, lots of dolls, special effects.
Even my 14-year-old son went along just for the company, but said it was a very good performance.
We vacationed with my husband for 10 days in January 2023.
The holiday was a success at "5", I liked everything!
I'll start in order:
On the day of arrival, they called to confirm the time of pick-up, gave information about the cost of the transfer (1400 from the airport), we ordered a taxi (at 23:00 the price was 850r), we arrived quickly, there were no traffic jams, they let us through the gate without any problems.
The administrative building is nearby, and we were able to get it done quickly, in about 15-20 minutes.
All buildings have an elevator, which is a big plus!
The 2-bedroom room is spacious, with warm floors in both the room and bathroom (without heating), a huge balcony with rattan furniture (table and two chairs), panoramic windows (in building 5).
The furniture in the room is normal, there is a ladies' desk with a large mirror, the fridge is not very small, and there is even a freezer.
There are a lot of green plants in Building 5.
Everything is clean, towels and linens are changed at your request, but if you do not ask for a change, they will still be changed on the fourth day, and the linens are of good quality.
The territory is well-maintained, there are benches everywhere, the paths are clean, and there is beautiful lighting at night.
A minibus runs to the beach and back every 30 minutes.
5 minutes to the nearest public transport stop.
In the dining hall, the friendly guys always wish you a good day.
The food is decent, but everyone has their own preferences, we were all satisfied, and the choice and quality were always good, whether it was fish, chicken, or bites, or whatever, vegetables as a side dish every day, homemade baked goods tasty, more than four drinks, coffee beans, they always make pancakes for breakfast, but the cheese and sausage are not very good.
The medical staff is very friendly and loyal.
We were also lucky with the weather, there was no rain, the temperature was 11-16°C, and the sun was shining.
Everything was great, we really had a good time.
There is a desire to come again, and specifically in January, when there are fewer vacationers).
It's a shame that the swimming pool and the fitness complex will not be put into operation.
Thank you to the entire team of the sanatorium for their coordinated and high-quality work!
We have been going to "Poleot" since August.
My daughter turned 4 in September.
Everything suits her just fine, the coach praises her) that's the most important thing.
Let's go to Valeria Nikolaevna Pleshkova!)
I never would have thought that my daughter is so flexible!
While wandering the streets of St. Petersburg, my friends and I decided to check out this promising establishment - and we were not disappointed!
Prices are very affordable, and the incredibly delicious pizza is gone in a flash, not even the crusts are left.
A pleasant atmosphere and charming staff, in short, I recommend it :)
It just so happened that I ended up in the Tomarovsky hospital with high blood pressure and a rapid heartbeat.
I was extremely surprised: the cleanliness, order, wet cleaning twice, moreover, the windowsills, furniture, and doors are wiped down.
The baby food is good, but excellent!!!
I was surprised that at 7 a.m. they bring tea with a sandwich (bread, butter, cheese), so to speak, a pre-breakfast.
The medical staff is sensitive, everyone is putting injections both intramuscularly and intravenously!!!
While the drip is running, they will come in, ask how you are feeling...
I have had heart ultrasounds before, but this is the first time (unfortunately, I do not know the name of the doctor, a young man).
Special thanks to the treating doctor Vetokhina Klavdia Fedorovna!
A true professional: attentive, knowledgeable, provides a comprehensive answer to any question; she selected the dosage and medications that normalized both blood pressure and heart rate, which I was previously unable to achieve after consulting with other doctors.
A huge thank you to the head doctor, Mevsha Olga Vladimirovna, who organized the smooth operation of the hospital!!!
Thank you to the medical staff, the nurses, and the porters!
The impression left after visiting the customer service department was good.
I met the administrator at the chole.
Competent and polite specialists quickly and patiently help clients with all their questions.
The specialist assisted me in submitting the application and provided clarification on my question.
For a small store, this is a very good selection of products.
There are semi-finished products, milk, vegetables, household chemicals, and various small items.
It is open 24 hours a day, which is very convenient, and the staff is always friendly
It's cool when there's a place in the city where you can go skiing.
The bungee lifts do indeed have a queue on weekends, with a wait of 40 seconds to go up and 5-10 minutes to go down.
But overall, it's great, immersing yourself in the atmosphere of positivity and winter, even if there is mud and dampness on the roads.
I contacted a service for repairing an iPhone 11 Pro.
The rear window was smashed and the battery needed to be replaced.
I contacted the master directly, Alexander, who explained all the details of the repair and immediately indicated the price range.
Thank you for the repair, everything was done well.
The masters are very pleasant to talk to, they will show everything and tell everything.
However, when replacing the parts, the camera was hit, and the focus was off.
I immediately reported the problem and received a quick response.
The error was corrected as soon as possible, everything is working properly.
There are good specialists in this service, with whom it is pleasant to have a dialogue.
Prices, compared to other services, are reasonable, affordable.
If repairs are needed again, I will definitely contact you!
Large-scale, beautiful, atmospheric.
But, like most historical objects, its condition requires close, prompt, and high-quality attention from restorers.
Therefore, 4 and most of these stars are given to creators, not maintainers
Great apartment building
Responsive concierges, garbage is collected, the area is clean and beautiful, close to bus stops, schools, and shops.
20 minutes to the metro by public transport
We have opened a nice, cozy place for recreation in our area.
There are all the necessary shops.
A killing and diverse food court in terms of food.
The tables are located in cozy areas.
There is no monotony.
Well, we've been there, we've tried it...
The interior has nothing in common with a cozy Italian café...
There is very little space, the tables are rectangular, just like in the dining hall.
Pizza... well, who hasn't tried something tastier, so it seemed somewhat faceless to me.
I didn't really like the fact that the waiter was standing behind you the whole time and was almost always looking your companion in the face.
We were uncomfortable.
Connolly, yes, they are delicious.
We will not come here again and I will not recommend it to my friends.
Lena Grosskopf is the best hairdresser I have ever been to.
She does everything very carefully and well, I enjoy going to her, I understand that everything will be done perfectly.
I only take my daughter to Lena too.
The atmosphere in the salon is amazing.
Thank you so much!
We broke down on the way from Nizhny, and the kind people from KatResurs quickly responded and helped us!
Respect to you and prosperity, there should be more people like you!
And the server is clean and well-maintained there!
We went to see Sergei Chigarkov's concert.
Excellent concert venue, great sound and atmosphere.
We will definitely come to the planned concerts this year.
A peaceful place, a wonderful Georgian restaurant, on weekends and holidays live music is played!
The staff is pleasant and responsive!
There is a children's room.
Delicious Georgian cuisine!
The rating is the highest, I adore this place ❤
The park is in the city center, very easy to get to.
The park is clean, there is space for both children and adults.
But there has been no sand in the children's playground for a long time, and there is still dust left.
There is also a fenced football field, which, unfortunately, is not very well maintained.
But there are more advantages in our park.
Spacious hall, clean, clear layout of goods.
There are products that can only be bought at the Crossroads.
The staff is friendly.
I didn't get any bad products.
Often there are promotions and discounts.
It's good that it's close to home.
You can always find a parking spot.
I have been to the bar twice and everything was great, the staff was polite, the food was delicious, and most importantly, the music was excellent, the DJs know what they are doing.
The only thing is, the second time the lead singer of the group "Ruki Vverh Band" disappoints.
Not only does he sing poorly, but he also reads the lyrics of most songs from his phone, which was particularly striking when it was songs by the group "Ruki Vverh".
It doesn't make sense somehow (performing at the Hands Up bar, in the Hands Up Band).
We vacationed in early March.
A good hotel, pleasant rooms.
On his birthday, they gave him a room with a view of the Kremlin.
Room cleaning every day.
Refilling water, tea, coffee, shampoo, and changing towels.
Breakfasts are just a waste of time.
There is a mini bar with crazy prices.
If you want to order room service from the restaurant, add 20% to the bill for service.
The prices in the restaurant are slightly overpriced.
Tastes three times better.
The water park was included in the cost of accommodation.
The water park itself cannot be called the best in Russia.
But the masseur was just amazing.
Everything is fine, but the departure was a bit disappointing: no goodbye or good road.
The employee at the entrance didn't even help open the door when he saw women with a bunch of bags and suitcases.
This needs to be worked on to maintain the brand.
A great place to get together with friends for a sauna.
There is a large and comfortable sauna, billiards, an outdoor pool, and karaoke.
The food is delicious, the drinks are fresh)
The workshop is top-notch!
In a short time, he has already repaired 3 pairs of shoes (2 men's and 1 women's).
Everything is fine.
Quality work at height.
Special thanks to the master for his careful attitude and quality work!
A wonderful basketball school!
My son is 5 months old and he loves it, he looks forward to every training session.
An individual approach to children, interesting activities, a warm and friendly atmosphere.
The store is great, the staff will go, I will order online myself.
Excellent location of the store.
Plus, there are always discounts and promotions, which is also good
A good AV store - convenient location, large hall, good assortment.
Special thanks to the staff for their responsiveness!
There are cafeterias with several tables.
I often go there - everything is fine!
Nice pool!
I'm specifically talking about the "froglets", our coach Anastasia Vitalyevna is very liked by the child and is professional!!
The locker rooms are clean, the water is warm, and there are hairdryers!
I love the bakery's croissants, service, croissants, breakfasts, and coffee are always top-notch.
But alas, not this time, I ordered coffee and a couple of croissants, the girls at the counter didn't make the coffee until I reminded them, they made it, but it was impossible to drink, it smelled bad and left a taste of spoiled milk, I decided not to finish it and just left.
Last time there was a long black hair in my coffee, it was replaced.
Please be more careful, I am a guest returning here, even after such incidents.
Gorgeous eyebrows are here!
Victoria adjusts perfectly, taking into account all the proportions of the face individually.
Correction with warm wax, which effectively removes all the fluff, and the eyebrows look neat for a long time.
The color is chosen based on the type of hair and skin, which is why the paint lasts a long time.
It's better not to do eyebrows!
Thank you so much for organizing my mom's move!
Moving is always a huge stress, but with your company everything went very smoothly, quickly, and efficiently.
Special thanks to Vadim and Roman!
I will recommend your company to all my friends!
Everything is at the highest level.
We have been going to NovoDent to have our teeth treated as a family for a long time.
Recently, we had our 8-year-old son's teeth treated, and everything went perfectly, the child is calm and ready to come again.
You don't have to wait long, there are no queues because appointments are made in advance.
In my opinion, the tastiest shawarma in Tambov is only here, I'm not a fan of shawarma, BUT when I want something unhealthy, only here and only here.
Tasty, fresh meat with a lot of fillings.
And I don't understand why, but it never flows out of me.
Often when you finish a shawarma, you can't eat it anymore because there's a lot of sauce and water, in short, fufuu... But not here.
That's why you guys are the best🙂
Good teaching staff.
The food in the dining hall is always fresh.
Interesting lessons are held at the school museum, and various events are held throughout the school year.
Nice store, polite staff, not bad selection.
However, the big downside is that the goods that are brought in seem to be destroyed right in the store.
Sometimes there is not much space to walk between the rows, and it is also not very pleasant when the goods are just lying on the floor, without any crates, but this is more of a comment on the organization, rather than on a specific store.
A delightful example of Soviet architecture.
Strict grandeur, which is carefully tended to.
I had double the pleasure from the concert, thanks in large part to the atmosphere at the cultural center.
While we waited in the hallway, I clearly felt that I had come to the Event, that this was really my coming out into the world.
I was looking for a set of clutch plates for my MB Sprinter.
I stumbled upon this online auto parts store completely by accident.
I called, gave my vincode, they said wait)
After 10 minutes, they called back and offered several options.
Since the car is a personal workhorse, he didn't want to skimp and asked for a good set of LUK clutches to be ordered.
Another 5 minutes later, they called back and said that there was good news for you.
If you don't take the entire basket + disc + scraper, but instead take the LUK basket + disc set and the LUK scraper separately, it will be cheaper by 2 thousand rubles, which couldn't be more disappointing.
I took the clutch to the service.
When removing the gearbox, it was discovered that a flywheel was also needed, and the faster it was done, the better.
I already knew where to go), the manager understood the situation and ordered without pre-payment over the phone (the first time I also paid when I received it).
The following day, the crankshaft was in their hands.
The car is happy with the new crankshaft and clutch, I'm happy that everything came quickly, that they went out of their way.
I will definitely recommend and use vinkod.shop in the future.
The New Year's party was a great success, but with some nuances.
I booked a two-person table, but they sat me at a four-person table.
But no big deal.
It's just strange that they didn't warn us.
The kitchen was a four, the fish was a complete failure.
The host with competitions made at the school level, to be honest, is not very good.
BUT everything is perfect when it comes to music.
The atmosphere was at its best.
Everything else seems like nitpicking.
Thank you for the event.
I am leaving my review, with words of gratitude to all the staff of maternity hospital number 7 in Chelyabinsk.
Only people who know and love their work work at this institution, the doctors and nurses are the best.
Both in the obstetrics department, the maternity ward, and the postpartum ward.
But I would like to express special thanks to Kotlyarova E.Y., the head of the maternity ward on the 5th floor, and Yarantseva N.V., the obstetrician in the maternity ward, thank you so much for your help with the birth of my daughter, for your kind hearts, and for your great professionalism.
A wonderful store.
A wide range of balls, always fast order processing and delivery.
Professional staff.
Very beautiful bouquets, always left with great taste, always fresh flowers.
We visited the establishment on the recommendation of someone.
The food is amazing, the programs are nonexistent, the waiters are a bit cheeky, but we were in great company with children and celebrating an important event, they were friendly.
There was no fire delivery of the plateau, the children were waiting.
You can safely go for good food.
