The July issue is traditionally published during the Moscow Film Festival, and this, of course, is very sad: to read the pages when your soul yearns for Shabrova.
However, we will talk about the MIFF next time (for now, I will just complain that this year, the organizers' unexplainable notion that happy ticket buyers are infinitely more important to the festival than accredited guests, a ridiculous and quite offensive principle that no normal film festival in the world is guilty of, has finally taken root in their minds), and in this issue, we will report on what we saw in Cannes and at the Kinotavr festival.
The cover of the July issue features another pleasant face - the main character of the film "Predators", produced by Robert Rodriguez, and inside the magazine, try to read the story about "The Beginning" by Christopher Nolan (a man, by the way, who rebooted "Batman..."), the most - without any nonsense - anticipated film of the summer.
And this time we are publishing the first part of a rather detailed guide to the works of Alfred Hitchcock, and here it is definitely not necessary to advertise anything, and I understand that the author of "Suspicion" and "Rope" is our Tatyana Aleshicheva, Boris Glaizerov, Anna Golovnya, Nick de Semlin, Dan Joling, Tamara Dondurey, Nikolai Karayev, Denis Korsakov, Maria Kuvshinnova, Ivan Kulikov, Will Lawrence, Sergey Mезенov, Sergey Natapov, Ian Nathan, Kim Newman, Zaira Ozova, Nev Pierce, Alexei Prostiak, Seraphima Skibyuk, Adam Smith, Mour Soboleva, Vasily Stepanov, Alexander Strelkov, Ollie Richards, Oleg Tishchenkov, Alena Logunova, Chris Hewitt, Olga Shakina, and the London-based journalist Evelyn Salt, despite her brilliant record, were suspected of spying for the Russians and decided to catch her at all costs.
Cornered, it will change its color to the familiar black and go out to find the truth on its own.
Another action film with Angelina Jolie in the role of a fatal femme fatale promises to further cement the actress's position in the action genre.
She will cause one accident after another, run around the walls like in The Matrix and throw strong men around like children, all while wearing identical strict suits.
That's how beauty should save the world.
Here he is, the native one, who blew up and fixed the world with "The Fifth Element" and made Milla Jovovich the most beautiful woman in the universe.
For Bruce Willis, he was the most superheroic guy, and Gary Oldman was the most stylish and impeccable embodiment of Evil.
And yet, all together, it turned out to be not a tedious blockbuster of the American type about saving humanity, but a lovely living carnival.
What Beson did for 13 years between Elementary... and Adèle... is not something I want to remember.
He was, to put it mildly, not idle, but all this script-writing and producer fuss and rare, forced directorial performances will be forgotten.
But “Adele...” is hardly the case.
When you watch this movie, it seems like the 13-year-old we see is not our Besson, but some kind of doppelganger.
And he, the real one, lived in a small apartment in Montmartre, drank wine in a cafe across the street, and wrote a story about an alluring adventurer.
Retelling the plot (even in general terms), whipping up expectations, is more sinful than usual in this case.
Here, the incredible drive lies in the fact that surprises await you after every turn or reply.
And they are all pleasant.
Whether it's a girl or a vision
ADEL'S UNUSUAL ACCESSORIES
The most exciting adventure film of the decade hints that "The Extraordinary Adventures of Adèle" will start like "Amélie", head towards "Jurassic Park", continue with "Indiana Jones" and "Mumiya", and end with "Titanic".
The film is based on the first volume of Jacques Tardi's comic book about journalist Adèle Blanc-Sec.
Louise Bourgoin, before Adèle, appeared in only three films.
The actress became famous for her role in "The Girl from Monaco", for which she was nominated for a Cesar Award.
The director doesn't run after the audience with outstretched arms, begging them to appreciate the special effects, sets or stunts, but rather captivates them, like an old-fashioned novelist exclaiming before a great journey to the center of the earth or to the edge of the world: "Come on, my reader, great things await us!"
At the same time, Leos Carax treats genre cinema, which he knows everything about, unceremoniously and playfully, like a boy who has watched old films and read Jules Verne.
By manipulating banalities, without denying oneself cynicism and not being shy about taking risks
Director: Luc Besson
IN ROLES: Louise Bourguignon, Mathieu Amalric, Frédéric Beigbeder, Gilles Lellouche
SYNOPSIS: Strange things were happening in Paris in 1912.
The city was thrown into a frenzy by an ancient monster that an old medium brought back to life.
The police are chasing after the fossilized animal, as well as a famous hunter, a couple of scientists from the natural history museum, and journalist Adele Blanc-Sec, who has a case not so much with the beast itself, but with the medium - she needs to save her sister.
For the same purpose, the girl is dragging a real mummy from Egypt.
RELEASES ON JULY 22
“Adele...” is an example of a parody that becomes the pinnacle of the genre and is capable of radically changing it, directing it down a new path.
This was the case with Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, with Quentin Tarantino's gangster films, with the aforementioned "Indiana Jones" (they paid tribute to it and made fun of it), and finally, with the same "The Fifth Element".
Besson's style in this film is made up of verbal trickery, actorly clowning, and narrative equilibristics (circus terms are entirely appropriate - the union of the two arts here is organic and stronger than ever).
A few words should also be said about Adele herself.
It embodies an undeservedly forgotten type of adventuress, who is driven not so much by the exploitation of sexuality as by pure courage and daring.
In movies, such girls are usually paired with some guy who is a bit of a macho or a wimpy romantic
TEXT: ALEXANDER STRELKOV
Face to face with history
There is only a timid and comical admirer, who only dances around (his knowledge of zoology is the only useful thing about him).
Therefore, the energetic girl doesn’t waste time on trivial love affairs, but spends her time having fun in the company of ancient corpses, which, by the way, play a key role in the plot.
Luc Besson, who has been trained in numerous genre "cats" and seemed to have completely lost his edge, showed unexpected creative mischief, reminding us that the line between the preferences of bored visitors to mega-malls and the discerning patrons of art-house cinemas is easily crossed by films for cheerful eccentrics.
Playing adventure cinema without sadness, fear, or reproach
DEATH ROOM
A hermetic horror with pretensions to psychological depth and a political context, Jonathan Liebesman's debut horror film in 2002 was panned by critics, but was well-received by audiences and did well at the box office, and most importantly, caught the eye of producer Michael Bay.
That's how the young director ended up at a factory that churns out new horror movies based on old formulas: Bay set out to remake the entire horror classics and commissioned Liebesman to make the prequel to "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (2006).
Critics scowled again, but the public liked it again - Leibessman worked in the spirit of the "new horrors", which emphasize the excessive physiological nature of violence.
In general, his example shows how an entire genre is convulsing, trying to invent new ways of reaching an overstimulated audience: the gory splatter of naturalistic films blends with the chase scenes of slasher films.
The plot is reminiscent of the “Saw” franchise, but without the gallons of blood.
Among the prototypes is Vincente Natali's debut film, "Cube". The film was not made by Michael Bay.
So, in "The Death Room", Libesman had to take a different approach: instead of a mindless slaughter or a monotonous chase by a maniac, he preferred a more intelligent option - almost without the notorious bloodshed, but with psychological games and puzzles.
The evil doctors here play cat and mouse with their test subjects.
And three men in a locked room try to work out a survival strategy: to band together as a team or shoot each other?
Play by the rules and obey orders from outside?
Or try to break out of their cage at any cost?
They are not the only ones being tested; a young, ambitious employee of the intelligence agency is also being tested for ruthlessness by an experienced professor who is well-versed in wild experiments.
STORY: For $250, four volunteers sign up for a simple test.
They are put in an isolated room and given a stack of sheets with meaningless questions.
Then a polite man in a white coat enters the room, introduces himself as a doctor, and shoots one of the test subjects in the head.
The game of survival begins, which government agents are closely watching through the window.
Too thoughtful for a horror film, but not enough for an outright art house film
He can conduct a secular conversation and drive a fire extinguisher through someone's face, but he is incapable of passing up a single skirt.
On the contrary, the charming Nastya is careful and unyielding in her affections.
She is offended by her father's courtly lifestyle and openly spies on him as he dives into the pool for another romantic victim, as if parodying the famous scene from Paul Verhoeven's Showgirls.
The daughter rebels, and the father tempts her young suitor from a poor family with money.
But the main topic of the family conflict is not the difference in generations or the choice of profession, which is, one way or another, already predetermined, but the unsuccessful attempts of the girl to refute the obvious idea that in modern Moscow everything is bought and sold.
Mher Mkrtchyan, who is known for his weak melodramas, made a comedy with Ivan Ugryant called "Three and a Snowflake" together with Pavel Bardyn.
Depardieu convincingly portrayed the father of a growing daughter in a comedy genre
The fragmented plot revolves around the love affairs of the characters, who are always talking about psychology, but themselves, apparently, emphasize the language of the look and gesture, thanks to a witty directorial discovery.
The secondary storylines (the girl who was injured in a car accident and whom Alexei wants to marry, the alcoholic athlete played by Sergei Gorobchenko) are, alas, only sketched in.
It is especially a shame that the line about the business of buying up football players was left out.
SYNOPSIS: The fate of his underage daughter Nastya is of utmost concern to the soccer star sales agent.
The good-hearted dad changes his girlfriends like expensive shirts, but his daughter is about to turn eighteen, and she absolutely must marry a guy with "backbone".
What a disappointment for the businessman when Nastya, in the struggle for independence and in defiance of her father, chooses her peer and business partner.
However, with a potential slogan for the film's audience, the author hit the mark: "Don't look for a problem where there isn't one". More precisely, you can't say it.
Their resemblance is simply impossible not to notice.
In both films, there are groups of tough guys, lucky soldiers, who are forced to take revenge on those who betrayed them, and in each company there is one beautiful girl.
The heroes race through practically the same parts of the world (both films begin in Latin America and end in the port of Los Angeles) and exploit the same spectacular scenes - in both places something stuffed with dollar bills explodes and a whirlwind of bills descends on the set.
Even the villains, dressed in expensive costumes, are not easy to distinguish from each other (they are played by both Patrick men - Jason Patrick here, Patrick Wilson there).
Zoe Saldana's previous role was as Neytiri in Avatar.
Sylvain White used to shoot dance battles - "Dance Brothers".
Chris Evans was recently called to play the hero of other comics: he will be Captain America.
Director Sylvain White was inspired by a series of comics that came out in the 1970s and was rebooted in the 2000s, and Joe Cornish was inspired by a comedy series from the 1980s.
It's just amazing how, without coordinating, they brought different material to an absolutely identical, thundering motif, making rather heavy, predictable, unnecessary action movies that evoke a lot of images with Willis and Schwarzenegger (comparisons invariably go in favor of Bruce and Arnold).
If you have to choose between the two films, then Lusers looks a little bit more appealing and is clearly more successful in terms of efficiency (after all, the budget is three and a half times less).
At least there's Zoe Saldana, who looks great in a bikini.
IN THE ROLES: Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Zoey Saldana, Chris Evans, Patrick Wilson, Idris Elba, Columbus Short
SYNOPSIS: During an operation in the Bolivian jungle, a group of experienced commandos working for the CIA was betrayed by their own superiors: the helicopter with the children they were trying to rescue was blown up, and the soldiers themselves were considered dead from that moment on.
But they are alive — and intend to take revenge on the scoundrel with the deep voice who orchestrated the whole thing.
All of this is nice, but, to be honest, it's only worth spending an hour and a half of your life on a White painting if you have absolutely no other options.
Made from recycled materials, a conditionally edible beetle larva
A simple story about a Romanian convict on the run
A Romanian low-budget film that won an award at a prestigious international film festival.
In principle, with only these data in hand, it is possible to vividly imagine the hypothetical content of the painting, and even some specific details of the form.
Without a doubt, the film promises to be highly topical.
Of course, it will be realistic, and tough at that.
There is a high probability of the participation of non-professional actors.
There will also be a lot of Romanian poverty in the film (yes, poverty knows no nationality, but Romanian poverty, as our festival winners prove from film to film, is particularly poor).
Also, without knowing the year of release, one can easily mistake what is happening on the screen for the exercises of some underground critical realists from the countries of the Warsaw Pact, who were given a lecture about Bresson in the early 1980s.
The film received the Grand Prix of the Jury at the Berlin International Film Festival.
The script is based on a play by Andrea Valerian, whose work is in high demand among directors of the Romanian "new wave".
Operator Marius Panduru often works with Corneliu Porumbay.
All of the above is true for Florin Serban's debut work, and - understand us correctly - is not at all pejorative, but rather recommendatory: the Romanian "new wave" is in a blissful stage of development, where the representatives' faith in the methods
Her work has not yet been shaken.
And this is the moment to seize: it is only thanks to this faith that one can endure the one and a half hour spectacle of the Romanian juvenile detention facility and surrender to the charisma of the talented Pistéranean (whose story, despite the chasm separating the two cultures, one can easily embrace).
convert it into an exploitation film a la 70s, with a cowboy who decides to take a walk from the jail, where he will soon be released, to the nearest saloon).
IN ROLES: Georg Pistaueran, Adina Condescu, Mihai Constantin, Clara Voda, Marian Bratu
SYNOPSIS: After serving his four-year sentence, 18-year-old convict Silvio (Pistoreanu) is about to be released, but suddenly finds out that his mother wants to take his younger brother with her to Italy.
From that point on, the young man's behavior becomes inappropriate.
The flirtation with social worker Anna further spurs the guy to desperate acts, the meaning of which is exhausted by the title of the film.
What a load of rubbish!
If you want to watch, then watch.
A decent debut, inspiring a faint hope that Romanian art house will one day develop into a decent genre
A cartoon about the joys of villainy and family life
The directorial debut of a man named Grob (Sop) and his co-author Reno was made under the auspices of producer Christopher Meledandri, the grey cardinal of American animation, responsible, in particular, for all the Ice Age, Horton, and Robots films.
"Sicko" is probably the best work of his team: the picture is beautifully drawn (by the way, it makes sense to watch it in 3D), especially if you like it when different objects keep jumping out of the screen and into the theater), it is well written, and, most importantly, there is not a single fart joke here, because of which you had to blushingly shrink into your seat and cover your child's ears on "Ice Age".
It is clear that the reason for the change in direction was not the authors' sense of proportion, but the glaring asexuality of the main character, which in turn was dictated by the unwillingness to touch on the topic of pedophilia in any way.
The “adult” part here, in addition to the main conflict of single fatherhood, is characterized by rather harsh black humor (which, one would like to think, we owe to director Coffin).
Overall, this is a very likable movie - so much so that at some point it even becomes too perfect and too right.
You can feel the hard work of a well-coordinated team of marketers, who thought through every little detail so that the film would appeal to all categories of citizens.
Not that we wanted to see the childhood cartoon heroes eaten by cannibals or destroyed by an atomic explosion
SYNOPSIS: The snouty villain Gru, whose childhood dreams of space exploration have over the years transformed into the idea of stealing the moon, in order to carry out his grand plan and eliminate a young competitor, is forced to seek the help of children.
In some advanced orphanage, he adopts three female orphans - Margo in glasses, Edith in a hat, and Agnes, who is as cute as a kitten from Shrek.
As is usually the case, children immediately transform the plans of adults.
The main character is based on Christopher Melandrdi - both of them are bald, big-nosed, and have a penchant for black humor.
In the original, the main characters were voiced by Steve Carell and Jason Segel.
In the final, Gru dances Travolta's part
A van pulls up to an abandoned trailer in the middle of a hypothetical desert, and three pairs of the finest breasts step out.
That's right.
The carriers of this gift themselves are not so significant.
The camera confidently focuses on this part of the body.
For fans, we have some good news to share right away — the entire film is in the same vein.
Rick Jacobson understands the most important things about women's beauty, and he cast the film in such a way that what happens on screen is of secondary importance.
And a lot of fun things happen.
The "broker", "killer", and "striptease artist" dig in the sand, get doused with water (don't ask why), carry around some kind of gruel, and periodically fight with a fierce intensity.
The creators believe that a pregnant sow with generous curves, smeared in mud, with a broken nose and gleaming white teeth is cool.
"Stervoznye shchitki" are primarily aimed at classic sexploitation films.
Rick Jacobson filmed episodes of "Zena: Queen of the Warriors" and "The Amazing Adventures of Hercules".
A film with a similar spirit in Moscow cinemas is “A Stem for Jennifer”.
It's also cool when a bitchy beauty whips eggs at a thug, a beaten-up punk fights alongside a Japanese schoolgirl, a samurai sword and lesbian sex are thrown in; and the plot is developed through an endless number of flashbacks.
In general, for a cinematic fetishist, this is a real goldmine of pleasures.
It's clear, of course, that Jacobson and his gang were having a blast making this trash parody, but the task itself seems rather strange.
If it weren’t for the physical attributes of the actresses, it would have become boring by the middle.
It can be assumed that this game came to us from the adult night channel (Jacobson, by the way, often takes on serial episodes)
IN THE ROLES: Julia Voth, Erin Cummings, America Olivo, Michael Hurst, Ron Melendez
SYNOPSIS: Three dangerous beauties bring a mafia boss to the desert, who has diamonds worth a substantial sum hidden somewhere here.
After failing to achieve anything and shooting the unfortunate bandit, the babes start to bite, fight with each other and periodically with hoodlums who arrive from somewhere, as well as regularly kiss and hug.
As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that all three are not who they appeared to be at the beginning.
Apparently, according to the author, it's even more fun that way.
A product for a narrow circle of fans of terrible misogyny
Yes, with his latest film, "Doomsday," the disgruntled "Mad Max" for the poor, Marshall has made a serious misstep
The bloodthirsty and biting Peplum returns the director's shaken trust.
The new politically incorrect and gloomy magnum opus is not shy about its modest budget, obvious sources of inspiration, and the brutal B-movie aesthetic.
The film also features the hooligan bravado of the "Dog Warriors" and the animalistic brutality of "The Descent".
The “Marshall Plan” to clean up the “peplum” from the post-gladiatorial film trash, in general, worked.
In 2011, Kevin McDonald will present his interpretation of the history of the Ninth Legion.
His battle-scarred legionnaires (among others, the unexpectedly colorful David Morrissey and Liam Cunningham) are tough guys trying to reconcile their military duty with an overwhelming desire to survive.
Homicide and the juicy details of natural bodily functions in ancient times are depicted here with love and detail.
The scene of the annihilation of the Ninth Legion, which took a lot of budget money, is directly inspired by the opening sequence in the German forests from the now classic "Gladiator" by Sir Ridley Scott, but it's absolutely not pleasant to try to accuse Marshall of plagiarism: he works honestly and without complaints.
IN THE ROLES: Michael Fassbender, Olga Kurylenko, Dominic West, Liam Cunningham, David Morrissey
SYNOPSIS: The lands of modern Scotland, occupied by the Holy Roman Empire.
The remote outpost, where centurion Quintus Diaz (Fassbender) is stationed, is mercilessly overrun by a Pict scouting party.
The miraculously saved Diaz is forced to first join the infamous Ninth Legion, and then, with a group of other surviving Romans, try to escape from a group of Pictish fighters led by the sadistic Itaine (Kurilenko).
The subtle art-house actor has so far managed to win only small, sharply characterized roles in Hollywood, but it is very much to be hoped that after Centurion, things will change.
Peplum is a corrected and expanded edition.
Almost like "Gladiator", only more modest and harsher
The story continues with the schoolgirl Bella (Kristen Stewart) and her complicated relationship with two highly promising young men - the pale-faced vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and the werewolf-culture vulture Jacob (Taylor Lautner).
Pattinson's fans held their breath.
A large-scale film version of the cartoon series about a bald boy wizard, who is called upon to bring peace to four kingdoms.
The ruler of fire started a bloody war and subjugated his neighbors.
Young Aang can stop him only if he learns to control all the elements and becomes the Avatar.
The Cobb house (Leonardo DiCaprio) is able to steal other people's thoughts and works tirelessly in the field of industrial espionage.
As it penetrates the object's sleep, it forces the sleeping brain to work according to its own rules.
But this time he will have to do the opposite – leave in one head what wasn’t there.
A picturesque lesson on managing illusory worlds from Christopher Nolan.
An experienced wizard (Nicholas Cage) finds a young assistant in the hopes of defeating the evil magician (Alfred Molina) together.
With the help of destructive spells, they will set up a dungeon with dragons and explosions in the middle of Manhattan.
The hairless, like a billiard ball, has hatched a plan to take over the world, and now the super-agent dogs are forced to join forces with their meowing antagonists.
The second series of the fluffy family comedy.
A group of hardened thugs, led by the seemingly fragile Royce (Adrien Brody), mysteriously find themselves on another planet, where they are hunted by stylish, fanged aliens.
The return of the cult character of the 80s to the big screen.
Note George Clooney, who teamed up with rock photographer-turned-filmmaker Anton Corbijn ("Control") for a very curious existential exploration of the psychology of an aging hitman hiding from people in a small Italian town and only belatedly coming to grips with human nature.
"The visionary artist of Corbijn's scale and the magnificent George Clooney are a cinematic union sealed in heaven," boasts the studio press release.
Moreover, this project is another confirmation of Clooney’s longest love affair in life – with Italy: the filming took place in the picturesque town of Castel del Monte in Abruzzo.
Taking Martin Bout's novel "A Very Private Gentleman" as a basis, Rowan Joffe made some adjustments to his script: the English narrator was replaced by an American in the title, and the protagonist, who was an illegal arms dealer, was transformed into a simple killer.
Otherwise, the story is close to the original: while the hitman Jack tries to deal with his last job and finally give up his lucrative profession, his icy heart melts under the charm of a local priest (Paolo Bonacelli) and a street prostitute (Tekla Ruten) whom the character played by Clooney falls in love with instantly.
"Jack tempts fate," says the official synopsis.
A dangerous messenger of darkness is getting closer and closer to him, and the mysterious lady who hires him may very well not be who she claims to be."
Judging by the trailer, Corbijn's visual experiments, seasoned with Clooney's grizzled hair (the film is like a long music video 02), have reached a qualitatively new level.
Daniel Radcliffe will play the lead role in the film adaptation of Remarque's "All Quiet on the Western Front"
Or maybe I could shoot you with a gun!?
This season, Johnny Depp could be seen in two places at once.
Firstly, in Venice, on the set of the thriller “The Tourist” by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck (“The Lives of Others”).
There, he plays a heroin-addicted tourist in love with Angelina Jolie's character.
Secondly, in Puerto Rico, at the “Rum Diary” site, an adaptation of the debut novel by the legendary Hunter S. Thompson.
The director and screenwriter of the project is Bruce Robinson (“Withnail and I”), whose last directorial work was the thriller “Jennifer 8” in 1992.
Looking at the work of the poster artists of domestic prison dramas, one might not even doubt what inspired them.
But you can't approach the issue of implementing the idea literally!
However, at least it’s good that the heroine of the Russian film, even though she’s a foreigner, is not completely bald.
Director Danny Boyle mainly specializes in projects with Adam Sandler.
They have already completed four joint projects: "The Gilmore Girls", "Big Daddy", "Chuck and Larry: The Wedding", and "Don't Mess with Zohan!".
In July, the fifth comedy will be released — "Classmates" — and the sixth is currently in production — "The Hypocrite Wife" with Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman.
The schedule also includes the seventh film - the romantic comedy "Jack and Jill", where Sandler will have to play both Jack and his twin sister Jill.
Matthew Vaughn, who was memorable to viewers this year with the spectacular action movie Kingsman, will be in charge of rebooting the X-Men.
In the film "X-Men: First Class," the director first called James McAvoy, giving him the role of a young Professor X.
Rosamund Pike will play the telepathic mutant Emma Frost, nicknamed the White Queen, Amber Heard will transform into the blue-skinned Mystique, and Michael Fassbender will presumably become Magneto.
While the filming of the new series of the Bond franchise is delayed, its new director Sam Mendes has no time to be bored.
His list of projects includes the musical "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" and the screen adaptation of Iain McEwan's novel "On the Beach".
The author adapts the script himself.
Carey Mulligan has been offered the lead female role.
Gary Oldman is considering the role of the practical Major George Smiley, the main character in a series of novels by John Le Carre, in the screen adaptation of the thriller "The Spy Who Came in from the Cold".
In the first adaptation of this work in 1979, Alec Guinness played the lead role.
The new version will be directed by Danish director Thomas Alfredson, creator of the horror film "Let Me In".
Tom Tykwer is adapting David Mitchell's fantasy bestseller "Cloud Atlas".
According to the director, it is not an easy task (there are six parallel storylines in the novel), but it is an extremely interesting job.
He has already received offers from Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, James McAvoy, Ian McKellen, and Natalie Portman.
Filming of the international action movie by Maksim Korostyshevsky is underway in Crimea under the working title "Soldiers of Fortune".
It is dedicated to millionaires who went to a real war in search of adrenaline with their money.
Christian Slater, Sean Bean, Ving Rhames, Dominic Monaghan, Oksana Korostyshevskaya, and others are starring in the film.
The film is scheduled for release in early 2011.
Sam Rockwell will star in the comedy "Baby Jesus" alongside English pop star Pixie Lott
Megan Fox was fired from Transformers 3
As Ragottipe Film Company assures us, the dismissal is “not connected with that interview in which Fox compared Michael Bay to Hitler”.
Nonetheless, the main character and new love interest of Shia LaBeouf's character is likely to be played by English model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.
The girl has no experience in film, so she will have to take accelerated acting courses.
This fact should not scare the discerning viewer - there are many examples in the history of cinema of successful retraining of models into actresses.
Charlize Theron ("Monster"), Angelina Jolie ("Interrupted Life"), Jessica Lang ("Blue Sky", "Tutsi"), Kim Basinger ("Secrets of Los Angeles"), Jennifer Connelly ("Mind Games"), Gina Davis ("Random Tourist") and Halle Berry ("Monsters Ball"), who was the first runner-up in the Miss USA pageant in 1986, started out as models or appeared in fashion magazines, eventually receiving a well-deserved Oscar.
They excelled in acting (also the beauties Milla Jovovich, Cameron Diaz, Monica Bellucci, and, most pleasantly, our compatriot Olga Kurilenko.
High honors are clearly within their reach.
In short, Rose has someone to take as an example.
Valeria Gai Germankina, who received a Special Mention from the Cannes jury in 2008 for the film "Everyone Will Die, and I Will Remain" and directed the scandalous TV series "School", was appointed creative director at the MT television channel.
The channel's management believes that Valeriya will be able to bring about the desired and necessary changes.
In particular, they are already planning to shoot their own series (about teenagers or vampires).
Germanica also began casting new hosts.
The comedy "Kolotilov" by director Leo Gabriadze and producer Timur Bekmambetov unexpectedly turned into "Vykrutasy".
The main theme of the film remains the same – provincial Russian language teacher Slava Kolotilov (Konstantin Khabensky) is rushing to Moscow to meet his fiancée, but gets delayed to coach a team of street kids playing football.
The second storyline of the film has taken on a new development.
Instead of actress Elena Plaskina, the role of the capital's bride Nadya will be played by Milla Jovovich.
A third character will appear as an additional twist: Nadya's former fiancé Danya (Ivan Urgant).
Thus, in addition to the question of whether the courtyard team will win the football championship, the dilemma arises of who will get Mila Jovovich.
Due to the constant delays in filming "The Hobbit" and the presence of a multitude of side projects, Guillermo del Toro declined the position of director.
The studios are trying to convince producer Peter Jackson to take full control of the project, but he is only willing to take this step if it is absolutely necessary.
David Yates, who finished filming the Harry Potter saga, and Neil Blomkamp, whose film District 9, produced by Jackson, was nominated for an Oscar, are mentioned as possible successors.
The official name of the new director will be announced at the next SOTS-SOP convention at the end of July.
Angelina Jolie will play Cleopatra
Overwhelmed by the rigid schedule, critics and filmmakers rushed around the Sochi Winter Theatre, where screenings with master classes were held, and the "Pearl" hotel, where press conferences and round tables were held in a continuous stream, barely having time to dive into the Black Sea.
The heroes of the competition films behaved in a similar way - in almost every film, someone ran away somewhere: the bewildered Asians from Yusup Razyakov's "Gastarbeiter" and Dmitry Mamulia's "Drug Other Sky" searched for a missing grandson and wife, a fugitive bandit from Yuri Bykov's "Live"
The same cops were happily waving their fingers at the hero of Klim Shipenko's detective novel "Who Am I?" — which, however, was remembered by the public more for the presence of the totally naked Jeanne Friske in the frame.
Heroes of domestic show business and a couple of competition films appeared - in the film "Elephant", Sergey Shnurov played a long-distance truck driver transporting a circus animal to be slaughtered, and Evgeny Grishkovetsky mused on his favorite topics - female betrayal, male loneliness, the healing power of alcohol - in the two-person film "Satisfaction", where business partners challenged each other to an alcohol duel over a woman.
However, business events at the "Kinotavr" festival also had a noticeable show aspect — there was not a single one that was boring.
At a round table dedicated to the fate of Russian art house, the chairman of the fund for supporting domestic cinema, Sergei Tolstikov, set up a verbal battle with critics: “Do you even read the articles in the press that I read?” he sternly asked the assembled group.
“I write them”, the president of ERVEZS! Andrei Plakhov responded, looking confused.
The scandals didn’t end there: closer to the end of the festival, the film Aleksey Fedorchenko’s “Ovsyanki” was suddenly removed from the competition program – it will go to Venice: the selection committee of Mostra decided that an additional Russian screening would be a hindrance to them.
Previously, Kinosavr didn't interfere with the giants - in Sochi, films from major festivals were shown on numerous occasions: this time, for example, Sergei Loznitsa's film My Happy Life was in the competition, which in the spring competed with Mikhalkov and Virasatkan on the Cote d'Azur.
At the Kinoshock festival, Nikita Sergeyevich watched a film by a former Cannes competitor and said that he liked it.
On the other hand, Karen Shakhnazarov, the chair of the jury, didn’t like Loznitsa’s film at all — but under pressure from his colleagues, he was forced to give her the award for directing.
The award for best debut — "Missing" — was received by the daughter
A terrifying cinematic encyclopedia of Russian life: naive, humane, and rational heroes are beaten, robbed, and provoked to commit monstrous acts without any apparent purpose.
A precisely executed, cleansing thought experiment, directed by a misanthrope with a mathematical education, who calls for only one thing - start thinking.
A debutant with a philosophical education, Mamulia calls the films quotes from Mammadashvili, avoids any events in the script, and claims that the joy of the viewer lies in the work of understanding his little-known meditative films.
The most difficult Kinotavr film has already been selected for the Karlovy Vary competition — the directorial star has been born.
The impeccably dressed and groomed programmer Leonid reacts to the world with restrained disgust, hiding in the den of neat bachelor living.
But a cast-iron babushka falls on his head, and an unjust hand of the punitive authorities falls on his head, and he begins a senseless run through Kafkaesque spaces and situations.
“Sometimes it’s useful to work not only with debutants”, the producer Sabina Yeremeyeva triumphantly declared from the stage, as she collected the prize.
Critics thought otherwise: in their opinion, Sabine simply managed to pull out the "inner debutant" from the grandee of domestic art-house cinema.
And this is symptomatic - these days in our cinema, bison are moving with the youth.
Not at all the other way around.
Documentary films are made in such a way that they knock your head off more effectively than similar works of art.
The author is interested in a screwdriver examining an electric meter, and a piece of unsalted butter drifting on a cast-iron pan—all of this turns the story of an unemployed miner, his rare-breed lover, and her criminal brother into a real oil painting.
Short film competition winner Nikolai Sokolov applies the black-and-white style of the French New Wave to the world of residential areas.
Let the Jarovian assembly passages in the story about two schoolboys, one of whom dreams of making a bomb and the other of playing Bach backwards, seem strange, but for the rare attempt to poetize the surrounding reality — thank you.
"Three times a year - on the eve of Victory Day, Russia Day, and City Day - about ten aircraft of the An-12, Il-18, An-32, and An-24 types, equipped with meteorological equipment and technical means of influencing clouds during the work, and loaded with special environmentally friendly chemicals - liquid nitrogen, granulated carbon dioxide (dry ice), meteorological fuse with iodine silver, and powdered reagents - are launched into the sky.
The process works as follows: planes at a distance of 50-100 kilometers from Moscow (depending on the length and power of the rain front) “break up” the clouds coming towards the city with these reagents. The particles of the substances condense moisture around themselves.
As a result, precipitation falls earlier than planned, and precisely in the place where the cloud was affected."
For the past ten years, work has been underway on a remake of a science fiction film, in which Michael York played the lead role.
Recently, Carl Rinsch was appointed as the director (he already has a remake of "Creatures from the Black Lagoon" on his schedule), who made a name for himself with his commercials.
Previously, the project was associated with the names of Bryan Singer (X-Men), James McTeigue (V for Vendetta) and Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy).
According to the plot, the hero, who has turned thirty, is forced to flee from the death sentence, since the society of the future executes all citizens upon reaching that age.
Robert Rodriguez has acquired the rights to an 80s rotoscoped fantasy film and plans to turn it into a major motion picture.
The original was the result of the joint creative efforts of director Ralph Bakshi (the film "The Lord of the Rings", 1976) and fantasy artist Frank Frazetta.
The theme of the cartoon was swords, magic, and a large number of drawn cucumbers.
In it, warrior Larn saves Princess Tiga and the entire nation from the evil ice ruler Necron.
Rodriguez promises to pay close attention to the creation of non-humans and barbarians on pterodactyls.
George A. Romero will send his zombies on vacation for the time being, as he himself is planning to work on a remake of Dario Argento's classic giallo film.
The heroes will be brought back to the big screen by none other than Michael Bay, the master of action, explosions, and horror remakes.
The director of the remake will be Damin Chen, who will also adapt the script.
Arquette and Romero had already collaborated on "Night of the Living Dead" and together filmed "Two Evil Eyes" in 1990.
This time Dario is not directly involved in the project, but his brother Claudio is producing the film and writing the screenplay.
Jennifer Garner and Nick Nolte will join Russell Brand and Helen Mirren in the remake of the comedy "Arthur"
"I wanted to bring more strength to the female character to reflect the situation in China," says Chen.
— Chinese women nowadays run major businesses and win Olympic gold.
Gong Li embodies this strength."
For the second time in a row, you play an imaginary character.
Is it a coincidence?
A pattern.
I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I am presenting two films here (at the Kinoshock festival and the Sochi film market - EMRE).
And in both of them, I play a woman of dreams.
But... that’s how the director saw me, that’s how he presented me, and many people probably think that’s how I am in real life.
Dream girl.
Your co-star Alexander Yatsko is nothing like his character.
How did you find common ground? What is he like on the job?
He is absolutely not what he seems at first glance.
At first I saw him and thought, 'Yeah... it's not just me that has to do this.'
Probably, without human contact, sincere and genuine, we would not have succeeded.
And this contact happened literally a few minutes after we met.
We got on great, I'm not afraid to say so.
I told him all my fears, all my worries, that I was afraid it wouldn't work out, and I asked him for some advice and help, and he was happy to give me that advice and help.
We talked a lot...
I tried to do this because I was very afraid of losing this contact, of losing our mutual understanding.
That's why we held hands during the premiere and watched the whole movie together.
How did the filming in Sevastopol go?
Sevastopol is the first city I visited.
I have never had a vacation there, or gone there as a child.
This city has a special magic, a certain character, its own charm.
And it is a city that you want to return to.
He has his own provincial charm.
A place where no one is in a hurry and everyone always has time for everything.
It turns out that it was not difficult for you to play the part of being in love with this city.
In general, you are extremely natural on screen, which many people, to be honest, did not expect.
How do you work with roles?
Are emotional scenes easy for you to perform?
You know, I'm an amateur actor.
And I am, by nature, a very trusting person.
If I came and agreed to work with the director, then I am, in fact, entrusting myself to his hands and I want to be the test from which they will mold.
I am well aware that I am visible from the side, and I, again, ask for tips and talk with the director for a very long time, not me talking to him, but he conducts preliminary conversations with me and explains in the clearest and most precise way what he needs.
And then, with long, multi-hour rehearsals, we arrive at the organic quality you’re talking about.
And how did you work with the film director Klim Shipenko?
I was turned on by everyone, the cameraman, the director, the producer, Sasha Yatsenko.
Because I love working with crazy people!
I saw the same thing when I worked with Timur Bekmambetov.
He was ready to go without sleep or food - and this was exactly the situation here.
Not sleeping, not eating for days on end - and still, even if it's thunder or hail.
And if something didn't work out, it was a disaster, and you had to do something urgently to make it work.
In this atmosphere of madness, it's very easy to work.
And I think that when people are so far gone into the painful fanaticism of what they are doing, it cannot fail, because too much energy is being expended.
What scenarios are you rejecting?
What are the criteria for selecting the material you will be working with?
I don’t want nonsense, stupid dialogue, films that say nothing, that don’t bring anything.
I don’t want to work just to appear on the screen once again.
Do you have any proposals, projects that you are going to work on in the near future?
There are currently no specific proposals or plans.
I am not the kind of person who draws up schedules.
The script came along, I was interested in it, and today this premiere happened.

A report from the set of Tony Scott's new thriller, in which Denzel Washington saves the world again
VOICE BOX
While we are working on the November issue, film festivals are almost continuously taking place in Moscow: American cinema - AmFest, 2togo, and 2-t-1 will begin soon, followed by a festival of British cinema.
And here's what's interesting: half of my acquaintances are constantly discussing who needs to be boycotted and who needs to be supported, for some — well, pardon me — very vague reasons.
Moreover, when one of these festivals is solemnly closed with a terrifying Chu4 project without English subtitles, no one seems to notice anything.
It’s the last thing you want to do, but if you buy a ticket with your money and then sit in the theater watching giant pixels and horizontal figures of actors, then that’s what you’ll get.
Meanwhile, we have no pixels: "Tron: Legacy" (a sequel to the classic film about virtual reality), "Let Me In. Saga" (an American remake of a beautiful Swedish film), "Unstoppable" (another approach by Tony Scott to the topic of trains) and a wildly detailed account of how the films about Conan, the barbarian, destroyer, and governor were created.

The multi-part fairy tale about the cute wizard with glasses is coming to an end.
And even if fans of the series have long since read the book and know how it will all end, and those who know nothing about the word "Expelliarmus" will stay at home, Harry's title as the main November blockbuster is practically reserved.
The studios, by the way, aren’t made up of fools: in order to stretch out the audience’s enjoyment and squeeze the maximum out of the franchise, they decided to split the seventh film into two parts.
So the sentimental farewell to the magical world of Hogwarts will be stretched out until next summer.
SOCIAL NETWORK
The history of the creation of the Facebook network
David Fincher’s new film is, first and foremost, a story about a paradox.
The film tells the story of the invention of Facebook, one of the pioneering tools in the field of the Internet, which united the entire world, estranged five friends, and made its creator, 26-year-old former Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, the youngest billionaire of recent decades.
Jesse Eisenberg in the lead role is as great as our conflicted genius, an emotionally isolated social outcast with an unpredictable set of motivations and attachments.
Zuckerberg is launching the site for a variety of reasons: partly because of his anger at the world, partly because of his interest in sports, and partly simply because IT'S "cool".
The very idea and its implementation may seem spontaneous and impulsive, but the actual course of events suggests a clear calculation and a well-thought-out business plan.
The strengths of The Social Network become apparent from the first frames, especially in the scene before the opening credits, where Zuckerberg talks in a bar with his ex-girlfriend Erica (Mara): the ringing, tough dialogues by screenwriter Aaron Sorkin gain strength here and do not soften until the very end.
The same goes for Fincher's directing: it was relatively restrained (except for the Winklevoss twins, who were played by actors who didn't look alike).
The face of one of them was superimposed on another using computer graphics.
Natalie Portman studied at Harvard at the same time as Zuckerberg.
Runna Mara has been cast in the lead role in Fincher's next film, "Girl with the Dragon Tattoo".
DIRECTOR David Fincher
IN THE ROLES: Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Rune Mara, Justin Timberlake, Armie Hammer, Joshua Pens
SYNOPSIS: The gloomy and introverted Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, having received a setback at home, takes on the ambitious task of creating a fundamentally new social network.
As Facebook's popularity grows, relationships with a few close friends begin to fray and eventually lead to lawsuits.
The color palette plays its part: warm, sometimes sunny, even in the dark it remains cozy, it maneuvers between two tangled chains of events and two separate legal battles.
Not much happens outside the stream of endless discussions in the film: not a single death or murder, and all of Zuckerberg's legal troubles are unlikely to fill even an additional paragraph for his meager page on Wikipedia.
What attracted 49-year-old Sorkin and 48-year-old Fincher to this story, which is not particularly rich in details?
After watching it, there is a persistent feeling that The Social Network is a portrait of our time, and that the omission in this case is an important artistic technique.
Just twenty years ago, Wall Street was doing more or less the same thing, only on a larger scale, with space egos and big deals.
Now that daily liquidity has become even higher, policy is no longer implemented at board meetings or in sandboxes.
Zuckerberg wants to be special, he dreams of becoming the center of attention.
Severin (Garfield) is hurt that his best friend has a new best friend (Timberlake) and now he has no one to play with.
Winklevosses (Hammer and Pence), meanwhile, are kicking up a fuss: who said that rich, beautiful, and athletic people can't also be smart?
(This line is particularly amusing to Fincher.)
If desired, a black comedy could have been made out of The Social Network.
Zuckerberg is obsessed with the idea of popularity and leadership, but what is more prevalent in his case - the positive or the negative?
And what social consequences will his invention bring?
Is he a crook?
Or a cunning manipulator?
Fincher and Sorkin will never close the book if there is even the slightest hint of something like that.
But even that won't be necessary: in their version of history, it's not important at all.
"What is it like to feel beautiful?" is asked in the song "Vabu Wotse A Vsp Map" by Tre Veanez, preceding the credits.
The hero doesn't know.
The film provides the answer.
Zuckerberg is a representative of a lost online generation that has a weak understanding of beauty and even less of feelings.
A character-driven drama with a taste of the internet age's high-profile trials
In the early 17th century, when Ivan Susanin lived, surnames did not really start to appear among people of humble origins.
They were referred to as "such-and-such, son of such-and-such".
That is, patronymics were in use - nicknames based on the father's name.
But sometimes, for example in the case of a father's remarriage, the matronymic - a nickname based on the mother's name - was used.
Susanna is just such a case: "Ivan, son of Susanna".
Serfs of small landowners really did manage without surnames for a long time — why would they need them, when you have 20 souls and everyone is always in plain sight.
But the owners of thousands of estates were forced to give their peasants surnames.
Thus, the serfs of Prince Andrei Cherkassky already had surnames in the early 18th century.
In the 19th century, even small landowners did not keep peasants on the land, but let them go to work for hire - let them earn a living through a craft and pay the master.
Such a peasant was entitled to a passport, in which the surname had to be entered.
Of the abolition of serfdom in Central Russia, 55% of serfs were released into servitude.
This means that they already had surnames.
Capital city criminal investigators flew in to investigate the explosion in Novosibirsk
Criminal investigators from the central office and staff from the forensic center arrived in Novosibirsk to help with the investigation into the gas explosion in the house at Lineynaya Street, 39, reports NGS.
According to the investigation, the accused, Irina Urbach and Evgeny Kavun, posing as employees of the fictitious organization “Interregional Gas”, inspected and repaired gas equipment.
They used low-quality parts, worked carelessly, and, on the contrary, overcharged for their services, the agency reports, citing an informed source.
The day before the tragedy at the Linear building, a man and a woman visited three apartments in house number 39, where they were changing the hoses of the stoves.
For example, in one of the apartments, they installed a hose for water instead of a gas one.
Kavun however denies this.
According to him, this is impossible, everything was certified.
As a result of their actions, a gas-air mixture leaked and exploded in one of the apartments.
Two stairwells collapsed - one completely, the other partially.
This led to a significant collapse of the building, which resulted in the deaths of 13 people.
Earlier, the suspects in the case of the explosion of a house in Novosibirsk were arrested.
The scammers themselves came from Omsk.
Petersburg managed to avoid a tidal flood
Arguments of the Week.
Saint Petersburg → Society

Experts were able to prevent the flooding by closing the dam a day earlier.
On Friday, the threat of flooding in Saint Petersburg increased dramatically due to the bad weather in the city.
The sea surge flood was prevented thanks to the timely closure of the dam.
The potential flood could have been the 32nd, reports the St. Petersburg publication Nevada.Tudey.
The water level reached 184 centimeters, but thanks to the closure of the locks in the Gulf of Finland, the water level remained at 168 centimeters, which is only seven centimeters above the lower threshold of the dangerous flood level (from 161 to 210 centimeters).
The weather conditions were complicated by gusty winds, the speed of which at times reached 20-25 meters per second.
Now the dam has been reopened, the water level has dropped, and ships can once again navigate the Gulf of Finland.
It should be noted that ten meteorological stations are monitoring the water level situation on the eastern side of the Gulf of Finland.
This allows flooding to be prevented, which may follow the strengthening of the wind.
In Turkey, 8 people have been arrested in a case about construction defects in collapsed buildings
Eight people have been arrested in the Turkish province of Şanlıurfa in connection with construction defects found in buildings that collapsed as a result of an earthquake.
As reported by Armenpress, Habertürk reports on this.
As a result of the earthquake that occurred in Turkey on February 6, more than 20 thousand people died.
The number of wounded exceeds 80 thousand.
It is noted that the earthquake is the strongest one since 1939.
Hundreds of aftershocks followed the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.7, which were felt not only in 10 provinces of Turkey, but also in neighboring Syria.
Pashinyan sent congratulatory messages to the Supreme Leader of Iran and the country's president
Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan sent congratulatory messages to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei, and to the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ebrahim Raisi, on the occasion of the 44th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.
Armenpress reported this to the Department of Information and Public Relations of the Office of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia.
The message to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution of Iran, Seyed Ali Khamenei reads:
"Your Eminence,
I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you on the 44th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution.
Armenian-Iranian warm and friendly relations with centuries-old roots, a rich history, and traditions are of special importance to our two countries.
More than three decades have passed since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Republic of Armenia and the Islamic Republic of Iran, and we are witnessing a steady and stable bilateral cooperation.
I am confident that the Armenian-Iranian friendship, forged in an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust, will achieve even greater successes for the benefit of the peoples of Armenia and Iran in the future.
I take this opportunity to wish you good health and many years of life".
The congratulatory message sent to Ebrahim Raisi, in particular, says: "Your Excellency, accept our heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to you and the friendly people of Iran on the occasion of the 44th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution.
Founded on centuries-old history and mutual respect, the unbreakable Armenian-Iranian relations are of special importance to the Republic of Armenia.
I am confident that as a result of our joint efforts, we will be able to take interstate cooperation to a new level, the multisectoral agenda of which will be expanded even further for the benefit of the welfare of our two friendly peoples and the security of our countries.
Emphasizing the importance of our views on establishing and strengthening regional peace and stability, I reiterate the official invitation extended to you during my visit to Tehran last year to visit Armenia.
I would like to take this opportunity to wish you new achievements, and a stable peace for the friendly people of Iran."

Caption to the video: WW2 bomb explosion in Great Yarmouth is caught on camera
In England, in the port city of Great Yarmouth, a World War II aerial bomb exploded on Friday, which sappers were trying to defuse.
A powerful explosion was heard for dozens of kilometers, but there were no casualties.
Norfolk County Police announced that, although the explosion was unplanned, no one among the military personnel involved in defusing the bomb was injured.
"The device detonated shortly after work began to neutralize it.
Fortunately, the entire crew is safe.
The agencies have begun assessing the damage," Norfolk Police Chief Nick Davison told reporters.
Locals write on social media that the explosion shook houses 24 km away.

Caption to the photo: The explosion happened despite the plans of the sappers, but there were no fatalities or injuries
A 250-kilogram bomb was found during construction work on the bank of the River Yar, at the mouth of which, on the North Sea coast, Great Yarmouth stands.
Before attempting to disarm the bomb, the sappers built a protective sand wall around it, and a cordon, which did not allow outsiders to enter, was set up at a distance of 200 meters.
The explosive experts initially, on Thursday, planned to use a robot to cut the detonator off the bomb, but the attempt failed, and then they decided, as local press writes, to use the "slow burning" technique for the explosives.
The explosion occurred during this burning process.
During World War II, the Nazis dropped hundreds of thousands of bombs on Britain.
During the eight-month intensive bombing campaign from autumn 1940 to spring 1941, known as "Blitz", 450,000 bombs were dropped on Britain.
Among Belarusian researchers, women make up almost 40%
In Belarus, the number of women among researchers is 38.9%, reported Belta, the scientific associate of the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences, Alesia Solovei.
The share of women among candidates of science and doctors of science is also growing: among candidates of science, women make up 41.1%, among doctors of science, 21%.
In all fields of science, except for technical ones, the percentage of women exceeded 50%.
The most feminized area of scientific knowledge is medical science, in which the proportion of women is 64.4%.
Only in technical sciences are men predominant, women make up 26.7%.
In the National Academy of Sciences, the share of women among researchers is 49.1% - this is higher than the national average by 10.2%.
Among candidates of science, the proportion of women is 46%, among doctors of science - 20%.
Among the faculty at institutions of higher education, more than half are women (57%).
Among the vice-rectors for scientific, educational, and educational work, every third is a woman (31.8%), among deans - 38.7%, deputy deans - 44.6%, heads of departments - 42.5%.
The majority of women are among senior professors and lecturers - over 60%.
There is a high proportion of women among associate professors on the faculties (55.2%).
According to a Republican public opinion survey conducted by the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences last year, the majority of Belarusians do not support gender stereotypes about women's opportunities in science.
63.5% (56.5% of men and 69% of women) do not agree to some extent with the gender stereotype that "science is a male domain".
More than half of the country's residents do not hold the opinion that a woman is less competent as a scientist - 66.1% (59% men and 71.6% women).
“The transformation of gendered ideas about women’s research competence in the mass consciousness contributes to attracting young women to science, developing their creative potential, and forming a successful role model for a female scientist, including through the transfer of experience and the mentorship institution”, noted Alesia Solovei.
February 11 is annually celebrated as the International Day of Women and Girls in Science.
The holiday was established to introduce women and girls to the field of science, to encourage women to pursue scientific careers, and to recognize women's achievements in science.
According to UNESCO, women make up 30% of the total number of researchers in the world.
The likelihood of a further increase in the key rate is higher than its decrease
This statement was made by the Chairperson of the Bank of Russia, Elvira Nabiullina, following the results of the meeting of its Board of Directors on February 10, which decided to keep this rate at 7.50%.
The head of the regulator, in particular, noted that important changes have occurred recently.
On the one hand, the conditions of foreign trade have noticeably worsened - the prices of Russian oil have decreased.
On the other hand, the economic situation is developing better than the October forecast.
The shift in the structure of demand continues: consumption remains restrained, private investment is slowing down, but government spending is increasing.
At the same time, overall inflationary risks have increased.
“Therefore, this year the likelihood of a rate hike exceeds the likelihood of a rate cut.
The appropriateness of changing the rate will be determined by the development of the situation," said E. Nabiullina.
In addition to the more pronounced impact of fiscal policy, she noted three risks.
Firstly, a rapid increase in consumption in the context of heightened inflationary expectations, in the event that the factors that restrain consumer activity weaken.
Secondly, there is a growing shortage of workers and a lag in the growth of labor productivity compared to the growth of wages.
And there are still risks of additional tightening of sanctions restrictions.
Speaking about the regulator's future decisions, the Chairperson of the Bank of Russia noted that, despite the previously noted strengthening of pro-inflationary factors, the inflation forecast for the current year remains at 5–7%.
According to her, this may require a higher trajectory for the key rate than was assumed in October.
In the updated forecast of the Central Bank for this and the next year, the ranges for the average key rate have been raised by half a percentage point, to 7.0-9.0% per annum in 2023 and 6.5-7.5% per annum in 2024.
“This does not rule out the possibility of a rate cut this year, but its likelihood and scale have decreased.
On the other hand, the likelihood has increased that some increase in the rate may be necessary in order for inflation to meet the 4% target in 2024”, the head of the Bank of Russia concluded.
The Bank of Russia has approved requirements for the procedure for creating special closed-end mutual investment funds (MIFs) consisting of blocked foreign securities.
The regulator informs that such securities will be removed from the composition of existing retail mutual funds.
This will allow the management of the remaining liquid assets to be launched and the resumption of operations with investment shares.
If more than 10% of the retail mutual fund consists of blocked securities, the management company must allocate them to a separate closed mutual fund by September 1, 2023.
Each shareholder will be issued shares of the new fund in an amount equal to the shares of the main fund.
A change in the status of the retail fund to closed is also possible.
For funds with less than 10% of blocked securities, the new requirements are not mandatory.
But the management company has the right to allocate the blocked assets into a separate closed mutual fund.
In addition, there is a requirement to inform shareholders about the consequences of withdrawing blocked securities from a special mutual fund.
In the future, in the event of the implementation of such securities, management companies are required to pay out at least 90% of the proceeds to the owners of investment units on a quarterly basis, according to a statement from the Bank of Russia.
In addition to summarizing the industry, experts also provided a forecast for the current year.
According to the Center for Analysis and Expertise of Promsvyazbank, in 2022, passenger traffic on air transport in Russia decreased by 6.3%, and passenger traffic decreased by 14.2%.
The volume of passenger traffic amounted to 95.2 million people, and passenger turnover was 228.0 billion passenger-kilometers.
International passenger traffic amounted to 17.2 million people, which is 26.7% lower than the previous year, and domestic traffic amounted to 78.0 million people (-10.9%).
PSB analysts note that the relative stability of the industry was influenced by government support programs.
In 2022, a program to stimulate domestic tourism was in effect, with 38.8 billion rubles allocated for it.
Tourists could receive a partial refund for tours with flights arranged by Rosturizm.
Several state support programs were also implemented to ensure the accessibility of air transportation, including subsidies for passenger transportation, the development of regional transportation, etc., with a total budget of more than 27.5 billion rubles.
In the second quarter of 2022, the government decided to allocate an additional 100 billion rubles to airlines and to recapitalize Aeroflot by 52.5 billion rubles.
“Despite the sanctions pressure on the Russian aviation industry, as a result of the development of domestic tourism and the opening of new international destinations, as well as the continuation of state subsidies to the industry (so far 25.3 billion rubles have been allocated) in 2023, passenger traffic is expected to increase by 6.4%, to 101.2 million people (domestic passenger traffic will amount to 91.1 million people), according to the forecast of Rosaviation, up to 103.0 million people”, the analysts of PSB share their forecasts.
A terrorist attack in Jerusalem, a 6-year-old child died
Two people, including a 6-year-old child, were victims of a terrorist attack in Jerusalem: a car crashed into a bus stop at high speed.
Another six people were injured.
The driver of the car was shot dead on the spot.
It was later revealed that the perpetrator was a 31-year-old Palestinian from East Jerusalem.
Law enforcement agencies classified his actions as a terrorist attack, the terrorist's relatives were detained, and the house was sealed off.
At the same time, according to Israeli media reports, the attacker had mental health problems and was only discharged from the hospital this week.
Austria is once again tightening border controls with Hungary following another influx of migrants in recent months.
Officials say many people are staying at the border in their cars waiting to cross over to the Austrian side.
Thus, it becomes a signal to the Austrian authorities that they have already gone through the asylum procedure in Hungary.
Based on the existing agreements, Austria believes that migrants are obliged to remain in the country where the request was submitted.
At the same time, the Austrian authorities consider it wrong to automatically send back to Hungary those who want to cross the border: many migrants fall victim to smugglers and find themselves between two border posts without the right to return to Hungary.
That is why, according to the police, stricter control is required.
The decision to step up checks by Vienna followed a pledge by European Union leaders to allocate more funds for cameras, drones and watchtowers to protect the bloc's borders.
According to the Frontex agency, last year the number of illegal migrants who arrived in the EU and applied for refugee status exceeded the figures for 2016 for the first time, reaching more than 330 thousand.
Cargo ship "Progress 83" successfully docked with the ISS
The automatic supply ship Progress 83 successfully docked with the International Space Station on Saturday at 3:45 GMT, completing a two-day orbital flight.
The rendezvous occurred at an altitude of 269 statute miles above the southern Pacific Ocean.
The live broadcast of the docking was conducted by the NASA Flight Control Center in Houston, Texas.
In Russia, the docking was controlled by specialists from the Flight Control Center.
From the ISS, the cargo ship was greeted by cosmonauts Sergei Prokopyev, Dmitry Petelin, and Anna Kikina.
The Progress MS-22 spacecraft delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS, including 720 kg of refueling fuel, 420 kg of water, and about 1,354 kg of dry cargo.
In addition, the ship delivered food for the Russian cosmonauts.
Progress 83 successfully launched from the Russian Baikonur cosmodrome on Thursday.
At the same time, Roscosmos reported a loss of pressure in the Progress MS-21, which was prepared for separation from the ISS and subsequent drowning on February 18.
As specified by the company’s press service, the ship’s transition hatch was immediately closed: the Progress MS-21 is isolated from the overall volume of the ISS.
The reasons for its depressurization are being investigated."
TsUP also reported that the ISS crew is not in any danger: "The temperature and pressure on board the station are normal.
There is no threat to the lives and health of the crew, they are in good health”.
"There have been more cases of birth tourism."
How pregnant Russian women got stuck in Argentina
The migration service of Argentina has begun to suspend and revoke the residency permits of Russians who received them through the birth of a child, but did not remain in the country.
Earlier, the republic's authorities denied entry to the country to several pregnant Russian women, who were suspected of having arrived for the purposes of "maternity tourism".
On February 11, they were still allowed into Argentina by court decision.
For more information, see the article on Gazeta.Ru.
The Migration Service of Argentina has begun to suspend and revoke the residence permits (RP) of Russians who obtained them through the birth of a child, but did not remain in the country.
The director of the service, Florencia Carignano, spoke about this to the C5N television channel.
"What we are doing is suspending the residence permits of those Russians who came to obtain a residence permit because their child is an Argentinian, but who spent more time outside (Argentina) than inside (the country)", she explained.
According to her, when the court considers the issue of Argentine citizenship for the Russian national, the migration service will submit data that the residence permit was suspended because this person “spent a month in Argentina and never came back”.
Carignano warned that Russians who received a residence permit after the birth of a child and left the country may have it revoked.
Against this backdrop, on February 9 it became known that three pregnant Russian women were "stuck" at the airport in Argentina due to a refusal of entry into the country.
According to Georgy Polin, head of the consular department of the Russian embassy in Argentina, the diplomatic mission believes that the incident is related to the fact that the authorities of the republic may have considered the information provided by the girls upon entry to be incomplete or false.
One of them arrived on February 7, and two more arrived in the evening of February 8, RIA Novosti reports.
The diplomat emphasized that more pregnant women arrived in Argentina, but these three in particular were issued a decree prohibiting them from entering the country.
“They were not allowed into the country in accordance with the migration law, where one of the grounds for not allowing someone into the country is providing incomplete, false, or distorted information”, Polin said.
On Saturday, February 11, the immigration service of Argentina, by court order, allowed pregnant Russian citizens into the country, reported lawyer Christian Rubilar.
“An hour ago, they were all allowed to enter Argentina”, TASS quotes him as saying.
Rubilar noted that the migration service changed its decision after the court ruling.
It is easier for a child's foreign parents born in Argentina to obtain a passport of the Republic.
It allows for short-term travel to 171 countries without a visa, including EU states, Great Britain, and Japan, notes RBK.
In early January 2023, The Guardian wrote about the "birth tourism boom" in Argentina among Russians.
According to Polina, between 2,000 and 2,500 Russian citizens moved to the republic in 2022.
Many of them, the diplomat noted, are Russian women who are going there to give birth.
“In 2023, this number could grow to 10 thousand”, he said.
In turn, Carignano previously stated that in 2022, about 10,500 Russian citizens arrived in Argentina, and in recent months, more than 5,800 pregnant women.
On February 9, it became known how the prices for rental housing in St. Petersburg had changed.
It has become 10% cheaper.
At the same time, it is known that across the country, rent has become 25% more expensive, reports Patrol Petersburg with reference to RBC.
The average monthly rent for an apartment in St. Petersburg at the beginning of 2023 was 27,000 rubles.
A one-room apartment cost 25,000 rubles per month, a studio apartment cost 22,000 rubles per month, and a two-room apartment cost 36,000 rubles per month.
Experts believe that this trend may change as early as spring, when many citizens who have been abroad return home.
The reasons for questioning the women in a foreign country have become known.
The Migration Service of Argentina did not let six pregnant Russian women into the country, since the purpose of their visit, which they had indicated, turned out to be false.
TASS reports this, citing the Todo Noticias television channel.
For five hours, pregnant women were asked questions about the purpose of their visit.
Most of them admitted that they had come to a foreign country to give birth.
In this regard, representatives of the country did not allow Russian women into Argentina.
As the publication specifies, the migration service has a procedure to follow if there are suspicions of "false" travelers.
For example, if it is clear that a woman is 33 weeks pregnant, she does not have a return ticket to Russia, and she cannot clearly explain where she is going to go on vacation, then suspicions immediately fall on her from the migration service.
Moreover, experts clarify that it is difficult to be a traveler "in such conditions".
The artist's decision to leave the theater was planned.
State Prize of the Russian Federation laureate Alexander Filippenkov stated that the decision of the Moscow City Council theater not to renew his contract was planned, and that everything was agreed upon in advance with management.
He spoke about this in an interview with the Interfax news agency.
In the productions in which he took part, the artists from the second cast were invited.
The People's Artist of the Russian Federation clarified that his contract expired in 2022.
All the details were long ago agreed upon with the theater's representatives.
Moreover, everyone knew that the star was not going to renew the contract.
Filippenkov noted that the authorities agreed and prepared all the necessary documents.
Thus, he assures that he “did not let anyone down”.
In addition, it was reported that the artist emigrated from Russia.
He flew to his heir in Latvia.
Filippenkov is going to a foreign country to undergo "long-term treatment".
As stated in the publication, at the moment the film actor works at the Moscow theater as a guest actor.
According to the publication, the artist played in the Moscow City Council in such productions as “Shakespeare’s Hamlet” and “The Taming of the Shrew”, “Uncle Vanya”, as well as “Three Sisters”.
On Friday, February 10, 340 thousand cubic meters of snow were removed from private sector areas in Kalininsky AO.
This information was shared by the city hall.
At the moment, there are more than four hundred streets in the Kalininsky district that are part of the private sector, from which snow must be removed by spring.
The roads will be cleaned in two stages.
The first will end on February 15th, and the second will run from March 1st to April 15th.
114 units of specialized equipment and 123 workers will take part in the cleanup.
Authorities reported that contractors are facing the problem of residents of houses shoveling snow onto the roadway.
Kirkorov won the lawsuit against the fisherman
In the lawsuit, the man claimed that the artist's construction was illegal, but he did not appear at the hearing.
The fisherman sued the musician Philip Kirkorov over an allegedly illegally installed pier at his dacha outside Moscow.
This is reported by "Fifth Channel".
However, the Saratov fisherman was unable to win the case.
The Onezhtovsky City Court reviewed the complaint against the singer. According to the lawyer, documents and design projects were presented in court that confirmed the legality of all the structures installed on the property of the celebrity.
As the head of the law firm, Alexander Dobrovinsky, specifies, the construction of the pier did not leave the plaintiff with any chance of going fishing.
The application for the performer was filed on January 11.
The celebrity lawyer jokingly said that, probably, the man planned to fish exclusively from the artist's home.
Ironically, Dobrovinsky clarified that he would ask Kirkorov to provide the plaintiff with his own balcony for fishing.
He emphasized that from that location it is possible to keep casting with a spinning rod.
A sleep specialist has named the reasons for sleep problems
Sleep specialist doctor Sofia Cherkasova spoke about foods and habits that interfere with healthy sleep.
As the specialist noted, sleep problems often arise due to products containing caffeine.
This primarily concerns tea, coffee, chocolate, and any desserts containing cocoa.
Their use before bed should be limited, since they not only interfere with falling asleep, but also make sleep "jumpy", which means that the body is not fully able to recover.
According to the doctor, it is best to stop consuming caffeine-containing products 6-8 hours before bedtime.
Otherwise, they contribute to a decrease in the threshold of excitability of the nervous system, and as a result, difficulties with falling asleep arise.
Alcohol also negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
The doctor clarifies that small doses of alcoholic beverages promote relaxation and do not affect sleep.
However, amounts exceeding 36 grams, converted to pure alcohol, lead to various sleep disorders, such as superficial sleep and frequent nighttime awakenings.
In addition, to prevent sleep problems, the somnologist recommends giving up spicy food and large portions.
Large amounts and spicy food contribute to an increase in internal body temperature, which negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
It is not only necessary to maintain an external temperature regime for healthy sleep: an air temperature of 18-20 degrees is optimal - but also the absence of elevated body temperature.
According to Cherkasova, it is not worth abusing heavy foods before bedtime, since it will not allow the body to fully recover and rest: it will be forced to expend energy on digestion.
The doctor also reminded that the absence of healthy sleep and accumulated sleep deprivation affect the quality of life and habitual activities, which is why it is extremely important to adhere to a sleep and rest schedule and allow the body to recover.
Bloomberg has named the name of Trump's competitor in the upcoming presidential election: World: Politics: INFOX.ru
According to the agency, the governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, will be the former president's main competitor in the upcoming election.
The Republican Desantis has not yet officially announced his intention to compete for the presidency, but Bloomberg sources report that he is already preparing for the primary elections.
According to the agency, Desantis' team is already selecting consultants to participate in the presidential election and conducting preliminary polls.
In confirmation of this, Bloomberg reports on a planned off-site meeting for Republican Party leaders and government officials at the end of February.
The agency reports that the team of the governor of Florida is seeking support among Republican colleagues from Iowa, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and other states. Bloomberg experts named Desantis the main potential competitor to Donald Trump.
Experts consider the current governor of Florida to be well-known enough that he does not need to start a campaign right now, and also note his ability to raise money.
Ron DeSantis was a supporter of Donald Trump's nomination for the presidency in 2017, and he may be a competitor to him in the upcoming presidential election in November 2024.
Donald Trump officially announced his intention to run for president "to make America great again"... during a speech to his supporters in Florida.
The current president, Joe Biden, despite assurances from his team that he intends to participate in the 60th presidential election, announced that he has not made a firm decision on this matter.
In France, hundreds of demonstrations will be held on Saturday against the pension reform
The fourth day of mass protests against the pension reform is being held by France's trade unions on Saturday.
Hundreds of demonstrations will take place across the country, French media reports.
After a slight decrease in the number of participants in protests on Tuesday compared to the first two "days of mobilization", the unions hope this time to bring more protesters onto the streets, taking into account those citizens who were unable to participate in the demonstrations on a weekday.
Law enforcement agencies are expecting between 600 thousand and 800 thousand protesters across the country, including 90 thousand to 120 thousand in Paris, according to media reports.
On February 7, 757 thousand people took part in protests against the pension reform, according to the French Ministry of the Interior.
The largest trade union association, the General Confederation of Labour (GCL), claimed that there were 2 million protesters.
According to VKT, 400 thousand demonstrators also took to the streets of Paris on Tuesday.
The police say that there were 57 thousand of them.
The day before the protests, on January 31, the number of protesters was estimated by the police at 1.27 million and 2.8 million according to the unions.
The next mass protests are planned for February 16.
As reported, on January 10, French Prime Minister Elizabeth Borne presented the government's draft pension reform project, which provides for an increase in the retirement age from 62 to 64 years.
It is expected that the established retirement age threshold will gradually be raised from 62 to 64 years old by three months per year, and this process will last until 2030.
The new regime will be applied to generations of French people born in September 1961 or later.
French President Emmanuel Macron declared during the 2022 election campaign his determination to carry out pension reform before the end of his second presidential term.
On February 6, the French National Assembly began consideration of the government's draft pension reform.

More than 180 accidents occurred in a single day in Astana: February 11, 2023, 14:10
ASTANA.KAZINFORM - The capital's police department is urging drivers to be extremely cautious on the roads, taking into account the impact of weather conditions, reduced visibility during precipitation, and changes in the grip of the road surface in icy conditions.
181 accidents were recorded over the past 24 hours.
This was reported by the Kazinform International News Agency with reference to the press service of the police department of the city of Astana.
Pedestrians should also be attentive on the road, since violations of the rules for crossing the road by pedestrians also often lead to serious consequences.
This year, there were 11 incidents of vehicles hitting pedestrians who crossed the road in violation of established requirements, and all 11 pedestrians were injured.
In total, 35 accidents have been recorded since the beginning of the year, in which 3 people died and 39 people were injured with various degrees of severity.

The depressurization of the Progress MS-21 occurred on the ISS: February 12, 2023, 00:12
TASS - KAZINFORM - Roscosmos reported the depressurization of the Progress MS-21, which was prepared for separation from the ISS, MIA Kazinform reports, citing TASS.
"The contour of the Progress MS-21 transport cargo ship, whose flooding is scheduled for February 18, has been depressurized, as confirmed by telemetry data received at the Mission Control Center," the Roscosmos press service reported.
As noted, at the moment it is isolated from the overall volume of the station.
The reasons for the incident are being investigated, and it did not affect the docking of the Progress MS-22 cargo ship or the ISS's further flight program.
The situation was commented on by Roscosmos Executive Director for Manned Space Programs Sergei Krikalev.
"A cargo ship that has been docked at the station for several months suffered a leak of heat transfer fluid from the thermoregulation system.
The situation is somewhat similar to what happened to our ship (“Soyuz MS-22” – TASS’s note) in mid-December”, he said, noting that the commission that analyzed the incident with “Soyuz” concluded that the leak was caused by a micrometeoroid.
Roscosmos will conduct an analysis to ensure that there are no problems with the next launches.
"We need to conduct a thorough analysis to make sure that this cause does not apply to similar designs in future launches.
This is the most important task that will now be before us”, he said.
According to the CEO, an analysis will have to be conducted in terms of the ship's preparation for launch, the materials that were used, and the technologies that were used in the assembly of the radiator.
The same analysis was conducted in the case of the damaged radiator of the Soyuz MS-22 spacecraft.
“The most important thing is to make sure that this is not some kind of systematic error”, Krikalev added.
The CEO clarified that a commission began work on Saturday to conduct an analysis of all possible causes.
“The ship was scheduled to be undocked and deorbited two days before the launch of the Soyuz spacecraft (Soyuz MS-23 – ed. TASS), so the crew’s actions, the crew’s work... This will not affect the program from this point of view”, Krikalev noted.
The Progress MS-21 cargo vehicle was launched from Baikonur on a Soyuz-2.1a carrier rocket on October 26.
Two days later, it docked with the Russian segment of the ISS's small research module, "Search".
The ship delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS.
NASA has named the location of the "Progress" depressurization
The depressurization of the Progress MS-21 cargo ship at the International Space Station (ISS) occurred in the temperature control system.
This was reported by a representative of the American Mission Control Center (MCC) during negotiations with the ISS crew, which was broadcast by NASA.
According to NASA, the coolant leak from Progress has now stopped.
NASA believes that all the refrigerant has completely leaked out.
“This morning we had a leak of refrigerant from the thermoregulation system into space, the leak of refrigerant has stopped”, the representative of the American TUSP (quoted by Interfax) stated.
Earlier, the Progress module was isolated due to a loss of pressure.
Roscosmos reported that the cosmonauts are not in any danger.
The Progress M-22 docked with the ISS today, February 11, and it will be deorbited on February 18, according to the plan.
John Kirby, coordinator of strategic communications at the US National Security Council, declined to announce a possible trip by US President Joe Biden to Ukraine.
He told reporters about this at a briefing, which was broadcast on the White House YouTube channel.
Kirby noted that he "has nothing to announce about additional points of the American leader's trip to Poland."
The day before, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre announced Biden's visit to Poland from February 20 to 22.
As stated by a representative of the administration, during the trip, the US President will discuss bilateral cooperation with the Polish leadership, as well as joint efforts to support Ukraine and strengthen NATO's deterrence capabilities.
Prior to this, Kirby reported that Biden would visit Ukraine when the time was right, but that now is not the time for official visits.
Fitness expert talks about winter outdoor workouts for weight loss
A fitness expert called walking in the winter an excellent way to lose weight without intense exercise
Fitness expert Anthony Young spoke about effective interval training outdoors for weight loss.
His words are quoted by the Eat This, Not That portal.
The specialist called active walks in winter an excellent way to lose weight without intense exercise, as well as to improve the condition of the cardiovascular system and psychological health.
“The first five to ten minutes should be at a normal pace to warm up the body and joints.
Then, for one minute, walk as fast as you can, without transitioning into running.
One minute at normal pace," explains Eng.
It is necessary to make three approaches.
The specialist then advises doing lunges or squats with weights for 15 seconds, followed by walking at a comfortable pace for another 45 seconds.
This sequence needs to be repeated five times. Then, Engh suggests alternating between an active step (two minutes) and a calm step (one minute) three more times.
The walk should be completed with a five-minute walk at a calm pace and a few stretching exercises.
In total, this workout will take 35 minutes in the fresh air.
Earlier, the master of sports in track and field, Maksim Babenkov-Kudryavtsev, in a comment to Lenta.ru, gave advice on choosing equipment for winter runs.
"Thermal underwear, moisture-wicking clothing, special light but warm headgear will be needed.
Running shoes in winter are different because they have denser materials, a higher platform, and a sole protector," the athlete said.
On February 17, a creative evening will be held at the TDL with the Orthodox writer, historian, screenwriter, and member of the Russian PEN.
Writers, screenwriters, and scholars will participate in the evening.
Also on the program: Zlatan Aleksandr (piano) - winner of all-Russian and international competitions, Akinfin Dmitry (violin) - winner of international competitions, artist of the orchestra of Vladimir Spivakov, the Choir Group of the Holy Trinity Sergius Lavra and the Moscow Theological Academy (MTA) - rector Hieromonk Nestor.
The start is at 6:30 PM.
The head of Serpukhov inspected the condition of residential buildings
Head of Serpukhov District Sergei Nikitenko conducted a working tour of the territories.
Together with representatives of management organizations, he inspected the condition of apartment buildings and residential homes.
The addresses from which the most appeals were received from residents were found to be under the strictest control.
- Many of the comments are quite justified and primarily concern the cleaning of stairwells and the maintenance of common areas.
Serpukhov residents themselves are not standing on the sidelines and are actively fighting the problem of vandalism, especially the widespread graffiti.
We will work on the issue taking into account the "Safe Region" cameras, said the head of the municipality, Sergei Nikitenko.
Attention was also drawn to the replacement of mailboxes, light bulbs, the installation of wiring in boxes, and the untimely removal of garbage from container areas.
As soon as possible, the management companies must solve all the tasks set before them.
The Deputy CEO of RZD proposed that the Governor of the Irkutsk region explore new sales markets
The Irkutsk region needs to continue to explore alternative sales markets, in addition to the Far East.
This includes the domestic market and the ports of the Western direction, including the Azov-Black Sea basin.
This proposal was made by RZD Deputy CEO Alexei Shilo at a meeting with Governor Igor Kobzev, the regional government reported on February 10, 2023.
- As last year's experience showed, even despite the geographical location of Irkutsk region, this decision can be extremely effective.
It is important that the logistics services of companies constantly interact with our “neighbors” (ports, operators, maritime transport) and find optimal pricing conditions for transporting their products according to new schemes, emphasized Alexei Shilo.
The governor noted the importance of stable product shipments. The Irkutsk region is one of the richest regions in Russia in terms of mineral resources and has significant reserves of hard coal and brown coal.
About 25 enterprises are engaged in coal mining in the region.
The instability of export shipments has a negative impact on the financial and economic activities of coal mining companies.
Igor Kobzev also emphasized that the Irkutsk region is an export-oriented region, so it is necessary to increase the size of monthly quotas for the transportation of timber and metal products produced in the region to a level that ensures the stable operation of such enterprises.
- Understanding the importance of the Irkutsk region as an industrial center, we, for our part, will try to do everything we can to provide support for transportation volumes.
If additional volumes of shipments to the domestic market appear, we are also ready to provide assistance in this direction, said Alexei Shilo.
Konstantin Zaitsev held a meeting with the active citizens of the villages of Granovshchina and Khomutovo
At the order of the head of the region, Igor Kobzev, the Chairman of the Government of the Priangarye region, Konstantin Zaitsev, worked in the villages of Granovshchina and Khomutovo in the Irkutsk region today.
In the village of Granovshchyna, the Chairman of the Government familiarized himself with the work of a new educational institution - the Granovshchyna School, which opened in September 2022.
The facility was built as part of the federal project "Modern School" of the national project "Education".
The following facilities are located in eight school blocks: classrooms, a dining hall, a food preparation area, an auditorium, two gyms, club rooms, a library, administrative offices, restrooms, public rest areas, and a medical facility.
2.408 billion rubles were allocated from the federal budget for construction, more than 512 million rubles from regional funds, and more than 72 million rubles from the municipal entity.
In addition, a regional subsidy was allocated for the purchase of equipment in the amount of 64.2 million rubles.
After the opening, in addition to the children from the village of Granovshchina, the children from the Urikovskaya school, which was undergoing repairs, also attended the school.
More than 100 teachers are involved in the classes, of which almost 90 are subject teachers.
In 2022, a bus was allocated to the school, purchased by the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation under a federal program.
Capital repairs to Homutovskaya Secondary General School No. 2 began in 2022.
Students in the lower grades were distributed to Homutovskaya School No. 1, while the older grades are studying in the second building of School No. 2.
According to the renovation plan, the roof, engineering systems, windows, and related elements will be replaced, the facade will be renovated, and the interior of the premises will be finished.
An important component of the renovation is the re-creation of a heating point with water heating, which was replaced with dry heat.
The cost of all the work is more than 80 million rubles.
Repairs are in the final stages, there are problems with connecting to the power grid – an increase in capacity is needed, work is being done with the power supply organization.
In addition, in Granovschina and in Khomutovo, Konstantin Zaitsev held a meeting with citizens, some of whom had their homes illegally connected to the electrical grid by developers.
It was decided that the network company would organize a personal reception next week to legally resolve these issues.
- Very often, the issue of stable power supply is the main condition when buying a house, because the population is increasingly using electricity for heating.
Therefore, sellers sometimes illegally connect homes to nearby networks, and this is already grounds for disconnection of electricity supply.
Therefore, network companies in those territories where active construction is underway should pay special attention to this issue, emphasized Konstantin Zaitsev.
Anatoly Prokopyev assessed the effectiveness of state support measures for small-scale farms in the UFO region
The head of the UOBO, Anatoly Prokopyev, visited three KFHs in the Ekhirit-Bulagatsky District today.
The head of the KFH in the village of Kapsal, Yulia Madayeva, received a grant for the development of her farm as a beginning farmer in 2014.
One of the main areas of the farm's activity is the production of livestock products.
The number of livestock is increasing every year, and gross production of meat and milk is growing.
Later, thanks to state support, it became possible in 2019 to participate and win a grant in the form of subsidies for the development of a family dairy livestock farm.
To date, the cattle population in the farm is around 150 head, 60 of which are cows.
In addition, they are engaged in growing cereal crops and sowing annual forage crops.
Thanks to the activities of KFH of Viktor Katanayev, the locality of Kharyashino in the village of Kulunkun has been reclassified as a settlement.
The farm is engaged in the breeding and fattening of dairy cattle.
In 2014, they received a grant to develop a family dairy cattle farm with 60 heads.
To date, the farm has a herd of 150 cattle.
Potatoes have also been grown here for many years.
The head of the KFH tries to create all the necessary conditions for the team to work and live.
Now there is an entire village on the estate.
Anatoly Prokopyev took personal control of the issue of building two km of road from the area of Kharyashino to Ust-Orda.
The main activities of the KFH of Stalina Mogzoeva in the village of Otonkhoi are the breeding of cattle and water buffalo.
In 2020, the farm participated in a competitive selection and received an AGROSTARTUP grant for the development of a meat-focused farm.
With these funds, a tractor trailer, two press pickers, and a mower were purchased.
The head of the farm increases the number of livestock each year and increases gross meat production.
In addition to this, the KFH grows annual forage crops on an area of 40 hectares.
In Stalin's plans, Mogzoeva was going to open a feeding area.
Following a visit to three farms, the head of the district noted that state support measures are effective, necessary, and essential.
- The government of Irkutsk region pays great attention to agriculture.
Therefore, state support should not only be maintained, but also increased and raised.
In turn, we must be the guarantor of food security.
Agricultural producers of the district are honoring this role, emphasized Anatoly Prokopyev.
The crossing on the Armenian-Turkish border was opened for the first time in decades to deliver humanitarian aid
The Margara-Aldzhan border crossing on the border between Turkey and Armenia was opened for the first time in three decades to deliver humanitarian aid to those affected by the earthquake.
Turkish and Armenian media are reporting on this.
The same crossing was used to deliver humanitarian aid from Turkey to Armenia after the devastating earthquake in 1988, notes the Turkish agency Anadolu.
On Saturday, Armenia sent five trucks with 100 tons of food, medicine, water, and other emergency aid packages to the city of Adıyaman in southern Turkey, said Serdar Çalış, Ankara's special representative for Armenian-Turkish negotiations.
He expressed his gratitude to the Vice Speaker of the Armenian Parliament, Ruben Rubinyan, and the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Armenia, Vahan Kostanyan.
"I will always remember the assistance provided by the people of Armenia to alleviate the suffering of our people in the earthquake-stricken region," Kılıç wrote on his Twitter page.
In turn, the press secretary of the Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Vahan Unanyan, reported that trucks with humanitarian aid crossed the border via the Margara bridge and are heading to the earthquake-stricken region.
As Public Radio of Armenia reports, the last time a vehicle crossed the Margahar Bridge was 30 years ago, in 1993.
Since then, the Armenian-Turkish land border has been closed.
The Turkish agency "Anadolu" cites other data and writes that the border point of Margara-Aldzhan was last used to deliver humanitarian aid to Armenia to address the consequences of the devastating earthquake of 1988.
At that time, aid collected through the Turkish Red Crescent was sent to the disaster zone in Armenia.
Earlier, Armenia sent 27 rescuers to Turkey and another 29 rescuers to the earthquake-stricken areas of Syria.
According to the latest reports, more than 25 thousand people have died in Turkey and Syria from the devastating earthquake that occurred on Monday.
On February 11, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan reported that 21,848 deaths have already been recorded in Turkey.
The Syrian side reported 3,553 deaths.
Relations between Turkey and Armenia are mainly clouded by the fact that Ankara refuses to recognize the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire, and also supported Baku during the First and Second Karabakh wars.
Recently, Yerevan and Ankara have made a number of attempts to normalize relations.
In 2021, Armenia and Turkey appointed special representatives who met several times in Vienna to discuss issues related to normalization.
In February 2022, commercial air traffic between Yerevan and Istanbul resumed after a two-year break.
In July 2022, Ankara and Yerevan agreed to open the land border for citizens of third countries as soon as possible.

Makachev received a prestigious award from UFC - RT in Russian
Russian mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter Islam Makhachev received a prestigious award from the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), becoming the winner of the "Submission of the Year" award for his early victory over Brazilian Charles Oliveira.
"Submission of the Year".

I knew my skills and told reporters and everyone around me that I was going to strangle Charles.
And I defeated the most dangerous fighter in the cage.
I know that I deserve this award.
Thank you," the UFC press service quotes the fighter as saying.

Crespo named the strengths of Enzo Fernandez, who moved to Chelsea for 121 million euros

In particular, he stated that he was impressed with the player's performance at the recent World Cup.
According to him, the 22-year-old midfielder will be an excellent addition to the "blue" team, as he knows how to play in different positions.
"Fernandez is Macheda plus Lampard.
If you need him to play in the Makélélé position, he can play there very well.
This guy also has a good sense of goal, a good shot from outside the penalty area, so if you need him to play as a striker, like Lampard or Eysien, he can do it," Crespo told the British media.
Recall that Enzo Fernandez moved to Chelsea for 121 million euros.

Prediction for the match of the Club World Championship "Real" - "Al-Hilal" on February 11, 2023
On February 11, the final of the club world football championship will take place at the Prince Moulay Abdullah stadium in the Moroccan city of Rabat.
In the trophy match, Real Madrid will face Al-Hilal from Saudi Arabia.
The game will start at 22:00 Moscow time, and the live broadcast at 21:55 MSK will be shown on the matchtv.ru website and the Match! Football 2 TV channel.
Analysts from the bookmaker company BETCITY consider the "Blancos" huge favorites: you can bet on Real Madrid's victory in regular time with a coefficient of 1.28, with a probability of about 77%.
Success for nominal guests is available for 11.0 (8%).
Even the draw is offered at a significantly lower quote of 6.10 (15%).
Do you believe that the teams will not determine the strongest in 90 minutes?
A bet of 1,000 rubles on a "peaceful" outcome in the event of a win will bring in 6,100 rubles.
You can bet on the triumph of the Madrid team, taking into account extra time and a penalty shootout, for 1.14; this market for Al-Hilal is at 5.80.
The team from Saudi Arabia made it to the final after overcoming two rounds, beating Moroccan "Wydad" in a penalty shootout and Brazilian "Flamenco" in regular time (3:2).
You can bet that the underdog will not lose to the Europeans in 90 minutes for 3.90.
Analysts are anticipating a large number of goals: the total over 2.5 goals is available for 1.53, TM 2.5 - for 2.60.
Blancos are clearly superior to their opponents in class, whose lineup, according to the statistical site Transfermarkt, amounts to only 39.6 million euros.
For comparison: the Real squad is valued at 849 million euros.
In addition, to the horror of Al-Hilal, the main Madrid striker and current holder of the Golden Ball, Karim Benzema, will recover in time for the final.
But even without the Frenchman, Real is performing well in this tournament: in the semi-finals, they defeated Egypt's Al-Ahly 4:1.
The matches of the Arabians were also quite exciting: they drew 1:1 in the quarterfinals and won in a penalty shootout, and in the semifinals, they won a dramatic 3:2.
Recommended bet: Real Madrid win and TB 2.5 at 1.76.
Guberniev spoke about the fact that midfielder Pavel Mamaev has decided to end his playing career.
Famous television commentator Dmitry Guberniev spoke about the fact that midfielder Pavel Mamaev has decided to end his playing career.
"Now it will be possible to cast a bust of the hero in his homeland.
He made a big mistake and for most people he will be remembered not as a footballer, but as a rule-breaking footballer.
But he is still far from Kokorin.
Because no one could have exploited their potential as well as Kokorin.
Despite all his talents, Mamaev was periodically noticeable.
I can only wish him good luck and for him to find success somewhere else," Metaratings.ru quotes Guberenieva as saying.
The last club of the 34-year-old midfielder was Khimki.
The suburban club did not renew the contract with the midfielder in the summer of 2022.
Mamayev previously played for Torpedo, CSKA, Krasnodar, and Rostov.
Mamaev is a Russian champion, three-time winner of the Russian Cup, and two-time winner of the country's Super Cup with CSKA.

A tanker with a diesel engine from a previously Russian-flagged vessel was not allowed into the port of Spain
The Tarragona Maritime Command of the Main Office of the Commercial Fleet under the Spanish Ministry of Transport has prohibited the Maersk Magellan vessel from entering the city's port to unload diesel fuel, since the cargo comes from the Nobel vessel, which flew the Russian flag until July 1, 2022, the Spanish Ministry of Transport reported.
"The Tarragona Naval Command of the Directorate General of Merchant Shipping of the Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Development has prohibited the entry into the port of Tarragona for the unloading of diesel fuel on the vessel Maersk Magellan, which flies the flag of Singapore, because the cargo it is carrying comes from the vessel Noble, which flies the Cameroon flag and until July 1, 2022, flew the Russian flag," the ministry said in a statement.
The measure was adopted in accordance with European Union legislation, which prohibits access for any vessel registered under the Russian flag from April 16, 2022, or that has changed flags after February 24, 2022.
The ministry specified that the inspection was conducted on February 9, after which the ban was agreed upon.
The ministry recalled that this is not the first time that ships have been prohibited from entering Spanish ports.
In April 2022, the port of Barcelona denied access to the Black Star vessel under the Maltese flag, which was transporting cargo from a vessel under the Russian flag.
In 2022, after the EU, the US, and the UK strengthened their anti-Russian sanctions, they introduced restrictions on the supply of Russian petroleum products, and then decided to limit fuel prices.
Since December 5, 2022, a price ceiling has been in effect for sea shipments of oil from the Russian Federation, imposed by unfriendly countries.
At that time, a ceiling was set for Russian oil at $60/barrel.
Also, since December 5, the EU embargo on sea shipments of oil from Russia has been in effect.
The problems that arose for pregnant Russian women with entry into Argentina were explained
According to the expert, against the backdrop of the influx of people wanting to have a child in Argentina, the country's authorities have become more attentive to the entry of foreign citizens into their territory.
The difficulties with the entry of pregnant Russian women into Argentina are connected with the fact that the country's authorities are not interested in a mass influx of foreigners who want to obtain citizenship for their children and a residence permit for themselves, and then leave.
Lenta.ru reports this, citing Professor Vyacheslav Heiphetz of SPbGU, editor-in-chief of the magazine "Latin America".
According to him, no country supports such practices.
He noted that Argentina does not approve of turning the country into a transit point, rather than a final destination.
This applies to those who violate constitutional practice.
As the expert explained, the child will retain Argentine citizenship, but the court will make the decision on whether to grant Argentine citizenship to the parents after they receive a residence permit.
If it turns out that they did not actually live in Argentina and immediately left, citizenship may be denied.
This applies not only to Russians, but also to citizens of other countries.
Recently, as the specialist pointed out, maternity tours to Argentina are especially popular among Russians and Ukrainians.
To recap, Argentina grants citizenship based on the “right of soil”, meaning if a person was born on its territory.
The Argentine passport opens up the possibility of visa-free travel to 170 countries, including EU states and the United Kingdom.
Earlier, it was reported that Argentina had begun to revoke residence permits for Russians who had obtained the document through the birth of a child, but had left the country.
Buenos Aires is interested in reducing such incidents.
It has also been reported that six pregnant Russian citizens were denied entry to Argentina on suspicion of providing false information about the purpose of their trip.
In Russia, the opening of hundreds of new fitness clubs is predicted
In Russia, citizens’ interest in fitness services is recovering, which allows market participants to expand their businesses.
This year, more than 400 new facilities may open in the country, primarily small-format ones.
About 400 new fitness clubs may open in Russia, bringing the total number up by 5 percent.
As Kommersant reports, several dozen players may leave the Russian market.
By the end of the year, there will be about 8,600 clubs in Russia.
According to the publication, the majority of new clubs are small-scale projects with small initial investments and quick payback.
These figures are provided by representatives of the National Fitness Community.
In a conversation with the publication, Olga Kiselyeva, president of the Association of Fitness Industry Operators, noted that the 340-420 new fitness clubs will be small, while the rest will occupy an area of more than 500 square meters.
NFS President Elena Silina noted that since 2020, there have been more closures of clubs than openings each year.
Over the past three years, their number has decreased by 37 percent.
Meanwhile, independent analysts cite other figures.
According to data from Kontur.Fokus, over the past three years, the number of organizations with the primary type of activity “fitness center operation” has grown by 10.1 percent, and now there are 5,120 of them.
The industry suffered significant losses due to the pandemic, but as early as 2021 it began to recover.
According to 2GIS data, there are 4,500 fitness clubs in Russian cities with a population of over a million.
Russians have started to pay more attention to physical activity, as evidenced by the increase in attendance at fitness clubs.
As of January 2023, attendance increased by 9.3 percent year-on-year.
As Silina noted, if the trend continues, then by the end of the year the industry will return to pre-crisis indicators.
The management company from Kirov had its license taken away
The Arbitration Court of the Kirov Region has revoked the business license for managing multi-apartment buildings issued to the management company "Zabota".
In the Kirov region, a decision by the regional Arbitration Court has revoked the license for the management of multi-apartment buildings previously issued to the management company "Zabota".
According to the regional State Housing Inspectorate, the court decision was made back in November 2022, but it only came into legal force in February 2023.
The arbitration panel revoked the "manage-it-yourself" company's license because the organization repeatedly ignored the requirements of the State Housing Inspection.
Currently, all the facilities that were under the management of Zabota have been removed from the register of licenses for the conduct of business activities related to the management of apartment buildings.
Their total area was 64.8 thousand square meters.
All the houses are located in the regional center.
The administration of Kirov is aware that they have been left without a management company.
In accordance with the requirements of Russian law, the State Housing Inspectorate informed the mayor about the situation.
It should be noted that in January 2023, the governor of the Kirov region, Alexander Sokolov, set a goal for the employees of the State Housing Inspectorate to eliminate two-thirds of the region's management companies by spring, since there are too many of them.
The legality of the governor's demands has raised doubts among the communists in Kirov.
They turned to the regional prosecutor's office and asked that Sokolov be held accountable.
Presumably, the Federal Antimonopoly Service could have taken the same position.
Antimonopoly officials also allegedly asked the prosecutor's office to check the legality of the actions of the regional head.

At the same time, they must be designed in certain colors and have a specified image.
The packages are purchased by the owners of PSVs, if this obligation is not fulfilled, a fine of 10,000 rubles is imposed on them for each violation.
Earlier, Wildberries customers accused the platform of debiting funds from cards whose data had previously been deleted from their personal accounts.
As buyers fear, this is associated with great risks to safety.
In turn, the support service explained that this is provided for in the user agreement.
According to the document, the company has the right to debit money from remote cards without notifying the client if payment from other sources does not go through for one reason or another.
The company, commenting on the situation, stated that payments to customers are made with the permission of the customers, and there can be no data leak of bank card information.
Photos from February 2023.
A beautiful place, especially in the summer, around the sculpture of a mammoth with a gazebo and grills.
There is a small park on the territory where you can take a walk with your family.
Large parking lot.
The store is located on the first floor of the Univer City shopping center.
Hours of operation are from 10:00 to 22:00.
You can drink coffee and snack on fresh baked goods in the store.
There is a small parking lot from the shopping center.
Friendly staff!
Delicious coffee, a wide selection of syrups and alternative milk.
Delicious fresh baked goods😍😍😍.
Hearty sandwiches.
Convenient cafeteria area
They came with their daughter to arrange her pension.
They welcomed us warmly, explained everything clearly, scanned our documents, filled out the application, and told us how to sign up for future appointments.
At the entrance, the administrator and security personnel greet you politely and with respect.
The building is decent, everything is equipped for people - there is a hall, a toilet, but a cooler with water would be nice to have.
We came twice and everything was great!
I wish all workers peace, good, luck, and a decent salary in this difficult time for everyone!!!
Just a great place!
After a long walk on the beach, there is nothing better than sitting by the window with a cup of glühwein, waiting for the shrimp salad (which is simply unbeatable in terms of taste!!!)
I highly recommend this wonderful place!!!)))
A sweet cashier asked me if I wanted coffee in the lobby, 200 or 300 ml.
I asked for a 300 ml cup in the room.
A couple of minutes later, I am given a plastic cup.
I wanted to work with ceramics, which is why I am "in the hall".
They did it to me.
I ask why it's in a glass, and not a cup.
The girl responds that they don’t have cups with a volume of 300 ml.
How does this fit into the mind of a person?
Ask yourself or in the store, i.e., determine the technology for yourself: pour coffee into a cup or a disposable cup.
Get the answer — in the room, i.e. in the cup.
Specify the volume.
To hear that 300 ml.
Confront the person with the fact that there are no cups of that size.
Here, look, a paper cup, 300 ml.
It is noteworthy that this is the third such case in the Green Hood that I can remember.
It's doubly noteworthy that I wasn't offered a standard cup so that I could pour the contents of the plastic cup into it and drink the coffee the way I want it. I asked for it myself.
A number of questions arise.
1. Are the Green Corner Cafe and Green Corner two sides of the same coin, or are they unrelated organizations?
If unrelated, understanding appears.
If they are related - why did a food and trade enterprise known in the city for its service and quality stoop to the rhetoric of a kiosk at Kazan Station?
Rhetoric, because this is the third time something like this has happened to me, to repeat.
I don't rule out that this is happening not only to me.
2. Does the cashier have instructions?
I have the impression that she acts on a whim.
I hope I'm wrong.
Please outline the actions for your employees in this case, if you are trying to provide a service.
We really like the circus, we’ve been going there since we were kids.
I saw the numbers with Yury Nikulin himself.
And now, even with children and nephews.
I like the atmosphere at the circus, and I like the shows too.
The location of the places is very convenient.
From almost any point, the arena is visible, and the backs of those in front of you do not obstruct your view.
The circus is very intimate, family-oriented!
This time we went to the New Year's program.
We were a bit disappointed.
A lot of clowns and acrobats.
I would like a room with tricks and more animals.
It's a shame that you can't take photos with the animals in the foyer now.
But apparently there are reasons for this.
And overall, it is a very pleasant place!!
I wish you prosperity and to continue to delight us with your performances!!!
I liked the developer, Otdeystroi, which chooses good locations for building residential complexes.
They use high-quality materials, which fully justifies the price.
Before the purchase, we were invited to view the complex, when there were still no walls, so that we could see everything in person, although we looked at apartments so many times and not one developer offered us this.
Favourite ski resort in Russia!
The most fun is in the gentle, sparse forests, especially when there is a lot of soft snow.
But the tracks are boring and short, in my opinion.
The longest on the sector e, there are even fewer of them.
But overall, there is a great atmosphere, with lots of different cafes and bars, so a fun skiing mood is guaranteed!
Great work, Peri!
I did everything as quickly and efficiently as possible, and the interior was clean and pleasant.
Good service, friendly staff, there is a cloakroom and water.
Disgusting service.
The second time I came to pick up my order at the time specified in the app, and I waited by the windowsill for more than 30 minutes for my order.
Today, such a service is unacceptable in business!
The response from the "care" service is that we are trying.
At the box office, even without an apology, simply - we are not to blame, it's the program.
You couldn't call to warn them, and you didn't find any other technical means of communication with your previously loyal customers.
Impotent men “try”, but businesses need to work.
Thank you all, everyone is leaving.
We will not be ordering from you again, and we will not be recommending you either.
A spoiled mood, anticipation of guests, apologies from the hostess - not the best sauce for hot rolls.
I ordered a car (Jeep Wrangler Sahara) through the organization.
The car was supposed to be delivered in 3-3.5 months (as agreed), but it actually took 4.5 months – the delay was caused by the situation on the border between Lithuania and Belarus (Lithuania was responsible).
In the end, I am very happy with the car, thank you guys - Dmitry, Stas, and Alexander - always available, up-to-date information, professional advice, and a good human attitude.
Thank you again!
We rented a cottage for 4 days for 3 people.
The cabins are clean, cozy, and warm (even very warm), and they have their own small kitchen with coffee, tea, sugar, spices, sunflower oil, and all the necessary dishes.
Cleaning solution and a sponge are available.
The disadvantages include the fact that there is not enough space, and the shower in the bathroom is incredibly small.
There are no designated places to store snowboards or skis, and there is nowhere to dry clothes, so we had to borrow a dryer from the owners and shove it in place of a chair, and then put a heater under it.
But overall, it's a pretty good option in a quiet area.
Stylish, clean, spacious.
The food is delicious, and the selection of dishes is sufficient for the needs of any guest.
Prices are reasonable.
There is wine and beer for those who want to drink.
Center of Moscow, I recommend it
A wonderful place with very polite staff, we will definitely come back.
All necessary amenities are available on the premises, including parking and billiards.
Rooms with good renovations and all amenities.
A beautiful and aesthetically pleasing place, we took a walk there during our visit to Kaliningrad.
I really enjoyed it, both the miniature Russia and the Ozerov Park and the landscape.
In the winter, there are many natural hills for children)
A very cool tobacco and hookah shop)
We constantly buy here, the prices are low, and the quality is top-notch!
The staff is very responsive and will help and answer all questions you may have)
I recommend this store for everyone to visit! ❤️
Location is where it is most convenient for everyone.
It's normal for me personally.
They serve quickly, if none of the visitors messes up.
It's convenient to make an appointment.
The staff is attentive, they will advise, direct, and consult even if you come outside of the reception hours.
In principle, it's fine.
Great guys!
Thank you so much!
Everything was done quickly and efficiently, and the prices are reasonable compared to other services.
I thought it was a remote control for the release, and they are all so clever that they did it for me.
A huge thank you to the young guys!
I ordered a bouquet of 21 tulips with delivery 2 hours before March 8.
They delivered the flowers in a package that looked like it had been stolen (there was barely enough paper to wrap the flowers).
Then, when the flowers were already in the vase, I realized that something was wrong.
I compared it to the photo on the website, and the color was completely different from what I ordered.
I decided to count them again, and it turned out that there were an even number of tulips, 20 in total.
Support on WhatsApp responded to my complaints about the color and quantity of flowers with "apparently they mixed up the color."
The next day, I wrote again and was offered to reimburse 15%.
It seems to me that this is the utmost degree of impudence and most likely falls under the definition of fraud.
I have already submitted a statement to the tax authorities about the fact that they refused to issue me a receipt.
Rospotrebnadzor and the court are next in line.
I would not recommend anyone to deal with this organization.
For more than 10 years, I have been going to the master Samira for coloring and haircuts.
I want to cancel The professionalism of the master Samira, she does a great job, I am always satisfied with her work.
She always listens carefully to the client's wishes, and the client is always satisfied with the result.
I would confidently recommend this master to all relatives and friends.
All of her work is always of the highest quality!!!’
A huge thank you to Master Samira 😍
I was at this gaming club and I can say that the prices are great, there are many gaming computers, as well as drinks and food.
Some of the downsides are that the keys break off and the keyboard is poorly optimized for “normal gameplay” :(
Therefore, the rating is 4🥸
This place has become our family tradition)
The son goes to his group, and his mother goes to the fitbox in the evening.
The administrators are super-attentive, and the trainers are professional.
They organize themed holidays for children, and keep an eye on cleanliness and the equipment.
It's nice to go and practice.
A 6-year-old child can already withstand a strong blow and strong OCP.
Recommended for children, moms, and dads)
The best craftsmen!
Irina is just gold!!
She does a good job, is caring, and checks everything.
You can always talk about something with girls!
It was the third time!
I would not regret it for anything!
Finally, I can grow my hair after lightening it! !!!
And Vita is also studying color theory.
That is why it will soon be able to combine blonde with keratin!
And your hair will thank you🥰🥰
The master receptionist, Elena Polianskaya, is a very responsive master, who clearly explained everything that is included in the routine maintenance.
She also provided all kinds of assistance during the repair of my car.
And also thanks to master Valery Ushakov for his attentive and professional work.
He was ready to answer any question.
The work was done well.
The only thing that confused me when I went for the inspection was the insufficiently correct information about the work regulations, but when I showed up for the inspection, the regulations were more clearly explained.
I want to express my deepest gratitude to the Administration staff.
A very rare certificate from the child welfare agency was needed to approve the real estate transaction, and the employees were very friendly and helped to fill out the certificate, although they could have refused, since it is not their responsibility.
Thank you very much!
Very kind people work here.
Wonderful, warm, and polite staff, I am glad I came to this particular hair salon!👍
Master Nakhid did an impeccable dye job, haircut, and took into account and understood all of my wishes; I would definitely recommend her to everyone❤️
I really enjoyed the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin.
It was restored for its 800th anniversary, and everything inside is stylish and clean.
There are also cafes and toilets for tourists.
I went on a tour, which was also great.
And I definitely recommend the Russian collection of the Nizhny Novgorod art museum - an unexpectedly beautiful collection
I have known Olya for more than 3 years and we use her services regularly.
During this time, we have seen how Olya has developed in her favourite profession, is constantly learning new things, and the space for the four-legged animals is expanding, which only inspires admiration and trust.
We always leave our puppy with a calm mind.
Daily video reports will be taken/removed by a zootaxi if necessary.
And they will also bring something clean and tasty)
in general, a fairy tale 🥰
We thank you for your care and attentive personal approach to our pets 🐕💜
The Satiated Elk restaurant is located near the Medvedkovo metro station.
The restaurant is very cozy!
They prepare delicious dishes.
The menu is varied.
It is advisable to order seats in advance before visiting, especially on Fridays!
A lovely well-maintained zoo.
Less than Moscow, but just as interesting and convenient.
It was a weekday - the adult entrance was 300₽, the student entrance was 170.
There were not many people, but we enjoyed walking around and looking at the animals.
The mammoth impressed him)
By the way, he hasn't been seen in Moscow.
There are a couple of cafes on the premises with reasonable prices, the toilets are clean and free, and we also saw a phone charging station.
In general, I recommend it 👍
The salon is top-notch!!!
I am very satisfied with the services of cosmetologist Kuznetsova Natalia, I only go to her.
I do various facial cleanses – both mechanical and with a device.
I am 100% satisfied.
A master of their craft👍
She tells me all about the specifics of my skin, and she picked out skincare products that are suitable for my skin type, it’s just perfect.
I am now happy and beautiful!!!
Thank you, Natalia!!!
A great club with a huge space, a swimming pool, a sauna, a hammam, and excellent trainers!
The downside is the huge number of pensioners in the pool and the changing room area.
It feels like they come to the club as if it were a public bath!
Particular emphasis on the women's department.
During the week, starting at 7 PM, there are a lot of people!
I give it a three, and only because of the first visit, when I saw a consultant, if I'm not mistaken, Timur, but I could be wrong.
I quickly filled out everything, explained everything +/-, everything was clear, my son also decided to apply for a card, and alas, the consultants were busy with their own affairs, customers were waiting, a consultant eventually approached my son, who was very knowledgeable, and went to the negotiation room several times, discussing something amusing, in the end, my son left without applying, the consultant said that he could do whatever he wanted, since I was present at this meeting, I was surprised.
The new office, in the new format, is comfortable and the attitude is like this.
It's a shame that the first impression was ruined, now we visit another branch, and the attitude towards customers doesn't depend on the change of staff.
The selection is very large, the quality is good (the fabric is resistant to pilling), the staff know their range, and they help with choosing styles.
It is possible to dress both a slim child and a child with an unusual figure and height.
They are located near the metro, and there is even a small parking lot.
We recommend it!
He was in September, celebrating his birthday.
In principle, the service and the quality of the food were all to my liking: the prices are low, the portions are of a medium size, so you can eat until you are full, or order again.
The only complaint is the reservation of a table.
When I ordered, I gave the number and everything else that was required, after which I immediately called the bot to check the phone.
There's nothing left to do.
When he arrived at the restaurant itself, it turned out that the table had not been reserved.
It was lucky that there were free seats and we managed to get a place.
But, in fact, it is a very good restaurant with an excellent price/quality ratio.
I recommend it!
I went for a cleaning in the recent weekend.
For the first time, I see such an organized staff, who took a maximum of care with many of my questions, and advised me on how and what to do for further treatment of my tooth cavity.
I wholeheartedly recommend it, the only clinic where they don't want to make a profit from me to my knowledge.
A good shopping center.
Everything is here!
A wide range of products.
A variety of shops.
You can always find something to your liking.
From food to gifts.
I will never step foot in this store again.
bought a washing machine, said that we live outside the city, so we will pick it up ourselves.
The manager in the lobby said where to drive up to the warehouse, when asked if they would "load" it, he said yes. ())
they took it out of the warehouse without the box, and when asked why, they replied that that's how everything is loaded.
when I insisted, they stuck two strips of foam rubber in, like, it'll be fine!
They refused to load onto the trailer, saying it wasn’t their job, load it yourself, they have delivery )))
when I said that I would then refuse the order, they said "okay, whatever you want, it doesn't matter to us", in the end, one of them even went so far as to go down the ramp and help my father push the car into the trailer.
I am facing such rude service for the first time.
A good shopping center. Very clean. A wide selection of shops and cafes with restaurants.
There is a Cosmic movie theater and the "Nevidailia" children's entertainment center.
On the lower level, there is a large Lenta hypermarket.
Convenient, large parking and a convenient location.
A good supermarket for cosmetics, underwear and household goods.
A diverse range of products, reasonable prices, polite, attentive staff.
Consultants will definitely help with the selection and provide advice.
Everyone will find something necessary for themselves.
A good place to spend an evening.
The staff are very good, a pleasant establishment.
I would advise everyone to never make a mistake in their choice. The best establishment in Krasnodar where you can relax and everything will be super.
I recommend visiting)
We would like to express our gratitude to Marina Chasova, who was our agent for organizing the funeral.
When she came to us at our request, she took on the responsibility of resolving all the issues related to this difficult and sad event, helped us choose everything we needed, was always available and kept us informed about how things were going.
Thanks to her, we were able to give a worthy send-off to our loved one.
Everything was arranged and clearly organized, just as we discussed at our first meeting.
Marina, who is well aware of the state of her loved ones, gave advice on how to proceed and simply empathized with us.
He is a very good specialist in his field.
Thank you for everything.
Having been swayed by the many good reviews, I contacted RemsTirMash and they assigned me master Alexander.
He began the conversation by saying that the next day he would be completely free and ready to serve.
They discussed everything and set a time - 14.00.
The next day came - a call in the morning from the master and a statement that he would not be able to come, a complicated request (what is this? and where is "completely free"?), and if he can, he will come after 18:00 instead of the scheduled 14:00.
We agreed to meet again the following day.
15 minutes before the scheduled time, another master calls and says that instead of Alexander, someone else can come, but in 2 hours.
What kind of tricks are these?
One and a half days of empty waiting, all the planned things put on the side!
In short, a competent master named Ivan arrived, fixed the problem, for which I am grateful.
So don’t be fooled by empty promises and don’t waste your time.
The evening observations did not live up to expectations at all.
First, there was a short lecture with incomprehensible material, then we looked through the telescope.
Everything was not very organized, children kept trying to watch it multiple times, adults crowded around and couldn't let others watch.
The objects we viewed through the telescope were the size of a regular star, and you can view them for free without a telescope.
The girl answered the questions in a not very accessible way, not realizing that ordinary people do not know many of the nuances.
It is not clear why 600 rubles.
An amazing place, one of the oldest Mexican restaurants in the city, it has been around since the early 2000s.
A cozy atmosphere, always friendly service.
The price is average.
Sit down and eat 2-3 dishes for two (the portions are very large) + a cocktail, about 2500 rubles👌
There are interesting beer cocktails, based on beer and tequila, for example, Macho Boracho, which I highly recommend trying.
Price: 420 rubles for 0.5 l.
And in general, the food at the restaurant itself is very tasty, I don’t know about others, but I really enjoyed it, and I will recommend that my friends go there)
This is a great store, I have been buying goods from them for a long time, since they first opened.
Good quality products.
I bought a mixer five years ago, and it still works perfectly and is in good condition.
That is why, when we renovated the apartment, we bought everything we needed here.
Excellent gas station!!!
It is located in a very convenient location, there is both the city center and the countryside, in general, it is convenient)!
The quality of the gas is good, I fill up twice a week for more than 2 years, there are no problems, the price is great!!!
The cubs are not cheating by the map and for cash, by the liter.
The store, I liked it!
You can choose any model at a democratic price and for any purpose!
Staff are always ready to help with your selection.
I lent my daughter a laptop for studying, because hers was broken.
They helped, found a replacement, and gave a guarantee (for a month). Thank you! 👍
A sommelier is working.
he helped with the selection of wine, because it's difficult to figure it out on your own with such a large menu.
Vasily is an interesting, charming sommelier, and there aren’t enough of them in Moscow.
I ate the pike-perch – it was magical, chef, well done.
The children's menu is the same as everywhere else: pasta, fries, chicken nuggets. I ordered pizza, it's AMAZING here!
Adults enjoyed the truffles, while children enjoyed the sausage and mushrooms.
My husband ate smoked ribs - they were amazing, soft, juicy, and aromatic.
The staff are good, all smiling and friendly.
We liked it.
The brand new WB pickup point is located in a convenient location.
The schedule is from 10:00 to 21:00, without weekends or holidays.
Inside the PVZ there are changing rooms.
A very good place.
Real professionals work here, who are always ready to help.
There is also a group and chat on Vkontakte for informative communication.
Fast delivery.
It is a relief that the goods can be immediately viewed and tried on.
It's great that it's near the house.
A great, modern hotel.
The room is spacious, very clean and cozy.
Everything that is stated in the description is available.
Breakfast is included in the price, with a wide selection of dishes to suit every taste.
Convenient entrance, private parking near the entrance.
Solid 5.
A wonderful puppet theater.
We often go to different performances.
Today we went to see the play "The Frog Princess".
At the moment, this is the best thing about children's performances.
It was really interesting, lots of dolls, special effects.
Even the 14-year-old son went along just for the company, but said that it was a very good performance.
I went on a 10-day vacation with my husband in January 2023.
The vacation was a success at "5", everything was great!
I'll start in order:
On the day of arrival, they called to confirm the time of our arrival and gave us information about the cost of the transfer (1400 from the airport), we ordered a taxi (at 23:00 the price was 850 rubles), we arrived quickly, there were no traffic jams, they let us through the gate without any problems.
The administrative building is nearby, and they processed everything quickly, in about 15-20 minutes.
All the buildings have an elevator, which is a big plus!
The 2-person room is spacious, with warm floors in the room and bathroom (without heating), a huge balcony with rattan furniture (table and two chairs), panoramic windows (in building 5).
The furniture in the room is normal, there is a ladies' table with a large mirror, the fridge is not exactly small, and there is even a freezer.
There are a lot of green plants in Building 5.
Everything is clean, they change towels and linens as you wish, but if you don’t ask for a change, they still change them on the 4th day, and the linens are of good quality.
The territory is well-maintained, there are benches everywhere, clean sidewalks, and beautiful lighting at night.
A minibus runs to the beach and back every 30 minutes.
Until the public transport stops, it is 5 minutes.
In the dining hall, the friendly staff always wish you a good day.
The food is decent, but everyone has their own preferences, and we were all satisfied. The selection and quality were always good, with fish and chicken and other dishes, vegetables as a side dish every day, homemade tasty pastries, more than four drinks, coffee beans, they always bake pancakes for breakfast, but the cheese and sausage are not very good.
The medical staff are very friendly and loyal.
We were also lucky with the weather, there was no rain, the temperature was 11-16°C, and the sun was shining.
Everything was great, we really had a good time.
There is a desire to come again, and specifically in January, when there are fewer vacationers).
It is a shame that the swimming pool and the fitness center will not be put into operation.
Thank you to the entire team of the sanatorium for their well-coordinated and high-quality work!
We have been going to "Polet" since August.
Daughter turned 4 in September.
Everything is exactly what she likes, the coach praises her) that's the most important thing.
We are going to see Valeria Nikolaevna Pleshkova!)
I never would have thought that my daughter is so flexible!
While wandering through the streets of St. Petersburg, my friends and I decided to check out this promising establishment — and we were not disappointed!
The prices are very affordable, and the incredibly delicious pizza is gone in the blink of an eye, not even the crusts are left.
A pleasant atmosphere and charming staff, in short, I recommend it :)
It just so happened that I ended up in Tomarovskaya Hospital with high blood pressure and a racing heart.
I was extremely surprised: the cleanliness, order, wet cleaning twice, moreover, the windowsills, furniture, and doors are wiped down.
The food is baby food, but it is excellent!!!
I was surprised that at 7 in the morning they brought tea with a sandwich (bread, butter, cheese), so to speak, a pre-breakfast.
The medical staff are sensitive, everyone is giving injections intramuscularly and intravenously!!!
While the drip is going, they will come in, ask how you are feeling...
I have had a heart ultrasound before, but this is the first time (unfortunately, I don’t know the name of the doctor, he is a young man).
Special thanks to the attending physician Vetokhina Klavdia Fedorovna!
A true professional: attentive, knowledgeable, provides a comprehensive answer to any question; she selected the dosage and medications that normalized both my blood pressure and heart rate, which I was previously unable to achieve after consulting other doctors.
A huge thank you to the head doctor, Mevsha Olga Vladimirovna, who organized the coordinated work of the hospital!!!
Thanks to the medical staff, the cleaners, and the porters!
The impression left after visiting the customer service department was good.
The administrator greeted me at the chole.
Knowledgeable and polite specialists quickly and patiently help customers with all the questions they have.
The specialist assisted me in filing the application and provided explanations regarding my question.
For a small store, the selection of goods is quite good.
There are semi-finished products, milk, vegetables, household chemicals, and all sorts of other things.
It operates 24 hours a day, which is very convenient, and the staff is always friendly
It's great when there is a place in the city where you can go skiing.
The bumper lifts are certainly busy on weekends, with a 40-second wait and a 5-10 minute queue.
But on the whole, it’s great, immersing oneself in the atmosphere of positivity and winter, even if there is mud and dampness on the roads.
I contacted the service for repairing an iPhone 11 Pro.
The rear window was smashed and the battery needed to be replaced.
I contacted the master, Alexander, who explained all the details of the repair and immediately set the price range.
Thank you for the renovation, everything was done well.
The masters are very pleasant to talk to, they will show everything and tell everything.
However, when the parts were replaced, the camera was hit, and the focus was off.
I immediately reported the problem and received a quick response.
The error was corrected as quickly as possible, everything is working properly.
There are good specialists in this service, with whom it is a pleasure to have a dialogue.
Prices, in comparison with other services, are reasonable, affordable.
If the repairs are needed again, I will definitely contact you!
On a grand scale, beautiful, atmospheric.
But, like most historical objects, the state requires close, prompt, and high-quality attention from restorers.
Therefore, 4 and most of these stars are given to creators, not maintainers
Great apartment building
Responsive concierges, garbage is collected, the area is clean and beautiful, close to bus stops, schools, and shops.
20 minutes to the metro by public transport
We opened a good, cozy place to relax in our area.
There are all the necessary shops.
A killing and diverse food court in terms of food.
The tables are located in cozy areas.
There is no crowding.
Well, we went, we tried...
The interior has nothing in common with a cozy Italian café...
There are very few seats, and the tables are rectangular, like in a cafeteria.
Pizza... well, who hasn't tried something tastier, so it seemed to me to be somewhat faceless.
It wasn't very pleasant that the waiter was always standing behind you and was almost always looking your interlocutor in the face.
We were uncomfortable.
Connelly, yes, delicious.
We will not come here again and I will not recommend it to my friends.
Lena Grosskopf is the best hairdresser I have ever been to.
She does everything very carefully and well, I go to her with pleasure, I understand that everything will be done perfectly.
I only take my daughter to see Lena.
The atmosphere in the cabin is amazing.
Thank you so much!
We broke down on the way from Nizhny, but the kind people from KatResource quickly responded and helped!
Respect to you and prosperity, there should be more good people like you!
And the server is clean and well-maintained!
They came to see Sergei Chigarkov's concert.
A great concert venue, with great sound and atmosphere.
We will definitely come to the planned concerts this year.
A peaceful place, a wonderful Georgian restaurant, on weekends and holidays live music is played!
The staff are nice and responsive!
There is a children's room.
Delicious Georgian cuisine!
The rating is the highest, I adore this place ❤
The park is in the city center, very easy to get to.
The park is clean, and there is space for both children and adults.
But there has long been no sand in the playground, only dust.
There is also a fenced-in soccer field, which, unfortunately, is not very well-maintained.
But there are more advantages in our park.
A spacious hall, clean, clear arrangement of goods.
There are products that can only be bought at the Crossroads.
The staff are friendly.
I didn't eat bad products.
Often stocks and discounts.
It's good that it's close to home.
You can always find a parking space.
I’ve been to the bar twice, and I liked everything about it: the friendly staff, the tasty food, and most importantly, the great music, the DJs know what they’re doing.
The only thing is that the lead singer of the group "Ruki Vverkh Band" is disappointing the second time around.
Not only does he sing, to put it mildly, not very well, but he also reads the lyrics of most of the songs from his phone, which was particularly striking when it was the songs of the group "Ruki Vverkh".
It's somehow illogical (performing at the Hands Up bar, in the Hands Up Band group).
We went on vacation at the beginning of March.
A good hotel, pleasant rooms.
For her birthday, they gave her a room with a view of the Kremlin.
Room cleaning every day.
Refilling water, tea, coffee, shampoo, and changing towels.
Breakfasts are just a waste of time.
There is a mini bar with insane prices.
If you want to order room service from the restaurant, you will have to pay a 20% service charge on top.
The prices in the restaurant are slightly inflated.
It tastes like three and a half.
The water park was included in the cost of accommodation.
The water park itself cannot be called the best in Russia.
But the masseuse was just amazing.
Everything is great, but the departure was a bit disappointing: no goodbye or good road.
The employee at the entrance didn’t even help open the door when he saw women with a bunch of bags and suitcases.
This needs to be worked on in order to maintain our reputation.
A great place to get together with friends and have a soak.
A large and comfortable sauna, there is billiards, an outdoor pool, and karaoke.
The food is delicious, and the drinks are fresh)
A workshop at a high level!
In a short amount of time, he has already repaired 3 pairs of shoes (2 men's and 1 women's).
Everything is fine.
Quality work at height.
Special thanks to the master for their careful approach and quality of work!
A wonderful basketball school!
The son is 5 months old and he really likes it, he looks forward to every training session.
An individual approach to children, interesting activities, a warm and friendly atmosphere.
The store is great, the staff will go, I order online myself.
Great location of the store.
Plus, there are always discounts and promotions, which is also good.
A good AV store - convenient location, large hall, good range of products.
Special thanks to the staff for their helpfulness!
There are cafeterias with several tables.
I visit often - everything is fine!
A good pool!
I am specifically talking about the "frogs", our coach Anastasia Vitalyevna is very liked by the child and is professional!!
The locker rooms are clean, the water is warm, and there are hairdryers!
I love the bakery's cakes, the service, the croissants, the breakfasts and the coffee are always top notch.
But alas, not this time, I ordered coffee and a couple of croissants, the girls at the cash register never made the coffee until I reminded them, they made it, but it was impossible to drink, it smelled bad and left a taste of spoiled milk, I decided not to finish it and just left.
Last time there was a long black hair in my coffee, they replaced it.
Please be more careful, I am a guest returning here, even after such incidents.
Gorgeous eyebrows are what it's all about!
Victoria adjusts it perfectly, taking into account all the proportions of the face individually.
Correction with warm wax, which effectively removes all the fluff, and the eyebrows look neat for a long time.
The color is selected based on the type of hair and skin, which ensures that the paint lasts a long time.
It's better not to do the eyebrows!
Thank you so much for organizing my mom's move!
Moving is always a huge stress, but with your company everything went very smoothly, quickly, and efficiently.
Special thanks to Vadim and Roman!
I will recommend your company to all my acquaintances!
Everything is top-notch.
We have been treating our teeth as a family at NovoDent for a long time.
Recently, I had my 8-year-old son’s teeth treated, everything went perfectly, the child is calm and ready to come back.
You don’t have to wait long, and there are no queues because the appointment is by prior arrangement.
In my opinion, the most delicious shawarma in Tambov is only here, I am not a shawarma lover, BUT when I want something naughty, only here and only here.
Tasty, fresh meat with lots of fillings.
And I don't understand why, but it never flows out of me.
Often when you finish a shawarma, you can’t eat it anymore because there’s a lot of sauce and water, in short, fufu... but not here.
That’s why you guys are the best🙂
A good teaching staff.
The cafeteria always serves fresh food.
Interesting lessons in the school museum, various events are held throughout the school year
A pleasant store, friendly staff, not a bad selection.
However, the big downside is that the goods that are brought in are apparently destroyed right in the store.
Sometimes there is little space to walk between the rows, and it's also not very pleasant when the goods are just lying on the floor without any pallets, but this is more of a remark about the organization, rather than a specific store
A delightful example of Soviet architecture.
Strict magnificence, which is carefully tended to.
I had a double pleasure from the concert, largely thanks to the atmosphere of the cultural center.
While we waited in the foyer for the start, I clearly felt that I had come to the Event, that this was really a coming out into the light.
I was looking for a clutch kit for my MB Sprinter.
I ended up in this online auto parts store completely by chance.
I called, gave them the order number, and they said wait)
After 10 minutes, they called back and offered several options.
Since the car is a personal work vehicle, he didn’t want to skimp and asked to order a good set of LUK clutch parts.
Another 5 minutes later, they called back and said that there was good news for you.
If you don’t take the entire basket + disc + scraper, but take the LUK basket + disc kit and the separate LUK scraper separately, it will be cheaper by 2 thousand rubles, which couldn’t be a pleasant surprise.
After taking the clutch, he went to the service center.
When removing the gearbox, it was discovered that a flywheel was also needed, and the sooner the better.
I already knew where to go), the manager understood the situation and ordered without prepayment over the phone (paid for it the first time when I received it).
The following day, the crankshaft was in hand.
The car is quite happy with the new crankshaft and clutch, I’m happy that everything arrived quickly, that they went out of their way.
I will definitely recommend and use vinkod.shop again.
The New Year's party was a huge success, but with some nuances.
I booked a two-seater table, but it turned out they seated me at a four-seater.
But no problem.
It's just strange that they didn't warn us.
The kitchen was a four, and the fish was a complete failure.
The host with the school-level contests, to be honest, is not very good.
BUT everything is perfect when it comes to the music.
The atmosphere was at its best.
Everything else seems like nitpicking.
Thank you for the event
I am leaving my review with words of gratitude to all the staff of Maternity Hospital No. 7 in Chelyabinsk.
Only people who know and love their work work at this institution, doctors and nurses are top-notch.
Both in the OB department, the maternity ward, and the postpartum ward.
But I would like to express special thanks to Kotlyarova E.Yu., the head nurse of the maternity ward on the 5th floor, and Yarantseva N.V., the obstetrician in the maternity ward, thank you so much for your help during the birth of my daughter, for your kind hearts, and for your great professionalism.
A wonderful store.
A wide range of balloons, always fast order processing and delivery.
Professional staff.
Very beautiful bouquets, always left with great taste, always fresh flowers.
We visited the establishment on the recommendation of others.
The food is amazing, the entertainment is non-existent, the waiters are a bit cheeky, but we were in great company with children and celebrating an important event, they were friendly.
There was no fire delivery, the children were waiting.
You can safely go for good food.
