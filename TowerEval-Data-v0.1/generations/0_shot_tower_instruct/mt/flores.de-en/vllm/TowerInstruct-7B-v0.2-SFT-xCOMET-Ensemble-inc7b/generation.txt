This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely accepted, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown on the upper side and light or carotinoid-colored on the underside.
The find also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft, called the rachis, but do have other features of feathers - barbs and barbules - the researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suspected that the sample, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, shows the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chick.
The researchers claimed that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the plumage of an adult and not a juvenile.
A car bomb exploded in the morning of yesterday in the police headquarters of the Turkish Gaziantep, killing two policemen and injuring over twenty other people.
According to the governor's office, 19 of the injured are police officers.
The police said they suspected a militant supporter of Daesh (ISIL) behind the attack.
They have discovered that the sun works on the same basic principles as other stars: it has been discovered that the activity of all stars in the system is driven by their luminosity, rotation, and nothing else.
To determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow, the luminosity and the rotation are taken into account together.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of reversals of the magnetic field.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon attracts the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way also exerts gravitational forces on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists concluded that dark matter acts on other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter is located in a kind of halo around a galaxy and consists of many small particles.

In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a pre-printed sheet of paper, on which the candidate of their choice is listed, into an envelope.
After the officials have confirmed the voter's identity, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law sets the procedure quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that there are no envelopes present at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are inserted, except those of the properly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to attend every part of the process as witnesses. On the evening, the votes of volunteers are counted under strict supervision and according to special procedures.

Her first race was the slalom, in which she received a "did not finish" in her first run. 36 of the 116 participants achieved the same result in this race.
In her other race, the giant slalom, she finished in 10th place in the women's group with a combined time of 4:41.30. This was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-placed Austrian Claudia Lösch and 1:09.02 minutes faster than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, who took ninth place.
Four skiers from the Krückenskifahren team did not make it to the finish line, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom were unable to place in the race.
The police of Madhya Pradesh have found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and seized her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanja, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car crashed in, none of them were injured.
The driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
As a result, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was in the meantime charged with the murder of her son before the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in custody pending trial and charges, but eyewitness accounts could be tainted because her image has been widely published.
This is standard practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently, and the courts have deemed the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes: "Journalists seem to be crossing a dangerous line when they publish photos etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is leading the prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made until at least the indictment.
According to the leak, the document refers to the border dispute, in which the Palestinians demand a return to the borders before the Six-Day War of 1967.
Other topics that are supposedly covered include the future of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years from the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority wants to accept such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the accompanying trial to control the plague should be closely supervised by riders, as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the managing director of Park Conservation and Heritage in the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety and training.
Martelly swore in a new provisional electoral commission (CEP) with nine members yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP within four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of the package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to widespread regime-critical protests that began in October.
The trigger for the sometimes violent protests was the failure to hold elections, some of which have been pending since 2011.
Over 60 cases of overheating have been reported in defective iPods, resulting in six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
"Last week, METI announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company described as 'not serious'."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay of the report "really regrettable."
The earthquake shook Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Office of Disaster Management of the Northern Mariana Islands said that no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and there are at least six confirmed deaths so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the place of an elderly lady when she had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a medical career.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature labor in his free time.
His research showed that the application of a hormone accelerated the lung maturation of the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Luna's wrestling colleagues also paid tribute to him.
"Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of the extremes. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Very unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented: "Luna was just as crazy as me ... maybe even crazier ... I love her and will miss her ... hopefully she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, the proportion of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The then-acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared during the 2010 federal election campaign that in her opinion, Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
29 percent of respondents said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medalist at the Olympic Games was supposed to swim in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was called into question due to his many ailments.
He was not able to take the medication he needed to overcome his pain, as it is banned at the Commonwealth Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Numerous people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software at the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for the Earth, along with organic matter that can form proteins and enable life.
Since comets collided with the Earth a long time ago, scientists hope to gain insights into how planets, especially the Earth, are formed.
Cuomo (53) took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described the rumors as "political nonsense and nonsense."
It is speculated that he could run for the office of president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions each year.
It relies on satellite-based technology instead of the older technology based on ground radar, to enable air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transportation will be set up and the above-ground trains will not stop at Wembley. There are no parking lots or park-and-ride facilities available on site.
With concerns about lack of transportation, the likelihood grew that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had developed within just two generations, although it was previously assumed that this process took much longer due to the mating between a native Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrated cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into various forms. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued to other metal. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures, called illuminated manuscripts, in books, which are called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The coal juice changes its color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemicals.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then shape them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of protective layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, which was connected to an elaborate sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, which men and women visited in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it almost immediately back down.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and our view somewhat.
It takes a giant rocket with a height of more than 100 feet to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest service the wheel has provided us is much simpler and faster transport.
It has brought us the railway, the car and many other means of transport.
Among them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
After all, there are still many small cats (including stray house cats) that eat much smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche, a special task that every cat has and which ensures that they do not compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups called prides.
The packs consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and young.
Women usually have a close relationship with each other when they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave in a similar way to wolf or dog packs, animals that surprisingly resemble lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior and are just as deadly towards their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (albeit not particularly well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with the fivefold strength of a strong person.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger does not sound like the full-throated roar of the lion, but rather like a sentence made up of grumbling, growled words.
Ocelots eat small animals. When they can, they prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are significantly smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate their prey with their sense of smell, sniffing where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and move unnoticed. Ozelots hunt their prey by optically matching their surroundings and then attacking their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originated (e.g. when it moves over a mountain range or a river, or when it migrates to a new island, so that it cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different features or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what it needed before.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adjustments as before.
Over time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, and then it looks less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, two populations can look so different that they can no longer be assigned to the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants generate the oxygen that humans breathe in and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., breathe out).
Plants produce their food through photosynthesis using the sun. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. We mainly eat plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other Mosasaurus.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, in addition to another set on the palate, which meant that there was no escape for any animal that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a forked tongue. He fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and may have even been a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that came into the water; even a large dinosaur like the T. Rex was no match for him.
While most of their diet may be familiar to us, the Romans did have their share of strange or unusual feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a seven-toothed mouse.
Another difference was that the poor people and women ate their meals while sitting on chairs, while the rich men preferred to have joint banquets, where they lay on their sides while eating their meals.
Dishes from ancient Rome could not contain foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
The gods were offered sacrifices and the priests tried to comply with the will of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open courtyard and then an inner altar room, which only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called zikkurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses did not have such a great significance.
The majority of the Hebrew family's life took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard. Shops consisted of shop windows open to the street. Stone was used for house building.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the old Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder. When he continued westward, he found Greenland and gave it the name Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although all countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie "The Legacy of the Templars", you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence had the words "original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776" written on it. The text is upside down on the bottom of the document.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (which measures 29¾ inches x 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage at the beginning of its life.
It is therefore possible that the remark was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landing and the subsequent fighting liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
"It was ruled by the 'Vichy' French. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were working with the conquerors, rather than fighting them."
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
After only two weeks, the Americans and the French liberation troops had liberated the south of France and were heading towards Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city state, and which also somehow defines the size of a society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and appropriate dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as legitimate civilizations.
During the revolutionary struggles, the 13 states formed a weak central government based on the Federal Treaty, which consisted only of the Congress.
The Congress was not authorized to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on the authorities of the states to enforce all its laws, which often did not cooperate.
He also had no authority to suspend tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all states before they could be changed, and the states took the central government so little seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful in the world, after the German national football team, and was the 2006 FIFA World Champion.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions and Italians participate in international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
"Due to the cluster/group of islands, Japan is often geographically referred to as an "archipelago"."
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed by there and documented the name of the island as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a settlement in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a change in the indigenous people's rice cultivation methods and employing Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Dynasty government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists mainly of three buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most widely used still image format worldwide is 35 mm, which corresponds to the predominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its image format has been adopted from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
To be precise, the so-called 35 mm format measures 36 mm wide and 24 mm high, which is confusing.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore referred to as 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) have the same or a very similar aspect ratio.
The oft-maligned and often ridiculed thirds rule is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining a sense of order in an image.
It states that the intersection point of the lines that divide an image vertically and horizontally is the most effective place for the main motif (see example).
During this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion has held European states together despite different languages and customs.
His omnipotence controlled everyone, from the king to the simple citizen.
One of the important Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that is precisely why the Church has money.
The central power of the church has been in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money led many to doubt whether this principle was being adhered to.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off the country from vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated generally accepted international law, codified by several international agreements over the last two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from penetrating entire sea sections, which was a danger even for neutral ships.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After the experience of the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid another such situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take up a position at the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the United States with 4 cents in his possession, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique method of indicating different eras. Every period in China and every family that was in power was its own dynasty.
There were also unstable times of divided provinces between the individual dynasties. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In those times, fierce wars raged among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The time of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the fight for the highest throne in the grand palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a departure from absolutism towards republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not just to one ruler.
After the revolution, all professions were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and best could succeed.
The same applies to the military, because instead of being based on class membership, the army rankings are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things that went beyond this everyday life. He often visited a cave, which became known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (Light), to meditate.
The cave itself has survived the ages and offers a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. Once you are in the cave, you are completely isolated.
You see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Cheops Pyramid is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Cheops Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or the "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the large Sphinx.
The large pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Cheops' wives and family members.
The "swab" symbol looks like a V and the "absorbent" symbol looks like a bracket or a square, with the lower line missing.
Up means you should start at the top and push the bow. Down means you should start at the frog (that's where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Scraping generates a softer sound, while scratching is more powerful and expressive.
You can certainly add your own pencil markings; just remember that the printed fret markings are there for musical reasons, so they should be respected as a rule.
The panicked King Louis XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (the 11-year-old Marie-Therese and the 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris by a mob of market women on October 6, 1789 in Versailles.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming mob of people who hurled threats at the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages wide.
At some point, a member of the angry crowd held up the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the horrified queen's eyes.
The war expenses of the US imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover the bulk of expenses, and the interest from bonds flowed through Wall Street banking houses on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the superprofits, which came from the ongoing exploitation of the Philippine people, were the fundamental gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, an era in European history that spanned the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 CE).
The early Middle Ages preceded the high Middle Ages, followed by the late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological push or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic that is connected to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas. First, that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and second, that technology itself has "impacts" on societies that are more inherent than social in nature.
It can be argued that the development of roads is inevitably linked to the development of passenger cars.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a small number of cars. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The widespread ownership of automobiles also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element, drawing on writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, it was geography that shaped individuals. Over time, customs and cultures emerged that were related to this geography and, because they were in harmony with the place of society, they were better than laws that were arbitrarily imposed.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world today, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined over the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine markets.
At this time, the title of the world's fashion capital also moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th and 14th centuries.
At the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the east.
However, styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind due to slow communication channels.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people began to use buttons to fasten their clothing as a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture that aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic farming method that uses saved, locally adapted seed and combines it with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence farming and in many developing countries, this is still the case.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can differentiate themselves from others in terms of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture as such can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical in nature, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through an unmistakable and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits, and jargon.
One of the most common methods of illustrating the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialized by adults due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse during their childhood.
"Such children are called 'feral' or wild. Some feral children were kept captive by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, the child's neglect was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's significant intellectual or physical limitations."
Wolf children may have experienced severe child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others were raised by animals; some lived alone in the wild.
If it was raised entirely by animals, the wild child exhibits behaviors (within the limits of its physical abilities) that are almost entirely in accord with those of its specific caregiver, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, “scaffolding” goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a tool that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as when using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little office clipboard in Microsoft Office.
Virtual aids are built into the software and are intended to question, suggest, and explain work steps that the student may not be able to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not caring, loving, and education-oriented, but many are forced to.
For us, the system of care accommodation is a piece of security for these children.
Our foster family system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The foster home should cover all the needs that they did not have in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet connects both elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the utility and reward approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are presented as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal commitment" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important insights for the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can tell whether someone is lying by correctly interpreting minimal changes in facial expression.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who have lost the ability to understand language due to brain damage can still accurately assess the honesty of people.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation creates new genetic variations and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools back and forth with each generation.
Out in the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like the human one to meet its amino acid needs from available plant sources.
Moreover, there are serious consequences if you fail to do so: growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
Overall, it should not surprise us that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to how chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Sleep deprivation is the process of waking up during normal sleep periods and falling asleep a short time (10-60 minutes) later.
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you are someone who imagines the alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you are forced to leave the bed to turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option is to drink a lot of liquid before bed (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effect), so that you are forced to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner calm that a person possesses is inversely correlated with the degree of tension in the body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vitality. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded with the path of love of Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
At the center of Tibetan meditation is god yoga. By visualizing various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are opened, and enlightened consciousness is born.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the clash of systems, the course and culture led to the countries becoming enemies.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It should last the next 40 years and in reality, it will be fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already completely collapsed and the only hope was a retreat and a reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans were almost overnight made obsolete, however, as over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts and created them, after they had invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient method for transporting large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that a country remains able to transport people and goods, while simultaneously impeding the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most significant recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans tried to bring manpower and material across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Great Britain just like the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently domesticated in the Zagros Mountains in Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them as livestock to easily obtain their milk, fur, meat, and skin.
House goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas. The goats were tended by goatherds, much like the more familiar sheep herders; often these were children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today.
In the 16th century, they built support tracks in England.
Although the tram tracks were made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses that pulled the wagons to reach higher speeds and pull greater loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
Thresholds were introduced quite early on to secure the position of the rails. However, it was gradually realised that rails that carry a strip of iron are more efficient.
This became common, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. The first completely iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of locomotion was walking. Humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means “upright man”).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as regularly.
Bipedal species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering.
In many cases, this is just like treating the symptoms. However, if you want more than just temporary solutions, we should find and treat the root of the problem.
It is really obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity and that the problems due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people have become more serious.
After its adoption by the Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap a few blocks away.
Over the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are known today as the "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript did not survive the ages.
Many paleontologists now believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still living today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them to be dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many things about birds still look like a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the processing of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
An internal poisoning may not be immediately recognizable. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best sign of poisoning from swallowing can be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Look on the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term "ant" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term is derived from the ancient familiarity with bed bugs. These are insects that are very adaptable in parasitizing humans.
Both bedbugs and cockroaches are nidicol, meaning they are adapted to live in the nests or dwellings of their hosts.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in adults of younger and middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their own best interest or in the best interest of their child to raise a baby.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights, so that another couple can take over parenting.
The main goal of science is to use the scientific method to discover how the world works. This method is indeed the basis of most scientific investigations.
However, it is not just about experimentation, where an experiment is a test that is used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by asking questions and conducting observations.
Scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
With the loss of Greek language knowledge, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often based in large part on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Behaviors determined by a cycle, which are not just reactions to signals from external cycles, are known in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that execute free-swinging cycles for a while even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the significant pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, in which they either tagged the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a wide range of effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material in question, and whether the cells in question are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
One example of this is visiting, photographing and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small provincial towns by car to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose workplace is at the place they have just left.
In this dynamic pendulum traffic, everyone is connected to and supports a transport system based on private cars to some extent.
Science now points out that this massive carbon economy has pulled the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has sustained human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear about as many complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems lead to such problems, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent, or is something more fundamental going on here?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a reasonably consistent manner; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important properties were defined: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of facilities on the roadway.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them to evade enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a wider selection of small hiding places where they can hide from predators.
Today, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarch claimed that the sun was at the center of the movements of the solar system.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), moved around the earth.
That seems reasonable, because it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and the most water-rich river in the world. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes up to six miles wide.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the planet's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon mainstream is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It absorbs water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size or the technical perfection of their construction.
Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were over a thousand years old at the time.
The Vatican City has approximately 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to humans since ancient times, as they can all be found in their original form in nature and can be mined with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This corresponded more to the four states of aggregation (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. However, he also posited the theory that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that billions of them would fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
Accordingly, the pencil became a good friend to many people after its invention.
Unfortunately, the pencil has been pushed into the background with the advent of newer writing methods, so that it has been pushed back in its status and in its use.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens without ever having to get near a typewriter.
We can look forward to what the keyboard will become when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that energy is needed to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a heavy car up a hill. When the core splits again, some of this energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they disintegrate at the slightest or no stimulus at all.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the sea and thicker under the highlands.
On the near side, there could be more Maria because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what moves or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized over the course of their adulthood.
These theories deal with what causes certain people to want exactly the things they do, and what influences in their environment cause them to do certain things or not to do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of the hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when managers start to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain “one of the guys” (or one of the girls).
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable individual who has to do everything differently than the team did and take everything for yourself.
Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are managed to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones that may not be considered by local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"The 'invisible team' is the leadership team, to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member."
Why would an organization take on the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organization? A goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized across all departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the collective work of an organization in overcoming an obstacle can lead to a new innovative method to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must develop a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum concept as a method to help organizations become more efficient.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus defining and refining the field of research.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain damage, such as trauma, injury, and tumors, affect behavior and cause changes in some brain functions.
Emerging technologies are enabling us to see and study certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our head.
Although strongly associated with science fiction, AI is an important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of AI includes the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include control, setting up strategies and timetables, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become independent disciplines, focusing on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now frequently used in the fields of business, medicine, engineering, and the military, and has also been incorporated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every school class. Not infrequently, a teacher would like to take her or his students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Virtual excursions are a technical solution. Students can view museum pieces from their classroom, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital every year. The website is rebuilt every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help to improve students' writing skills. Although students often have sloppy grammar and spelling at the beginning of their blogging experience, this usually changes when there is an audience.
Since students are often a very critical audience, the blog author tries to improve his writing style to avoid criticism.
Blogging "also forces students to learn more about the world around them." The need to engage the audience inspires students to write wisely and interestingly (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs “can enable students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of other texts and articulate their own perspectives on certain topics” (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and is home to a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north, the unspoiled beauty of nature spreads out in Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more make Ontario what outsiders consider to be typical Canadian.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the US than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, in terms of wildlife, a continent of its own.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or belong to France and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and it was very successful in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese sailor Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel zone and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers claim to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (just not one that looks too expensive.
Women should recognize that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider an assault, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Stay consistent when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to defend your position (cultural differences aside; that doesn't mean it's okay!)
The present-day Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el Beida and it was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes, and a whole range of tinnef are sold, but that is all just for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, particularly the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any stay outside of Goma should be carefully planned to learn about the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the cheapest gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
You can use bodabodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around in Goma. The usual (local) price is around 500 Congolese Francs for the short ride.
This, combined with its relative inaccessibility, has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, far-off countries.
Although Timbuktu is known for its reputation as a tourist attraction and has an airport, it is now a impoverished city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered world cultural heritage sites due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the most important stops on Louis Gates PBS special "Wonders of the African World".
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the cities in the country, because it has more of an Arabic than an African flair.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa. It borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different animal world.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park charges daily conservation and entry fees.
It may also be worth buying a Wild Card, which grants access to either selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the namesake of the territory of Hong Kong and is the focus of many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline were compared to a sparkling bar chart, visible through the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and head to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed on newly reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers made their own. If you are looking for traces of the area's colonial past, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove belt in the world and extend over 80 km from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland to the coast.
The Sundarbans were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that is within the Indian state is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps, however – they also include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which a third is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans have been a nature reserve since 1966, and according to estimates, there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer there.
Buses run all day from the district-wide bus station (on the other side of the river), with most buses, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, leaving between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the buses between the districts are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Shuttle buses offer a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers are 83 meters high, its length is 378 meters and it has two lanes with a width of 3.50 meters.
The clearance height under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction work was completed in August 2011, but the road was not opened until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to fully resume operations in September 2017, with the Brazilian customs checkpoints expected to be completed by then.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group that inhabited present-day eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the Great Province of the West Indies, was created in the 16th century as a result of the meeting of the Spanish conquerors with the indigenous native groups.
The Spaniards began the colonization period, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having the best polo team and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be watched at other times of the year.
Information on competitions and sales points for polo tickets can be found at the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is set in line with the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West Store.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and with Stanley credit cards. US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards are probably not accepted on the remote islands, although British and US currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to find out which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside of the islands themselves, so you should exchange the money before leaving the island.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. Temperatures above +30 °C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cool: Temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct rainy or dry seasons: The amount of precipitation remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to the sight of people, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authority, visitors should keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful bison, elk, bears and practically all large animals may appear, it can still happen that they attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep enough distance. These animals are big, wild and possibly dangerous, so give them enough space.
Also, be aware that smells can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strongly scented foods and keep a clean camp.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of an ignominious standoff between the navy in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships except for a British cruiser were sunk. Almost 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the Mau Movement's campaign for independence, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of the chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Since Auckland stretches over two harbours, there are many beaches. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe swimming and most offer shade, provided by Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches that are sometimes overcrowded, with a beautiful shopping promenade along the coast. Swimming is safe here.
The most important local beer is “Number One”. It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called “Manta”.
There are many French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines are perhaps more palatable.
The local tap water is safe to drink, but if you are concerned, you can easily find bottled water.
"For Australians, the idea of a coffee is foreign. A small black coffee is an espresso, cappuccino is made with a lot of foam (not froth) and tea is served without milk."
The hot chocolate is of Belgian standard. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many diving trips take place throughout the year and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
However, you should follow the advice of authorities, pay attention to all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Jellyfish occur near the beach and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally occur outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the sea, their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
A reservation in advance gives the traveler the assurance that he will have a place to stay upon arrival at his destination.
Travel agencies often have arrangements with specific hotels, although you may also be able to book other types of accommodation, such as camping sites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport to and from the airport, or even a combination of flight and hotel.
They can also hold your reservation for you if you need time to reconsider your offer or to obtain additional documents for your travel destination (e.g. visas).
However, any changes or inquiries should be directed to the travel agency first, not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of festival-goers choose to camp on site, and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to go early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that music will be played late into the night on parts of the festival, even after the music on the main stages has stopped.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as the breaking of ice causes quite horrible noise for those most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg also offer time for a stay in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to keep guests on site for as long as possible and get them to spend a lot of money. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits can be hard to find.
They usually have a special offer of food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests happy and to make sure they stay.
Some venues offer free alcoholic drinks, but intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Those who want to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes should expect snow, ice and temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, the grip is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
In snowstorms, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you can get stuck.
The visibility can also be affected by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
In common usage, the term safari refers to a land journey to observe the overwhelming African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and the standard equipment allows for a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are often shy and you can observe them better with binoculars.
A foot safari (also called a bushwalk, trekking safari or footing) is a hike that lasts either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Olympic Summer Games, after it already hosted the games in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March, most cancellation policies were not in effect until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is estimated that most tickets for the event will cost between 2,500¥ and 130,000¥, with an average ticket costing around 7,000¥.
Ironing damp clothes can help dry them. Many hotels provide irons and ironing boards, even if you are not in the room.
If an iron is not available or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (this can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, cause burns).
There are various methods for purifying water. Some of them are more effective in counteracting certain dangers.
In some areas, it is sufficient to boil water for one minute, in others it must be several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies greatly, and if you have concerns, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter pests that they are not familiar with from their home regions.
Pests can destroy food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, even trigger allergic reactions, administer poison or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases as such or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with violence are usually not classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and consumption taxes in certain places.
Travellers whose destination country has high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, particularly on products such as alcoholic drinks and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway is probably the biggest driving challenge, as it often leads through remote, uninhabited terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, stay alert: steep slopes, narrow roads and sharp curves predominate here.
The speed limits given are noticeably lower than in the previous and following sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict adherence is even more important than usual.
Interestingly, however, the cell phone coverage here is much better than in many other areas of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are quite tasty. In Bavaria they are quite nutritious and varied, as are those of our southern neighbour Austria.
Fruit pastry is widespread, with apples being cooked into pastry all year round and cherries and plums being used in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts or other nuts. Popular cakes often go particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to make small but rich pastries, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
Depending on the amount of liquid, a curry can be either "dry" or "wet".
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is usually used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is usually used.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when the term is used without further attributes, it usually refers to the food that originally came from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is now widespread throughout the island group, offers a variety of simply spiced dishes. The Javanese prefer to use peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut flower sugar) and a range of aromatic spices as flavor carriers.
Martingales are aids for the rider's feet, which hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They give the rider more stability, but there are safety concerns because the rider's feet could get caught in them.
If a rider falls off a horse and gets caught on the stirrup, they can be dragged along if the horse runs through. To keep this risk as low as possible, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a flat, fairly narrow sole.
In addition, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety stirrups that allow a stirrup strap to fall from the saddle as soon as it is pulled back by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley – Chile’s most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite National Park of South America, with a multitude of large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks offer a breathtaking view. Climbers from all over the world discover new routes along the walls, which offer endless possibilities.
Downhill sports such as skiing and snowboarding are popular sports in which skis or a snowboard are attached to your feet and you slide down a slope covered in snow.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums", who plan their entire holiday around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings with depictions of skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The origins of skiing as a sport date back at least to the 17th century and the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians in 1861.
Ski hiking with a backpack: This activity is also called ski touring or ski hiking.
It is similar to alpine touring skiing or mountaineering, but does not necessarily include it, as the latter is performed in steep terrain and requires much firmer skis and boots.
Consider the ski route as a comparable hiking route.
In good conditions, you are able to cover slightly greater distances than when hiking – only very rarely will you achieve the speed of cross-country skiing on well-maintained trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has numerous independent countries. Normally, one would have to apply for multiple visas and go through several passport checks if one wanted to travel through several countries.
However, the Schengen area works a bit like a country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Accordingly, you do not need to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen member states individually, which saves time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes an antique, and some tax authorities define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition shows geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handmade products could be described as "antique", even though they are younger than similar products from mass production.
Reindeer husbandry is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many who work in other professions.
In the past, not all Sámi have raised reindeer on a large scale, but have lived off fishing, hunting and the like. They mainly kept reindeer as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
"Even if the term 'gypsy' is used mainly by non-Roma, it is often perceived as offensive, as it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma."
If a travel advisory is issued for the country you will be visiting, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the advice of other governments other than your own. However, their advice is tailored to their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may be confronted with different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Reports are just a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general and too simplified in comparison to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
A storm is the collective term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, severe social disruption or loss of life.
Storms can occur anywhere in the world and there are various types of them, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and forest fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, flash floods, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travellers are urged to pay attention to any kind of weather that affects their area, as this can affect all travel plans.
Anyone planning to travel to a country that is considered a war zone should undergo professional training for it.
"A search on the Internet for "Course on hostile environments" will probably show the address of a local company."
A course usually covers all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course is usually between 2 and 5 days long and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are numerous books and journals on survival in the wilderness, but few publications on war zones.
Travelers planning to undergo gender-affirming surgery abroad must ensure they have valid identification documents for their return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with unspecified gender (X) or documents that have been updated to reflect the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents is also very different.
The searches at security checks have also become much more intrusive since September 11, 2001.
Transgender people before their surgery should not expect their privacy and dignity to be intact when passing through the scanners.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves that break on the beach, often at reefs or the like.
Due to the underwater topography, the backflow concentrates in a few deeper areas and a fast current can form there, down to deep water.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion while trying to swim against the current, which can prove impossible.
When you get out of the current, swimming back is not more difficult than normal.
Try to get somewhere where you won't be caught again. Alternatively, depending on your abilities and whether you have been noticed, you might want to wait for rescue.
The return shock comes earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is not as pronounced), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travelers who find it easy to adapt to new cultures sometimes find it particularly difficult to adjust to their own culture.
When you come back home after a stay abroad, you have adapted to a different culture and have dropped some of the habits of your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travelers have to adjust to a new country.
One might not expect that patience and understanding are also required for returning travelers.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness and while it is quiet, before the show begins.
Normally, you can always hear the sounds of tourists and vendors. The history of the sounds and the light is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as a background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are depicted on the pyramids, with the various pyramids being illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most stations. In 2020, sixteen were active.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworthland is the region south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here merge into the plateau and then rise again to form the 360 km long chain of Ellsworth Mountains, which is divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is Mount Vinson at 4892 m.
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outside and in line of sight of a satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that require data and voice connections.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide further information on connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for people planning to take a year off is studying and taking courses abroad.
This is very popular among school graduates, as it allows them to take a year off before university without it affecting their studies.
In many cases, participation in an overseas gap year program can actually improve your chances of pursuing higher education in your home country.
As a rule, a tuition fee is charged for enrollment in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boating tours. The “land of a thousand lakes” also has thousands of islands – in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht for the archipelagoes and lakes.
Even if the coastal island groups and the largest lakes are actually large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national leisure activity in Finland, with one in six or eight people owning a boat.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one to forty).
Most pure Baltic Sea cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for several whole days, while returning to the ship to sleep at night.
If you only go ashore during the boat excursions, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises advertise Berlin, Germany as a destination in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and from all walks of life, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is nothing more than the personal fears and antipathies that many people have.
Learning more about how airplanes work and the procedures during a flight can help some people overcome the fear associated with the unknown or the feeling of not having control.
Courier companies are well paid for the fast delivery of things. Often, time is a very important factor in business documents, commercial goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies use their own planes, but on other routes and with smaller companies, difficulties arose.
When they sent things by air freight, the unloading and customs clearance on some routes could take several days.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as unaccompanied baggage. Airlines' regulations do not allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious method of flying first or business class is to throw a lot of money at the privilege (or, even better, get your own company to pay for it).
However, this is not cheap: As a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class and up to eleven times for first class!
In general, it is pointless to look for discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of flyers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably and demand corresponding prices.
The capital of Moldova is Kishinau. The local language is Romanian, but many people also speak Russian.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of the Republic of Moldova could be restored.
The most important religion in Moldova is Christian Orthodoxy.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.
The once ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, progressive and busy business center, located on a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glazed buildings and modern shopping centers are characterized by classic red tile roofs, the 18th century market, as well as old mosques and churches, although the city exudes more of an atmosphere of Mediterranean Europe than that of traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
There are some interesting marble sculptures of doves on some of the graves in the cemetery.
It is worth taking a half-hour stroll through the fascinating village.
To the north and in the immediate vicinity is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after Lord Byron described its splendor in bright colors.
The Scotturb bus 403 regularly runs from Cabo da Roca to Sintra.
In the north, visit the great sanctuary of Our Lady of the Rosary of Fatima (pilgrimage site) – a place that is world-famous for its Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave site and a place that is of almost immeasurable importance to a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived their time here, and many more with relatives who were murdered there or worked to death, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this site with the dignity, reverence, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site by applying or scratching graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the residents prefer Catalan, the vast majority understands it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as it is legally established as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely spoken in public transport and other facilities.
Normal announcements on the metro are made exclusively in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are reported by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are said to be self-centered, rude and arrogant.
Even if this is often just an inaccurate cliché, one is best off in Paris if one shows their best side and behaves like someone who is “bien élevé” (well-bred). This will make it much easier to get along.
The brash exterior of the Parisians disappears very quickly when you show basic manners.
The Plitvice National Park is heavily forested, with mainly beech, fir and pine trees, and offers a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to its numerous microclimates, different soils and alternating altitudes, it has a remarkably large variety of plant communities.
The area is also home to an extremely large variety of animal and bird species.
There are rare fauna such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wild cats and capercaillie, as well as many species that are generally more common.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that reach above the knee and also cover their shoulders.
In most monasteries, there are robes for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will give you a smile.
Similarly, men must wear pants that reach above the knee.
These can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but the clothing is not washed after each user, so you may not feel comfortable in these skirts. There is a one-size-fits-all for all men!
The Mallorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and always uses olive oil.
A simple popular evening meal, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available ingredients such as cheese, tuna etc.
"All nouns, next to the word you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence."
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It probably also makes reading easier, but writing is somewhat difficult because you have to determine whether a verb or adjective is being used as the main word.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
"Also, pay attention to pronouncing r and rr differently: caro means "love", whereas carro means "chariot".
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introductory grammar would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
If you speak a Romance language, it is of course easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak some Spanish might be quick to conclude that Portuguese is so similar that it doesn't need to be learned separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually no longer in operation today and serve as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution was not the problem it is today during its peak, they are usually located in cities or on university campuses, which are easier to access than those built in recent times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Watching cherry blossoms, known as Hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where peach blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor for himself and other members of the nobility in the vicinity of the imperial court.
"Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove just one."
If you visit a formally laid out garden and collect "samples", you will also be thrown out without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place where you can find your way around easily and buy almost everything after arrival.
As you are in the extreme tropics and only a few degrees north of the equator, you must expect both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
There are also a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives.
Make sure the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good basis for holiday planning.
For example, castle tours in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also represent popular hiking and cycling routes.
In Christianity, Christmas is one of the most important holidays and is considered the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions around the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night at some open spot to see the sunrise.
There are of course Christian-theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday evening, during the Easter weekend, with the celebrations of the communities often starting at midnight, celebrating the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands either swam, flew or were washed ashore.
Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals were not able to make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the main prey on the Galapagos Islands.
Since the first humans set foot on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky is more or less dark around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you can also enjoy the starry sky.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
Suits are part of the standard business attire and colleagues address each other by their family names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is of crucial importance, with the focus being more on group performance than on praise for individual achievements.
Often, employees must seek the approval of their superiors for all decisions they make, and they are expected to follow their bosses' instructions unconditionally.
