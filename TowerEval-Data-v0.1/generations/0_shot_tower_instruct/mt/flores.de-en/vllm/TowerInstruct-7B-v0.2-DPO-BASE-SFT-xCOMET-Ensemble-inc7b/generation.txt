This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely accepted, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on the upper side and light or carotenoid-colored on the underside.
The find also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft, called the rachis, but do possess other features of feathers - barbs and barbules - the researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suspected that the sample, although it was the tail of a young dinosaur, showed the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chick.
The researchers claimed that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the plumage of an adult and not that of a juvenile.
A car bomb detonated in the morning of the previous day in the police headquarters of the Turkish Gaziantep, killing two policemen and injuring over twenty other people.
According to the Governor's office, 19 of the injured are police officers.
Police said they suspected a militant supporter of Daesh (ISIL) was behind the attack.
They found that the sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: It was discovered that the activity of all stars in the system is driven by their luminosity, rotation and nothing else.
To determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow, the luminosity and the rotation are taken into account together.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of reversals of the magnetic field.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon attracts the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way exerts gravitational forces on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists concluded that dark matter acts on other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter is located in a type of halo around a galaxy and is made up of many small particles.

“They are colder during the day than the surrounding surface and warmer at night.”
"Their thermal behavior is not as uniform as that of large caves on Earth, which often have a fairly constant temperature, but it does agree that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the astrogeology team at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a pre-printed slip of paper, on which the candidate of their choice is written, into an envelope.
After the officials have confirmed the identity of the voter, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law sets out the procedure quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that no envelopes are present at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those of the properly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process, and on the evening the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to special procedures.

Four skiers from Krückenskifahrens did not make it to the finish line, and 45 of the total 117 skiers in the giant slalom were unable to place in the race.
The police of Madhya Pradesh have found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and seized her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanja, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car crashed in, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
As a result, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has in the meantime been charged with the murder of her son at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in custody pending charges and trial, but witness statements could be tainted because her image has been widely publicized.
This is standard practice elsewhere in Britain, but the Scottish justice system works differently and the courts have deemed publication of the photos as potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes: "Journalists seem to be crossing a dangerous line when they publish photos etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is leading the prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made until at least the indictment.
According to the leak, the document refers to the border dispute in which the Palestinians demand a return to the borders before the Six-Day War of 1967.
Other topics that are supposedly covered include the future of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding a military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, whereas the Palestinian Authority, on the other hand, wants to accept such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the accompanying trial to control the plague should be closely supervised by handlers, as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of Park Conservation and Heritage in the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunt were given comprehensive safety and training.
Martelly yesterday swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) with nine members.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP within four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The trigger for the sometimes violent protests was the failure to hold elections, some of which have been pending since 2011.
Over 60 cases of overheating have been reported in defective iPods, resulting in six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been notified of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week METI announced it had been informed by Apple of a further 34 cases of overheating, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded by describing Apple's delay of the report as "really regrettable."
The earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas Office of Homeland Security said no damage had been reported in the territory.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and there are currently at least six confirmed deaths.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the place of an elderly lady when she needed to use the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature labor in his free time.
His research showed that the use of a hormone accelerated the lung maturation of the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday retrieved two "black box" flight recorders.
Wrestling colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Very unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented: "Luna was just as crazy as I am... maybe even crazier... I love her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed ahead of the 2010 federal election, the proportion of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 per cent since 2008.
The then acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared during the 2010 federal election campaign that in her opinion Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
Twenty-nine percent of those surveyed said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games but his fitness has been called into question due to a series of ailments.
He was unable to take the required medication to manage his pain as it is banned at the Commonwealth Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Numerous people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for the Earth, along with organic matter that can form proteins and enable life.
As comets collided with the Earth long ago, scientists hope to gain insights into how planets, particularly the Earth, came to be.
Cuomo (53) took up his governorship earlier this year and last month signed a bill to legalise same-sex marriage.
He described the rumours as "political nonsense and foolishness".
It is speculated that he could run for the office of president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, while reducing carbon emissions.
It relies on satellite-based technology instead of older ground radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to more precisely locate planes and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being put in place and overground trains will not be stopping at Wembley. There are no on-site car parks or park and ride facilities.
With concerns over lack of transport growing, the likelihood increased that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had developed within just two generations, although it was previously thought that this process would take much longer due to mating between a native Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the introduced cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into a wide variety of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued onto other metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images, called illuminated manuscripts, in books, which are called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can produce an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes its color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemicals being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then shape them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels weird and forms a kind of protective layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, which was connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems were found in the houses of Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Even in ancient Egypt, Persia and China, there were toilets. In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, which men and women visited in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it almost immediately back down.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and our view a little.
It takes a giant rocket, more than 100 feet tall, to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest service the wheel has provided us is much easier and faster transportation.
It has brought us the railway, the car and many other means of transport.
Among them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats that roam free) that eat much smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche, a special task that each cat has and that ensures that they do not compete with each other.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups called prides.
The groups consist of one to three related adult males as well as up to thirty females and young.
Women usually have a close relationship with each other when they live in a big family with sisters and daughters.
Lion prides act in a similar way to wolf or dog packs, animals that surprisingly resemble lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior and are just as deadly towards their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (albeit not particularly well), swim, jump long distances and pull with five times the force of a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars, the only four cats that can roar.
The roar of the tiger doesn't sound like the full-throated roar of the lion, but more like a sentence made up of grumbly growled words.
Ocelots eat small animals. If they can, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
Scientists think that ocelots track and locate their prey with their sense of smell, sniffing where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and move unnoticed. Ozelots hunt their prey by optically matching themselves to their surroundings and then attacking their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population it came from (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island so it can't easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different features or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what it needed before.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, and then it looks less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, two populations can look so different that they can no longer be assigned to the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants generate the oxygen that humans breathe in, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., breathe out).
Plants produce their food through photosynthesis using the sun, and they also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. We mainly feed on plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other Mosasauruses.
Its long jaws were equipped with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, in addition to another set in the palate, which meant that there was no escape for any animal that crossed its path.
We're not sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. It fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and may even have been a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that came into the water; even a large dinosaur like the T. Rex was no match for him.
While we are all familiar with much of their diet, the Romans did have their share of strange or unusual feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a type of rodent called a seven-toed hedgehog.
Another difference was that poor people and women ate their meals while sitting on chairs, while wealthy men preferred to hold joint banquets where they lay on their sides while eating their meals.
Dishes of ancient Rome could not contain foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no maize, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
Offerings were brought to the gods and the priests tried to comply with the will of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner altar room, which could only be entered by priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses did not hold such great significance.
The majority of the Hebrew family's life took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard. Shops simply consisted of shop windows facing the street. Stone was used for building houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. According to the old Norse sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder. When he continued his journey westward, he found Greenland and gave it its name.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although all the countries were "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "The Da Vinci Code," you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That is not true, however. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The words "original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776" were written on the back of the Declaration, upside down on the bottom of the document.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches x 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage at the beginning of its life.
It is therefore possible that the remark was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landing and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
"He was dominated by the 'Vichy' French. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were working with the conquerors, rather than fighting them."
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
After only two weeks, the Americans and the French liberation troops had liberated the south of France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and which also somehow defines the size of a society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and appropriate dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as legitimate civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the 13 states formed a weak central government based on the Articles of Confederation, consisting only of the Congress.
The Congress was not empowered to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities to enforce all of its laws, which often did not cooperate.
He also had no authority to suspend tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous agreement of all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so little seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful in the world, alongside the German national football team, and was the 2006 FIFA World Champion.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions and Italians participate in international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan possesses nearly 7,000 islands (with Honshu being the largest), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
"Due to the cluster/group of islands, Japan is, and often is geographically referred to as, an ""archipelago""."
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed by and documented the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a settlement in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a change in the grain cultivation methods of the indigenous people and employing Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the government of the Qing Dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it relinquished sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists mainly of three structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most widely used image format worldwide is 35 mm, which corresponds to the predominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its image format has been adopted by digital camera image sensor formats.
To be precise, the so-called 35 mm format measures, confusingly, 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore referred to as 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) have the same or a very similar aspect ratio.
The oft-maligned and often-ridiculed thirds rule is a simple guideline that creates dynamic and, at the same time, maintains a sense of order in an image.
It states that the point of intersection of the lines that divide an image into thirds vertically and horizontally is the most effective place for the main subject (see example).
During this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had held the European states together despite different languages and customs.
His omnipotence controlled everyone, from the king to the common citizen.
One of the key tenets of Christian faith is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that is precisely why the Church has the funds it does.
The central power of the church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money led many to doubt whether this principle was being adhered to.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off the country from vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law, codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from advancing into entire sections of the sea, which was a danger even for neutral ships.
As the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted U-boat warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After experiencing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take up a position with the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the USA with 4 cents in his possession, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique method of indicating different ages. Each period of time in China and each family that was in power was its own dynasty.
There were also unstable periods of divided provinces between the different dynasties. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In those times, bitter wars raged among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The time of the three kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying in the fight for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a move away from absolutism towards republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the land belongs to the people and not just to one ruler.
After the revolution, all professions were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and best-qualified could succeed.
The same applies to the military, because instead of being based on class, army rankings are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was very interested in things beyond everyday life. He often visited a cave, which became known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (Light), to meditate.
The cave itself has survived the ages and offers a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists, and once you are inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
You see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Cheops Pyramid is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Cheops Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or the "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples as well as the great Sphinx.
The large pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Cheops' wives and family members.
The "swab" symbol looks like a V, and the "no swab" symbol like a bracket or a square with a missing bottom line.
Upwards means you should start at the top and push the bow. Downwards means you should start at the frog (that's where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Applying the brush in a downward motion usually generates a softer sound, while applying it in an upward motion is more powerful and expressive.
You are welcome to add your own pencil markings; however, remember that the printed sheet markings are there for musical reasons, and should normally be respected.
In a state of panic, King Louis the XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) as well as the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced by a mob of market women to return to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They travelled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming mob of people who hurled threats at the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages wide.
At one point, a member of the angry crowd held up the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the horrified queen.
The war expenses of the US imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover the bulk of expenses, and the interest from bonds flowed through Wall Street banking houses in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the superprofits that came from the ongoing exploitation of the Philippine people were the basic gains of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history that spanned the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 CE).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which all ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a broad range of ideas in practice, from the technology push or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic that is associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: firstly, that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and secondly, that technology itself has "impacts" on societies that are more inherent than socially determined.
It can be argued, for example, that the development of roads is inevitably linked to the production of passenger cars.
However, a nationwide road network for only a small number of cars is not economically viable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The widespread ownership of automobiles also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element, drawing on writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, it is geography that shaped individuals. Over time, customs and cultures emerged in relation to this geography and, as they were in harmony with the place of society, they were better than laws arbitrarily imposed.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world today, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, largely because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine markets.
At that time, the title of the fashion capital of the world also moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th-11th and the 14th centuries.
At the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the east.
However, styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind due to slow communication channels.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture that aims to produce just enough food to cover the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic method of farming that uses saved, locally adapted seed and combines it with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries, this is still the case.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differentiate themselves from others in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as such can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical in nature, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through an unmistakable and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits, and jargon.
One of the most common methods of illustrating the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune or intentional abuse during their childhood, were not socialized by adults.
"Such children are called 'feral' or wild. Some feral children were kept captive by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, the child's neglect was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's significant intellectual or physical disabilities."
Wolf children may have experienced severe child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are believed to have been raised by animals; some are thought to have lived alone in the wild.
If it was raised entirely by animals, the feral child will exhibit behaviors (within the limits of its physical abilities) that are almost entirely in line with those of its specific caretaker, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, "scaffolding" goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather an aid that supports individuals in a novel learning situation, such as when using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Frameworks can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of framework, but so is the little clip art man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistance is built into the software and is intended to question, suggest and explain work steps that the student may not be able to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to coercion.
No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not caring, loving and education-oriented, but many are.
For us, the system of care accommodation is a source of security for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The foster home is meant to cover all the needs that they did not have in the home from which they were taken.
The internet connects elements of mass communication as well as interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the benefit and reward approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are presented as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important insights for the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting minimal changes in facial expression.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who have lost the ability to understand language due to brain damage can still correctly assess the honesty of others.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals like domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation creates new genetic variations and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools back and forth with each generation.
Out in the savannah, it's tough for a primate with a digestive system like ours to get enough amino acids from available plant sources.
Moreover, there are serious consequences if you neglect it: growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
Overall, it should not surprise us that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to how chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Sleep fragmentation is the process of being purposefully awakened during normal sleep periods and falling asleep a short time (10-60 minutes) later.
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you're someone who sets the alarm while asleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you're forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option is to drink a lot of liquid (particularly water or tea, known for its diuretic effect) before bed, so that you are forced to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner calm a person possesses correlates inversely with the degree of tension in body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force is. Every person has the potential to find absolute calm and contentment.
Anyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded with the path of love of Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is god yoga. By visualizing various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are opened, and enlightened consciousness arises.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the clash of systems, the course of events, and the culture led to the countries becoming enemies.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last the next 40 years and, in reality, it would be fought out by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence had already completely collapsed and the only hope was a retreat and a reorganisation along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans were rendered almost obsolete overnight, however, as over 800,000 Red Army soldiers of the Soviet Union poured into the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts, creating them after they had invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient method for transporting large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure a country remains able to move people and goods, while simultaneously impeding an enemy's ability to do so.
One of the most significant recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in the Second World War, when the Americans tried to bring manpower and material across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain just like the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran as early as about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them as livestock in order to easily obtain their milk, fur, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed on hills or other grazing areas. The goats were tended by goatherds, much like the more familiar shepherds; often these were children or adolescents. This grazing method is still used today.
As early as the 16th century, they built support tracks in England.
Although the tramways consisted of only parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses that pulled the wagons to reach higher speeds and pull greater loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
Thresholds were introduced quite early on to secure the position of the rails, but gradually the realisation set in that rails carrying a strip of iron are more efficient.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first completely iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking. Two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo erectus (which means "upright man"), humans began to walk upright.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as regularly.
Bipedal species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering.
In many cases, this is just like treating the symptoms. However, if you want more than just temporary solutions, we should find and treat the root of the problem.
It is really obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity and that the problems caused by overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people have become more serious.
After its passage by the Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by the President of the Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
Over the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are known today as the "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document; the original manuscript did not survive the ages.
Many paleontologists today believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still living today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them to be dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many things about birds still look like they did in the days of the dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the processing of information that is coded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, with symptoms such as vomiting so general that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best sign of poisoning from swallowing may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Look on the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term is derived from the ancient familiarity with bed bugs. These are insects that are very adaptable in their ability to parasitize humans.
Both bed bugs and cockroaches are nidicolous, meaning they are adapted to live in the nests or dwellings of their hosts.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in adults of younger and middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their own best interest or in the best interest of their child to raise a baby.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take over parenting.
The main goal of science is to use the scientific method to figure out how the world works. This method is indeed the foundation of most scientific investigations.
However, it is not just about experimentation, where an experiment is a test designed to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by asking questions and conducting observations.
Scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, with a particular emphasis on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were widely accepted.
With the loss of knowledge of the Greek language, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often largely based on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Behaviors determined by a cycle, which are not only reactions to signals from external cycles, are known in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that execute free-swinging cycles for a time even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, in which they either labelled the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have a wide range of effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the cells in question are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small towns in cars to go to work and are passed by others whose workplace is where they have just left.
In this dynamic pendulum of transport, everyone is connected in some way to a transport system based on private cars, and supports it.
Science now points out that this massive carbon economy has pulled the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has underpinned human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems lead to such problems, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent, or is something more fundamental at play here?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a somewhat consistent way; therefore, traffic flows have a certain constancy and can be roughly represented mathematically.
In order to better represent the traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important properties were defined: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design and operation of facilities on the highway.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them to evade enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings back along their bodies.
As a result, they have a wider selection of small hiding places where they can hide from predators.
Today, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the sun was at the center of the movements of the solar system.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the Earth.
That seems reasonable, as it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second-longest and the most water-rich river on Earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second-largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, in some places up to six miles wide.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans via the planet's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and takes in water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size or the technical perfection of their construction.
Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were over a thousand years old at the time.
Vatican City has approximately 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language of most who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to humans since ancient times, as they can all be found in their original form in nature and can be extracted using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, put forth the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This corresponded more to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma. However, he also put forward the theory that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that billions of them would fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
As a result, the pencil became a good friend to many people after its invention.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the pencil has been pushed into the background, relegating it to a lesser status and use.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens without ever having to get near a typewriter.
It will be interesting to see what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that energy is required to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's a bit like rolling a heavy car up a hill - when the core splits again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they disintegrate at the slightest or no provocation at all.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the sea and thicker under the highlands.
On the near side there could be more Maria, as the crust is thinner, making it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
In terms of content, theories focus on finding what moves or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized over the course of their development into adulthood.
These theories deal with what motivates certain people to want exactly the things they do, and what influences in their environment cause them to do certain things or not to do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when managers start to lead their former colleagues: one end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or one of the girls).
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, enforcing discipline, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable individual who has to do everything differently than the team has done and take everything for yourself.
Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are managed to the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams may meet across different time zones that the local leadership may not account for.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"The 'invisible team' is the leadership team, to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member."
Why would an organization take on the time-consuming process of implementing a learning organization? A goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized across all departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the collaborative work of an organization in overcoming an obstacle can lead to a new innovative method to address customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must develop a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum concept as a method to help organizations become more effective.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus defining and refining the field of research.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, such as trauma, injury and tumors, affect behavior and cause changes in some brain functions.
Emerging technologies are allowing us to see and study certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
It provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our head.
Although strongly associated with science fiction, AI is an important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of AI involves the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include control, the establishment of strategies and timelines, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become their own disciplines, focused on finding solutions to real-life problems.
Today, AI systems are frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and have also been incorporated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every school class. Not infrequently, a teacher would like to take her or his students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Virtual excursions represent a technical solution. Students can view museum pieces, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art from their classroom.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned each year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. While students often have sloppy grammar and spelling at the beginning of their blogging experience, this usually changes when there is an audience.
As students are often a very critical audience, the blogger makes an effort to improve his writing style in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging "also forces students to learn more about the world around them." The need to engage the audience inspires students to write intelligently and interestingly (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of the texts of others and articulate their own perspectives on particular topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and is home to a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north the unspoiled beauty of nature stretches out in Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more make Ontario what outsiders consider to be quintessentially Canadian.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that may surprise many: there are more African Americans living in the USA than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, in terms of animal life, a continent of its own.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or belong to France and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and it was very successful on the Comoros and in Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel zone and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travellers claim to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (just not one that looks too expensive.
Women should recognise that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider an assault, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm etc.
Stay consistent when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences aside; that still doesn't make it okay!)
The present-day Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids under the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el Beida and it was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of tanneries are sold, but that is all just for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, particularly the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any stay outside of Goma should be carefully planned to account for the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The town is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as for some of the cheapest gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
You can use bodabodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for the short ride.
This, in combination with its relative inaccessibility, has led to "Timbuktu" becoming a metaphor for exotic, far-off countries.
Although Timbuktu is known for its reputation as a tourist attraction and has an airport, it is a deprived city today.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the key locations for Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World."
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, because it has more of an Arabic than an African feel.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa. It borders on Mozambique to the east, on Zimbabwe to the north, and on the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different animal world.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park charges daily conservation and entrance fees.
It may also be worth buying a Wild Card, which grants access to either selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the namesake of the territory of Hong Kong and is the focus of many tourists.
The buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline were compared to a glittering bar chart, visible through the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and head to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers made their own. If you are looking for traces of the area's colonial past, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world and extend over 80 km from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland to the coast.
The Sundarbans were declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest that lies within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they also include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which a third is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans have been a nature reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer living there.
Buses run all day from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river), with most buses, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leaving between 06:30 and 07:30.
As the buses between the districts are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are serviced by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Shared taxis offer a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers are 83 metres high, it is 378 metres long and has two lanes, each 3.50 metres wide.
The clearance height under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction work was completed in August 2011, but the road was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to begin full operations in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group to inhabit present-day eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the Great Province of the West Indies, was created in the 16th century as a result of the meeting of Spanish conquerors and indigenous local groups.
The Spanish began the colonization period, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be viewed at other times of the year.
Information on competitions and sales outlets for polo tickets can be found at the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is fixed in line with the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West Store.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and with Stanley credit cards. US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the more remote islands, although British and US currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to find out which payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside of the islands themselves, so you should exchange the money before leaving the island.
As Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. Temperatures above +30 °C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cool: Temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct rainy or dry seasons: the amount of precipitation remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to instructions from the park authority, visitors should keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful bison, wapitis, elks, bears and practically all large animals may seem, it can happen that they attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year for not keeping enough distance, these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them enough space.
Also, be aware that smells can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling foods and keep a clean campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1750s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of an ignominious standoff with the Navy in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships, with the exception of a British cruiser, were sunk. Almost 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the Mau movement's campaign for independence, a peaceful gathering in the town led to the killing of the paramount chief, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
As Auckland spans two harbours, there are many beaches. The most popular beaches are in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe swimming and most offer shade, provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches that can get crowded, with a nice shopping promenade along the coast. Swimming is safe here.
The most important local beer is "Number One". It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines are perhaps more palatable.
The local tap water can be drunk without hesitation, but if you are concerned, you can also easily find bottled water.
"For Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign. A small espresso is an espresso, a cappuccino is topped high with foam (not froth) and tea is served without milk."
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many reef dives take place throughout the year and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
However, you should follow the advice of authorities, pay attention to all signs and in particular, focus on safety warnings.
Jellyfish cubes occur near the beach and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally occur outside of this time period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
Freshwater crocodiles do not actively live in the sea, their primary habitat is in river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveller the assurance that they will have a place to stay upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agencies often have arrangements with specific hotels, although you may also be able to book other types of accommodation, such as camping sites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport to and from the airport or even a combination of flight and hotel.
They can also hold your reservation for you in case you need time to reconsider the offer or to obtain additional documents for your travel destination (e.g. visas).
However, any changes or inquiries should be directed to the travel agency first and not to the hotel directly.
At many festivals, the vast majority of attendees decide to camp on site, and most visitors see this as an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to get there early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that music will still be played late into the night in parts of the festival, even after the music on the main stages has stopped.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the position of the cabin, as the breaking of ice causes quite horrible noise for those most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg also offer time for a stay in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to keep guests on the premises for as long as possible and to get them to spend a lot of money. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits can be hard to find.
They usually have a special offer of food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests happy and ensure they stay.
Some venues offer free alcoholic drinks, but intoxication impairs judgement and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who wants to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes should expect snow, ice and temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snow-covered roads, traction is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
In snowstorms, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you can get stuck.
Visibility can also be impaired by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
In common usage, the term safari refers to a land journey to observe the overwhelming African animal world, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and the standard equipment allows for a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are often shy and you can observe them better with a pair of binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bushwalk", "walking safari" or "footing") consists of a hike that lasts either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Olympic Summer Games, having already hosted the games in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March, most cancellation policies were not in effect until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place, due to the coronavirus.
It is estimated that most tickets for the event will cost between 2,500¥ and 130,000¥, with an average ticket costing around 7,000¥.
Ironing damp clothes can help dry them. Many hotels provide irons and ironing boards, even if you are not in the room.
If an iron is not available or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if one is available.
Be careful not to heat the fabric too much (this can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, cause burns).
There are various methods for purifying water, some of which are more effective in counteracting certain dangers.
In some areas, it is enough to boil water for one minute, in others it must be boiled for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies widely, and if you have concerns, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with from their home regions.
Pests can destroy food, cause irritations or, in the worst case, even trigger allergic reactions, administer poison or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases as such, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans with violence, are usually not classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and consumption taxes in certain locations.
Travellers whose destination country has high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, particularly on products such as alcoholic drinks and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway is the biggest driving challenge, as it often leads through remote, uninhabited terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, stay alert: steep slopes, narrow roads and sharp curves are common here.
The speed limits given are noticeably lower than in the preceding and following sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict adherence is even more important than usual.
But interestingly, cell phone coverage is much better here than in many other areas of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite tasty. In Bavaria they are quite nutritious and varied, as is the case with our southern neighbour Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples being baked into pastries all year round and cherries and plums being used in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts or other nuts. Popular cakes often go particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to make small but rich pastries, then try what is called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid used.
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With a choice of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without further attributes, the term generally refers to the food that originates from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is now widespread throughout the island group, offers a variety of simply seasoned dishes. The Javanese prefer to use peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut flower sugar) and a range of aromatic spices as flavorings.
Martingales are aids for the feet of riders, which hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They give the rider more stability, but there are safety concerns because the rider's feet could get caught in them.
If a rider falls off a horse and gets their foot caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged along if the horse runs on. To minimize this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
In addition, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety buckles that allow a stirrup leather to fall from the saddle as soon as it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley – Chile’s premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite National Park of South America, with a multitude of large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks offer a breathtaking view. Climbers from all over the world keep discovering new routes along the walls, which offer endless possibilities.
Downhill sports such as skiing and snowboarding involve attaching skis or a snowboard to your feet and riding down a slope over a snow-covered surface.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan their entire vacation around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The origins of skiing as a sport can be traced back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians in 1861.
Ski hiking with a backpack: This activity is also called ski touring or ski hiking.
It is similar to alpine touring skiing or mountaineering, but does not necessarily include it, as the latter is performed in steep terrain and requires much firmer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route like a comparable hiking route.
In good conditions, you are able to cover slightly greater distances than when hiking – only very rarely will you achieve the speed of cross-country skiing on well-maintained trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has numerous independent countries. Normally, if you want to travel through several countries, you would have to apply for multiple visas and go through several passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, works a bit like a country in this regard.
As long as you stay within this zone, you can normally cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Accordingly, you do not need to apply for a visa individually for each of the Schengen member countries with a Schengen visa, which saves time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes an antique, with some tax authorities defining goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, with the age limit being lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handmade products could be described as "antique" even though they are younger than similar products from mass production.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many who work in other professions.
In the past, not all Sámi have raised reindeer on a large scale, but have lived off fishing, hunting and the like. They mainly kept reindeer as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
"Even if the term 'gypsy' is used mainly by non-Roma, it is often perceived as offensive, as it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma."
If a travel advisory is issued for the country you will be visiting, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the advice of other governments, but their advice is tailored to their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may be facing different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Briefings are just a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general and oversimplified in comparison to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
A storm is the collective term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, severe social disruption or loss of life.
Storms can occur anywhere in the world and there are different types of them that depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall and forest fires are forms and effects of storms, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, flash floods and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena include, among others, blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are urged to keep an eye on any kind of weather event affecting their area as it could impact all travel plans.
Anyone planning to travel to a country that is considered a war zone should undergo professional training for it.
"A web search for 'course on hostile environments' is likely to reveal the address of a local firm."
A course usually covers all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course is usually between 2 and 5 days long and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are numerous books and journals on survival in the wilderness, but few publications on war zones.
Travellers planning gender-reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid identification documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with a non-specified gender (X) or documents updated to the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents is also very different.
Searches at security checks have also become far more intrusive since 11 September 2001.
Transgender people before their surgery should not expect their privacy and dignity to be intact when passing through the scanners.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves breaking on the beach, often near reefs or the like.
Due to the underwater topography, the backflow is concentrated in a few deeper areas and a fast current can form there all the way down to deep water.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion while trying to swim against the current, which can prove impossible.
When you get out of the current, swimming back is not more difficult than normal.
Try to get somewhere where you won't be caught again, or alternatively, depending on your abilities and whether you've been spotted, maybe wait for rescue.
The return shock comes earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is not as pronounced), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travellers who find it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to adapt to their culture of origin.
When you come back home after a stay abroad, you have adapted to a different culture and dropped some behaviors of your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew travelers have to adjust to a new country.
One might not expect that patience and understanding are also required towards returning travellers.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and while it's quiet, before the show starts.
Normally, you can hear the sounds of tourists and vendors all the time. The story of the sounds and the light is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as a background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are depicted on the pyramids, with the various pyramids being illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most stations. In 2020, sixteen were active.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworthland is the region south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here merge into the plateau and then rise up again to form the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which are divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak, Mount Vinson, is 4,892 m high.
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outside and in clear line of sight of a satellite to make a call.
The service is commonly used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that require data and voice communications.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide further information on connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for people planning to take a year out are study and course offerings abroad.
This is very popular among school leavers as it allows them to take a year out before university without it affecting their studies.
In many cases, participation in an overseas gap year program can actually improve your chances of pursuing higher education in your home country.
As a rule, a tuition fee is charged for enrolling in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boating trips. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands - in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht for the archipelagos and lakes.
Even if the coastal island groups and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national leisure activity in Finland, with one in six or eight people owning a boat.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one to forty.)
Most pure Baltic Sea cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg in Russia.
This means you can visit the historic town for several whole days, returning in the evening to stay on the ship.
If you only go on land during the boat excursions, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises advertise Berlin in Germany as a destination in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be a daunting experience for people of any age and from any walk of life, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: this is nothing more than the personal fears and antipathies that many people have.
Learning more about how airplanes work and the procedures during a flight can help some people overcome the fear associated with the unknown or the feeling of having no control.
Courier companies are well paid for the fast delivery of things, often time is a very important factor in business documents, commercial goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger carriers use their own planes, but on other routes and with smaller carriers, difficulties have arisen.
When they shipped things by air freight, the unloading and customs clearance on some routes could take several days.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as unaccompanied baggage, as airline regulations do not allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious method of flying first or business class is to splash out a lot of money for the privilege (or, even better, get your own company to foot the bill).
However, this is not cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class and eleven times for first class!
In general, it is pointless to look for discounts on direct flights from A to B, even for business or first class seats.
Airlines know very well that there is a core group of flyers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but many people also speak Russian.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
This conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova in 1994, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of the Republic of Moldova have been restored.
The most important religion in Moldova is Christian Orthodoxy.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.
The former ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, progressive and busy commercial center, located on a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glazed buildings and modern shopping centres are characterised by classic red tile roofs, the 18th-century market as well as old mosques and churches, although the city exudes more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than that of traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
There are some interesting marble sculptures of doves on some of the graves in the cemetery.
It is worth taking a half hour stroll through the fascinating village.
To the north and in close proximity is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after Lord Byron described its beauty in vivid colours.
The Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra via Cabo da Roca.
Also visit in the north the great sanctuary of Our Lady of the Rosary of Fatima (pilgrimage site) - a place that is world-famous for its Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave site and a place that holds almost immeasurable significance for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived their time here, and many more with relatives who were murdered or worked to death there, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this site with the dignity, awe and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site by applying or scratching graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as it is legally established as the first official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely spoken in public transport and other facilities.
Normal announcements on the metro are made exclusively in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are reported by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are said to be self-centered, rude and arrogant.
Even if this is often just an inaccurate cliché, one can get along best in Paris if one shows their best side and behaves like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-bred). This will make things much easier.
The gruff exterior of the Parisians disappears very quickly when they display basic manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, with mainly beech, spruce and fir trees, and offers a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to its numerous microclimates, different soils and alternating altitudes, it boasts a remarkably wide variety of plant communities.
The area is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
There are rare fauna such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wildcats and capercaillie, as well as many species that are generally more common.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that reach above the knee and cover their shoulders.
While most monasteries will have wrap dresses for women who come unprepared, if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will give you a smile.
Similarly, men must wear pants that reach above the knee.
These can also be borrowed from stock at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each user, so you might not feel comfortable in these dresses. There is one size for all men!
The cuisine of Majorca, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and always uses olive oil.
A simple popular dinner, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available ingredients such as cheese, tuna etc.
"All nouns, next to the word 'you', always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence."
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It does make reading easier, but writing is somewhat difficult because you have to determine whether a verb or adjective is being used as the main word.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
"Also, pay attention to how you pronounce r and rr: caro means "love", while carro means "chariot".
The Persian language has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introductory grammar would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
If you speak a Romance language, it is of course easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak some Spanish might be quick to conclude that Portuguese is so similar that it doesn't need to be learned separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually no longer in operation today and serve as museums or educational sites.
As light pollution was not the problem it is today during their heyday, they are usually located in cities or university campuses that are easier to access than those built more recently.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Watching cherry blossoms, known as Hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where peach blossoms are the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy in the vicinity of the imperial court.
"Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even one."
If you visit a formally laid-out garden and collect "samples", you will also be thrown out without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place where you can get by well and almost everything can be bought after arrival.
As you are in the extreme tropics and only a few degrees north of the equator, you need to expect both heat (all the time) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
There are also a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives.
Make sure the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good basis for holiday planning.
For example, castle tours in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also represent popular hiking and cycling routes.
In Christianity, Christmas is one of the most important holidays and is considered the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions around the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night at some open spot to see the sunrise.
There are of course Christian-theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with the celebrations often starting at midnight, when the resurrection of Christ is celebrated.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying or being washed up.
Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals were not able to make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the main prey animal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since the first humans arrived on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky is more or less dark all around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you can also enjoy the starry sky.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
Suits are part of the standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by their family names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is of crucial importance, with the focus being more on group performance than on praise for individual achievements.
Often, employees must seek approval from their superiors for any decisions they make, and they are expected to follow their bosses' instructions unconditionally.
