This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely accepted, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on top and light or carotinoid in color on the bottom.
The discovery also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaurian feathers lack a well-developed shaft, called the rachis, but possess other features of feathers - barbs and barbules - the researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display purposes. The researchers suspected that the sample, although it was the tail of a young dinosaur, displayed the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chick.
The researchers claimed that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the plumage of an adult and not that of a juvenile.
A car bomb detonated in the morning of the previous day at the police headquarters in the Turkish city of Gaziantep, killing two police officers and injuring over twenty other people.
According to information from the Governor's office, nineteen of the injured are police officers.
Police said they suspected a militant supporter of Daesh (ISIL) was behind the attack.
They found that the sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: It turns out that the activity of all stars in the system is driven by their luminosity, rotation and nothing else.
In order to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow, the luminosity and the rotation are taken into account together.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of reversals of the magnetic field.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon attracts the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way exerts gravitational forces on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists concluded that dark matter acts on other dark matter in the same way that normal matter acts on normal matter.
This theory suggests that the majority of dark matter is located in a type of halo around a galaxy and consists of many small particles.

Extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was discovered by Dr. Tony Moll in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
"In an interview, he said the new variant is 'extremely worrying and alarming because of the very high mortality rate.'"
Some patients may have contracted the pathogen in hospital, believes Dr. Moll, and at least two were medical hospital staff.
Within a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
Still, the proportion of XDR-TB in the overall population of people with tuberculosis appears to be low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected in South Africa at any given time.

Infrared images show temperature differences between night and day, indicating that these are likely to be caves.
“They are colder during the day than the surrounding surface, and warmer at night.”
"Their thermal behaviour is not as uniform as that of large caves on Earth, which often have a fairly constant temperature, but it does agree that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing from the astrogeology team at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a pre-printed piece of paper, on which the candidate of their choice is written, into an envelope.
After the officials have confirmed the identity of the voter, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law sets out the procedure quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that no envelopes are present at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those of properly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process, and on the evening the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

In addition to the event on Wednesday, Carpanedo took part in the championship in two individual races.
Their first event was the slalom, in which they received a "did not finish" in their first run; 36 of the 116 participants achieved the same result in this race.
In her other race, the giant slalom, she finished in 10th place in the women's group with a combined run time of 4:41.30. This was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the winning Austrian competitor Claudia Lösch and 1:09.02 minutes faster than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, who finished in 9th place.
Four skiers from Krückenskifahrens did not make it to the finish line, and 45 of the total 117 skiers in the giant slalom were unable to place in the race.
The police of Madhya Pradesh have found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman, and we have seized her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanja, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car crashed in, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road on which the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
As a result, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
In the meantime, Adekoya has been charged with the murder of her son at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is being held in custody pending charges and trial, but statements from eyewitnesses could be tainted because her image has been widely published.
This is standard practice elsewhere in Britain, but the Scottish legal system operates differently and the courts have deemed publication of the photos potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes: "Journalists seem to be crossing a dangerous line when they publish photos etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is leading the prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made until at least after the indictment.
According to the leak, the document refers to the border dispute in which the Palestinians demand a return to the borders that existed prior to the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other topics that are supposedly covered include the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding a military presence in the Jordan Valley for a period of ten years following the signing of the agreement, whereas the Palestinian Authority, on the other hand, is willing to accept such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the accompanying trial to control the plague should be closely supervised by handlers, as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers have been recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of Park Conservation and Heritage in the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first cull received comprehensive safety and training.
Martelly swore in a new provisional electoral commission (CEP) with nine members yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP within four years.
Last month, a presidium commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures aimed at steering the country towards new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to widespread regime-critical protests that began in October.
The trigger for the sometimes violent protests was the failure to hold elections, some of which have been pending since 2011.
Over 60 cases of overheating have been reported in defective iPods, resulting in six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that it had been informed of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week METI announced that it had been informed by Apple of a further 34 cases of overheating, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded by describing Apple's delaying of the report as "really regrettable."
The earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas Office of Homeland Security said no damage had been reported in the territory.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and there are currently at least six confirmed deaths.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, along with the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the place of an elderly lady when she needed to use the restroom, and Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
During his work at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature labor in his free time.
His research showed that the use of a hormone accelerated the lung maturation of the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators retrieved two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Luna’s fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to him.
"Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Very unique, just like her. A strong woman.""
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented: "Luna was just as crazy as I am... maybe even crazier... I love her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed ahead of the 2010 federal election, the proportion of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 per cent since 2008.
The then acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared during the election campaign for the 2010 federal election that in her opinion Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
Twenty-nine percent of those surveyed said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medalist at the Olympic Games was supposed to compete in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle events, as well as in three medley relays, at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was called into question due to his numerous injuries.
He was unable to take the required medication to manage his pain as it is banned at the Commonwealth Games.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Numerous people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for the Earth, along with organic matter that can form proteins and enable life.
As comets collided with the Earth long ago, scientists hope to gain insights into how planets, particularly the Earth, came to be.
Cuomo (53) took up his governorship earlier this year and last month signed a bill to legalise same-sex marriage.
He described the rumours as "political nonsense and foolishness".
It is speculated that he could run for the office of President in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It relies on satellite-based technology instead of older ground radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate planes and provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional transportation services will be put in place and above-ground trains will not stop at Wembley. There are no parking facilities or park-and-ride services available on site.
Concerns about a lack of transportation options increased the likelihood that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had developed within just two generations, despite the fact that it was previously believed that this process would take much longer due to mating between a native Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the introduced cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into a wide variety of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued onto other metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images, called illuminated manuscripts, in books, which are called illuminated manuscripts.
This is known as the pH value of a chemical. You can use red cabbage juice to create an indicator.
Coulrope changes colour depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the "H" in pH) in the chemicals being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then shape them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and creates a kind of protective layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, which was connected to a sophisticated wastewater system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the houses of Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Even in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, there were toilets. In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, which men and women visited in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it almost immediately back down to Earth.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and our view somewhat.
It takes a giant rocket, more than 100 feet tall, to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The bicycle has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest service the bicycle has rendered us is much easier and faster transportation.
It has brought us the railway, the car and many other means of transportation.
Among them are medium-sized cats that eat prey of a similar size, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are still many small cats (including domestic cats that roam free) that eat much smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche, a special task that each cat has and which ensures that they do not compete with each other.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups called prides.
The groups consist of one to three related adult males, as well as up to thirty females and young.
Women usually have a close relationship with each other when they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave in a similar way to wolf or dog packs, animals that surprisingly share similar behaviours with lions (but not with other big cats) and are equally deadly towards their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (albeit not particularly well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars, the only four cats that can roar.
The roar of a tiger doesn't sound like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a sentence made up of grumbly, growled-out words.
Ozelots eat small animals. When they can, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that the ozelot hunts are significantly smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate their prey using their sense of smell, sniffing where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and can move unnoticed. Ozelots hunt their prey by optically blending into their surroundings and then attacking their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population it came from (for example, if they move over a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations in order to be a strong competitor, than what it needed before.
The original population has not changed at all; it still requires the same adaptations as before.
Over time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, and it becomes less and less similar to the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, two populations can look so different that they can no longer be classified as belonging to the same species.
This process is what we call speciation, which simply means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants generate the oxygen that humans breathe in, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., breathe out).
Plants produce their food through photosynthesis using the sun, and they also provide shade.
We build our houses out of plants and make clothes out of plants. We mainly feed on plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other Mosasauruses.
Its long jaws were equipped with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, in addition to another set in its throat, which meant that there was no escape for any animal that crossed its path.
We're not sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. It fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and may have even been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that came into the water; even a large dinosaur like the T. Rex was no match for it.
While most of their food will be familiar to us, the Romans did have their fair share of strange or unusual feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a type of rodent called a seven-toed shrew.
Another difference was that poor people and women ate their meals while seated on chairs, while wealthy men preferred to hold joint banquets where they would lie on their sides while eating.
Dishes from ancient Rome could not contain any foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have maize, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
Offerings were brought to the gods, and the priests attempted to appease the gods' will through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner altar room, which could only be entered by priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called zikkurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses did not hold as much significance.
The majority of the Hebrew family's life took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard. Shops simply consisted of shop windows facing the street. Stone was used for building houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. According to old Norse legends, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he continued his journey westward, he discovered Greenland and gave it its name.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although all the countries were "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The words "original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776" were written on the back of the Declaration of Independence, with the text upside down on the bottom of the document.
While no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches x 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage at the beginning of its life.
It is therefore possible that the notation was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landing and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
"He was ruled by the 'Vichy' French. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were working with the conquerors, instead of fighting against them."
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
After just two weeks, the Americans and the French liberation forces had liberated the south of France and were heading towards Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and which also somehow defines the size of a society.
City-states are the precursors to nations. A civilized culture implies the passing down of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and appropriate dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical records and fail to be recognized as legitimate civilizations.
During the revolutionary struggles, the 13 federal states first formed a weak central government based on the Federal Treaty, which consisted only of the Congress.
The Congress was not empowered to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities to enforce all of its laws, which often did not cooperate.
He also had no authority to suspend tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous agreement of all states before they could be amended, and states took the central government so lightly that their representatives often failed to show up.
The Italian national football team is, together with the German national football team, the second most successful team in the world and was the 2006 FIFA World Champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians participate in international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan possesses almost 7,000 islands (with Honshu being the largest), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
"Due to the cluster/group of islands, Japan is, and often will be geographically referred to as an ""archipelago""."
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed by and documented the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a settlement in the southwest of Taiwan, thereby initiating a change in the grain farming methods of the indigenous people and employing Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces from the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the government of the Qing Dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which they relinquished sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists mainly of three structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Sun Temple, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most widely used image format worldwide is 35 mm, which corresponds to the predominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its image format has been adopted by digital camera image sensor formats.
More precisely, the so-called 35 mm format measures, confusingly, 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore referred to as 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) have the exact same or a very similar aspect ratio.
The much-maligned and often ridiculed thirds rule is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining a sense of order in an image.
It states that the point where the lines that divide a picture into thirds vertically and horizontally intersect is the most effective place for the main subject (see example).
During this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion has held European nations together despite different languages and customs.
His omnipotence controlled everyone, from the king to the common citizen.
One of the key tenets of the Christian faith is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that it is the churches' duty to do so.
The central power of the church had been located in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money led many to doubt whether this principle was being upheld.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off the country from vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated universally recognized international law, codified by multiple international agreements over the past two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters in order to prevent ships from advancing into entire sections of the sea, which even posed a danger to neutral ships.
As the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted U-boat warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After experiencing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take up a position at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents in his possession, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor from his previous job) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Old China had a unique method of indicating different ages: each period of time in China, and each family that held power, was its own dynasty.
There were also periods of instability between the different dynasties, during which the country was divided into several provinces. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this time, bitter wars were waged among many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The era of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying in the fight for the highest throne in the grand palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift away from absolutism towards republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the land belongs to the people and not just to one ruler.
After the revolution, all professions were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and capable individuals to succeed.
The same applies to the military, as army rankings are now based on caliber rather than class membership.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was very interested in things that went beyond everyday life. He often visited a cave, which became known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (light), in order to meditate.
The cave itself has survived the ages and offers a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not at all easy to find, even if you know it exists; once you are inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
You see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave, there is very little of the world visible or audible.
The Cheops Pyramid is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Cheops Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, includes several pyramids (with the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, as well as the large Sphinx.
The large pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed in honor of Cheops' wives and family members.
The “swab” symbol looks like a V, and the “no swab” symbol like a bracket or a square with a missing bottom line.
Upwards means that you should start at the top and push the bow. Downwards means that you should start at the frog (that's where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Applying the brush in a sweeping motion usually generates a softer sound, while sweeping in the opposite direction produces a stronger, more expressive sound.
You are welcome to add your own pencil markings; however, remember that the printed sheet markings are there for musical reasons, and should therefore normally be respected.
The panicked King Louis the XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) as well as the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced by a mob of market women to return to Paris on October 6th, 1789.
They travelled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming mob of people who hurled threats at the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages wide.
At one point, a member of the angry mob held up the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles before the horrified queen's eyes.
The costs of the US imperialists' war to conquer the Philippines were borne by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover the bulk of expenses, and the interest from bonds flowed through Wall Street banking houses on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the superprofits that came from the ongoing exploitation of the Philippine people were the fundamental gains of US imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The epoch in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, an era in European history that spanned the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 CE).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which all ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technology push or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic tied to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general assumptions: firstly, that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond the reach of cultural or political influence, and secondly, that technology itself has "impacts" on societies that are more inherent than socially determined.
For example, it can be argued that the development of roads is an inevitable consequence of the production of passenger vehicles.
However, a nationwide road network for only a small number of cars is not economically viable, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The widespread ownership of automobiles also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element that drew on writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, it is geography that shaped individuals. Over time, customs and cultures emerged that were related to this geography, and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than laws arbitrarily imposed from above.
Just as Paris is known today as the fashion capital of the world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a centre of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined over the course of the twelfth century, largely because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than what was on offer in the Byzantine markets.
At that time, the title of the fashion capital of the world also moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
At the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the east.
However, styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind due to slow communication channels.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothing.
Subsistence farming is agriculture that aims to produce just enough food to cover the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic method of farming that uses saved, locally-sourced seed and combines it with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by societal norms, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differentiate themselves from others based on age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture as such can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical in nature, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through an unmistakable and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits, and jargon.
One of the most common methods of illustrating the importance of socialisation is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune or intentional abuse during their childhood, were not socialised by adults.
"Such children are referred to as 'feral' or wild. Some feral children were kept captive by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, the child's neglect was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's significant intellectual or physical disabilities."
Wolf children may have experienced severe child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are believed to have been raised by animals; some are thought to have lived alone in the wild.
If it was raised entirely by animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within the limits of its physical abilities) that are almost entirely in line with those of its specific caretakers, such as their fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, “scaffolding” goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a tool that assists individuals in a novel learning situation, such as when using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Frameworks can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of framework, as is the little paperclip icon in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistance features have been built into the software and are designed to question, suggest, and explain work steps that the student may not be able to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to coercion.
No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not caring, nurturing and education-focused, but many are.
For us, the system of residential care provides a measure of security for these children.
Our foster care system is meant to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The foster home is intended to cover all the needs that the children did not receive in the home from which they were taken.
The internet connects elements of mass communication as well as interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the approach to benefits and rewards.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998), when they examined audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important insights for the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting minimal changes in facial expression.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who have lost the ability to understand language due to brain damage can still correctly assess the honesty of others.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation creates new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools back and forth with each generation.
Out in the savannah, it's tough for a primate with a digestive system like ours to get enough amino acids from the plant sources available.
Moreover, there are serious consequences for failing to do so: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
Overall, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to how chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Sleep fragmentation is the process of being purposefully awakened during normal sleep periods and falling asleep a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you are someone who sets the alarm while you are asleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option is to drink a lot of liquid (particularly water or tea, known for its diuretic effect) before bed, so that you are forced to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner calm a person possesses correlates inversely with the degree of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the level of tension, the more positive the life force is. Every person has the potential to find absolute calmness and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded with the path of love of Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple: it consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation lies god yoga, in which the energy channels are cleansed by visualizing various deities, the chakras are opened, and enlightened consciousness is achieved.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the end of the war, the clash of systems, the course of events, and the cultures led to the countries becoming enemies.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last the next 40 years, and in reality it would be fought out by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence had already completely collapsed and the only hope lay in a retreat and a reorganisation along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans, however, became almost obsolete overnight as over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, creating them after having invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient method for transporting large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure a country remains capable of moving people and goods, while simultaneously impeding an enemy's ability to do the same.
One of the most significant recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, when the Americans attempted to bring manpower and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy attempted to stop this traffic mainly using submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Great Britain just like the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran as early as around 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them as livestock in order to easily obtain their milk, fur, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed hills or other grazing areas. The goats were tended by goat herders, much like the more familiar sheep herders; often these were children or adolescents. This method of grazing is still used today.
As early as the 16th century, they built conveyor tracks in England.
Although the tramways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the carriages to travel at higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
Thresholds were introduced quite early on to secure the position of the rails, but the realisation gradually set in that rails that carry a strip of iron are more efficient.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels, and in 1767 the first completely iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking. Two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo erectus (which means "upright man"), humans began walking upright.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as regularly.
Bipedal species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering.
In many cases, this is just like treating the symptoms. However, if you want more than just temporary solutions, we should find and treat the root of the problem.
It is really obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity, and that the problems caused by overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyles of people have become more serious.
After its passage by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
Over the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are known today as the "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document; the original manuscript did not survive the test of time.
Many paleontologists now believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still with us today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them to be dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, many things about birds still look like they did in the days of the dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the processing of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits – or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent; the symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best sign of poisoning from ingestion may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Look on the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term is derived from the long-standing familiarity with bed bugs, insects that are highly adaptable in their ability to parasitize humans.
Both bed bugs and cockroaches are nidicolous, meaning they are adapted to live in the nests or dwellings of their hosts.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most widespread neurological disease among adults of younger and middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their own best interest or in the best interest of their child to raise a baby.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their baby.
In the case of adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights, allowing another couple to assume parenthood.
The main goal of science is to use the scientific method to figure out how the world works. This method is indeed the foundation of most scientific investigations.
However, it is not just about experimentation, where an experiment is a test designed to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by asking questions and conducting observations.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, with particular attention paid to the Bible in the Latin language.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were widely accepted.
With the loss of knowledge of the Greek language, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often largely based on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Behaviors determined by a cycle, which are not just reactions to signals from external cycles, are known in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that execute free-swinging cycles for a period of time, even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they either labelled the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have a wide range of effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material in question, and whether the cells in question are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of activities that can be done on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small towns in their cars to go to work and are passed by others whose workplace is where they have just left.
In this dynamic back-and-forth traffic, everyone is connected to some extent to a transportation system based on private cars, and supports it.
Science is now pointing out that this massive carbon economy has pulled the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has sustained human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems lead to such problems, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent, or is something more fundamental at play here?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a relatively consistent manner; as a result, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
In order to better represent the flow of traffic, the relationships between the three most important characteristics were defined: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design and operation of facilities on the highway.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the skies. Their ability to fly helped them evade predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings back along their bodies.
As a result, they have a wider selection of small hiding places where they can hide from predators.
Today, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the sun was at the center of the movements of the solar system.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the Earth.
That seems reasonable, as it doesn't seem like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second-longest and the most water-rich river on Earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second-largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, in some places up to six miles wide.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans via the planet's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon river is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and takes in water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size or the technical perfection of their construction.
Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom marvelled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were over a thousand years old at the time.
Vatican City has approximately 800 inhabitants and is the smallest independent state in the world, as well as the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language of most who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known to humans since ancient times, as they can all be found in their original form in nature and can be extracted using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This corresponded more to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma. However, he also put forward the theory that they transform into new substances in order to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals like silver and gold as well.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The universe as a whole is made up of matter, and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that billions of them would fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
As a result, the pencil became a good friend to many people after its invention.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the use of pencils has been relegated to the background, causing it to lose its status and use.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens without ever having to get near a typewriter.
It will be interesting to see what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that energy is required to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's a bit like rolling a heavy car up a hill: when the core splits again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they decay even with a small or no initial stimulus.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the sea and thicker under the highlands.
On the near side there could be more Maria because the crust is thinner, making it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
In terms of content, theories focus on finding what moves or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized over the course of their development into adulthood.
These theories deal with what motivates certain people to want exactly what they do, and what influences in their environment lead them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of the hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when managers start to lead their former colleagues: one end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or one of the girls).
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognisable individual who has to do everything differently from the way the team has done it, and you take credit for everything.
Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behaviour often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are managed to the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams may meet across different time zones that local management may not account for.
The presence of a genuine "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"The 'invisible team' is the leadership team, to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member."
Why would an organization undertake the time-consuming process of implementing a learning organization? A goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized across all departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can flourish.
As a result, the collaborative work of an organization in overcoming an obstacle can lead to the creation of a new innovative method for addressing customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must develop a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum concept as a method to help organizations become more effective.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus defining and refining the field of research.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, such as trauma, injury, and tumors, can affect behavior and result in changes in certain brain functions.
Emerging technologies are allowing us to see and study certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand what goes on in our heads.
Although strongly associated with science fiction, AI is an important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of AI involves the creation of machines for automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include control systems, the creation of strategies and timelines, the ability to answer customer queries and diagnose problems, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become their own disciplines, focused on finding solutions to real-life problems.
Today, AI systems are commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and have also been integrated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every school class. Not infrequently, a teacher would like to take her or his students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Virtual excursions represent a technical solution: students can view museum pieces, visit an aquarium or admire works of art from their classroom.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital; the website is redesigned each year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. While students often have sloppy grammar and spelling at the beginning of their blogging experience, this usually changes when they have an audience.
As students are often a very critical audience, the blog author makes an effort to improve his writing style in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging "also forces students to learn more about the world around them." The need to engage the interest of the audience inspires students to write in a smart and engaging way (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively engaging with internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of the texts of others and articulate their own perspectives on particular topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital city, and is known for its array of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things, and more, make Ontario what outsiders consider to be quintessentially Canadian.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A demographic comparison that may surprise many: there are more African Americans living in the USA than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, in terms of animal life, a continent of its own.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or belong to France and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and it was very successful on the Comoros and in Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese sailor Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel zone, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travellers claim to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (just not one that looks too expensive.
Women should recognise that cultural differences can lead to what they would perceive as assault, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Stay consistent when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to defend your position (cultural differences aside; that still doesn't make it okay!)
The present-day Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids under the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el Beida and it was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to go shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of tinnies are sold, but that is all just for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, particularly the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any stay outside of Goma should be carefully planned to account for the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The town is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as for some of the cheapest gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
You can use bodabodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
This, combined with its relative inaccessibility, has led to "Timbuktu" becoming a metaphor for exotic, far-off countries.
Although Timbuktu is known for its reputation as a tourist attraction and has an airport, it is a destitute city today.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the key locations featured in Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World."
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, as it has a more Arabic than African feel to it.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa, and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different animal life.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park charges daily conservation and entrance fees.
It may also be worthwhile to purchase a Wild Card, which grants access either to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the namesake of the territory of Hong Kong and is a focal point for many tourists.
The buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline were compared to a glittering bar chart, visible through the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour. x
For the best views of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and head to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed on newly reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers made their own. If you are looking for traces of the area's colonial past, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world and extend over 80 km from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland to the coast.
The Sundarbans were declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest that lies within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps – they also include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², a third of which is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans have been a nature reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer living there.
Buses run all day from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river), with most buses, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leaving between 06:30 and 07:30.
As the buses between the districts are often full, it is recommended to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are serviced by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Shuttle buses offer a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers are 83 metres high, it is 378 metres long and has two lanes each 3.50 metres wide.
The clearance height under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction work was completed in August 2011, but the road was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to begin operating fully in September 2017, by which time it is expected that the Brazilian customs checkpoints will be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group to inhabit present-day eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the Great Province of the West Indies, emerged in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous local groups.
The Spanish began the colonization period, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be viewed at other times of the year. x
Information on competitions and sales outlets for polo tickets can be found on the Asociacion Argentina de Polo website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), the value of which is pegged to the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West Store.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and with Stanley credit cards. US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the more remote islands, although British and US currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to find out which payment methods they accept.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside of the islands themselves, so you should exchange your money before leaving the island.
As Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, and temperatures above +30 °C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively chilly: Temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct rainy or dry seasons: the amount of precipitation remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to instructions from the park authorities, visitors are required to keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful bison, wapitis, elks, bears, and practically all large animals may appear to be, it can happen that they attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year for not keeping a safe distance, as these animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them enough space.
Also, be aware that odors can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling foods and maintain a clean campsite.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1750s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of an ignominious standoff with the navy in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All ships, with the exception of a British cruiser, were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organised by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town led to the killing of the chief, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
As Auckland spans two harbours, there are many beaches, the most popular of which are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe swimming areas, and most offer shade provided by Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at the port of Waitemata, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches that can get crowded, with a nice shopping promenade along the coast. Swimming here is safe.
The most important local beer is "Number One". It is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are plenty of French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines are perhaps more palatable.
The local tap water can be drunk without any concerns, but if you are worried, you can also easily find bottled water.
"For Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign. A small espresso is an 'espresso', a cappuccino is topped high with foam (not froth) and tea is served without milk."
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Although fruit juices are expensive, they are excellent.
Many trips to the reef occur throughout the year and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
However, you should still follow the advice of authorities, pay attention to all signs, and especially focus on safety warnings.
Cubomedusae occur near the shore and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally occur outside of this time period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
Freshwater crocodiles do not actively live in the sea, their primary habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveller the assurance that they will have a place to stay upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agencies often have arrangements with specific hotels, although you may also be able to book other types of accommodation, such as camping sites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even a combination of flight and hotel.
They can also hold your reservation for you in case you need time to reconsider your offer or to obtain additional documents for your travel destination (e.g. visas).
However, any changes or inquiries should be directed first to the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
At many festivals, the vast majority of attendees decide to camp on site, and most visitors see this as an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to get there early to secure a campsite near the music.
Remember that music will still be played at parts of the festival well into the night, even after the music on the main stages has stopped.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the position of the cabin, as the breaking of ice causes quite horrific noise for those most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg also offer time for a stay in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos generally go to great lengths to keep guests on the premises for as long as possible and get them spending money. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits can be hard to find.
They usually have a special offer of food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests happy and ensure they stay.
Some venues offer free alcoholic drinks, but intoxication impairs judgement and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone planning to travel in high latitudes or over mountain passes should expect snow, ice, and temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snow-covered roads, traction is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you can get stuck.
The field of vision can also be impaired by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
In common usage, the term "safari" refers to a journey through the countryside in order to observe the overwhelming African animal world, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and the standard equipment allows for a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are often shy and you can observe them better with a pair of binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "bushwalk", "walking safari", or "footing") consists of a hike that lasts either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Olympic Summer Games, having already hosted the event in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March most cancellation policies were not applicable until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place, due to the Coronavirus.
It is estimated that most tickets for the event will cost between 2,500¥ and 130,000¥, with an average ticket price of around 7,000¥.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry faster. Many hotels provide irons and ironing boards, even if you are not in the room.
If an iron is not available or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (this can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, lead to burns).
There are various methods for purifying water, some of which prove to be more effective in counteracting certain dangers.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others it must be boiled for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies widely, and if you have concerns, you should consider purchasing your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may come across animal pests that they are not familiar with from their home regions.
Pests can destroy food, cause irritations or, in the worst case, even trigger allergic reactions, administer poison or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases as such, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans, are not usually classified as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from duties and consumption taxes in certain locations.
Travellers whose destination country has high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, particularly on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway is perhaps the biggest driving challenge, as it often runs through remote, uncharted terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, remain vigilant: steep slopes, narrow roads, and sharp curves are common here.
The speed limits indicated are significantly lower than in the preceding and following sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict adherence is even more important than usual.
Interestingly, however, mobile phone coverage is much better here than in many other areas along the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite tasty. In Bavaria they are quite nutritious and varied, as is the case with Austria, our southern neighbour.
Fruit pastries are widespread, with apples being cooked into pastries all year round and cherries and plums being used in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts or other nuts. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to make small but delicious pastries, then try making what is known in different regions as Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, combined with either meat or vegetables.
Depending on the amount of liquid, a curry can be either "dry" or "moist."
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With a choice of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when the term is used without further attributes, it generally refers to the food that originates from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is now widespread throughout the island group, offers a variety of simply seasoned dishes. Javanese people prefer to use peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut flower sugar) and a range of aromatic spices as flavorings.
Martingales are aids for the feet of riders, which hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They give the rider more stability, but there are safety concerns because the rider's feet could get caught in them.
If a rider falls off a horse and gets their foot caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged along if the horse continues to move. To minimize this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
In addition, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety clasps that allow a stirrup leather to fall from the saddle as soon as it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley – Chile’s most important climbing destination, known as South America’s Yosemite National Park, with a multitude of large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks offer a breathtaking view. Climbers from all over the world keep discovering new routes along the walls, which offer endless possibilities.
Downhill sports such as skiing and snowboarding involve attaching skis or a snowboard to your feet and riding down a slope over a snow-covered surface.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan their entire vacation around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The origins of skiing as a sport can be traced back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Ski hiking with a backpack: This activity is also known as ski touring or ski hiking.
It is similar to alpine tour skiing and mountaineering, but does not necessarily include these activities, as the latter are performed in steep terrain and require much firmer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route like a comparable hiking route.
In good conditions, you are able to cover slightly greater distances than when hiking – only very rarely will you be able to maintain the same speed as when cross-country skiing on well-maintained trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has numerous independent countries. Normally, if you want to travel through several countries, you would have to apply for multiple visas and go through several passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, functions somewhat like a country in this regard.
As long as you remain within this zone, you can normally cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Accordingly, with a Schengen visa you do not need to apply for a visa individually for each of the Schengen member countries, which saves time, money, and bureaucracy.
There is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes an antique, with some tax authorities defining goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, with the age limit being lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handmade products could be described as "antique" even though they are younger than similar products from mass production.
Reindeer husbandry is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi people, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many who work in other professions.
In the past, not all Sámi raised reindeer on a large scale; instead, they made a living from fishing, hunting, and similar activities. They primarily kept reindeer as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
"Even if the term 'gypsy' is used primarily by non-Roma, it is often perceived as offensive, as it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma."
If a travel advisory is issued for the country you will be visiting, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the advice of other governments, but their recommendations are tailored to their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may be facing different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Briefings are merely a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general and oversimplified in comparison to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
A storm is the collective term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, severe social disruption or loss of human life.
Storms can occur anywhere in the world and there are different types of them that depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and forest fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, flash floods, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena include, among others, blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travellers are urged to keep an eye on any kind of weather event affecting their area as it could impact on all travel plans.
Anyone planning to travel to a country that is considered a war zone should undergo professional training for this purpose.
"A web search for 'course on hostile environments' is likely to reveal the address of a local firm."
A course usually covers all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course typically lasts between 2 and 5 days and includes role-playing exercises, a lot of first aid training, and sometimes weapons training.
There are numerous books and journals on survival in the wilderness, but only a few publications on war zones.
Travellers who plan to have gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they have valid identification documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with a gender designation of "X" or to update documents to reflect a person's preferred name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents also varies widely.
Searches at security checks have also become far more intrusive since 11 September 2001.
Transgender people before their operation should not expect their privacy and dignity to be intact when passing through the scanners.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves breaking on the beach, often found near reefs or the like.
Due to the underwater topography, the backflow is concentrated in a few deeper areas, and a rapid current can form there all the way down to deep water.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion while attempting to swim against the current, which can prove impossible.
When you get out of the current, swimming back is not more difficult than usual.
Try to get somewhere where you won't be caught again, or alternatively, depending on your abilities and whether you've been spotted, you might want to wait for rescue.
The return shock comes earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is not as pronounced), lasts longer, and can be more serious.
Travellers who have found it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to adapt to their culture of origin.
When you return home after a period spent abroad, you have adapted to a different culture and left behind some of the behaviours of your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew travelers have to adjust to a new country.
One might not expect that patience and understanding are also required when dealing with returning travelers.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and while it's quiet, before the show starts.
Normally, you can hear the sounds of tourists and vendors all the time. The history of the sounds and the light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as a background and narrator for a long story.
The scenes are depicted on the pyramids, with the various pyramids being illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most stations. In 2020, there were 16 active stations.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, which contains the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworthland is the region south of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula transition here into the plateau and then rise up again to form the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which are divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak, Mount Vinson, stands at 4892 m.
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone can be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outside in an area with a clear line of sight to a satellite in order to make a call.
The service is commonly used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that require data and voice communications over long distances.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide further information on connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for people planning to take a year out are study and course offerings abroad.
This is particularly popular among school graduates, as it allows them to take a year off before university without it affecting their studies.
In many cases, participation in a foreign gap year program can actually improve your chances of pursuing higher education in your home country.
As a rule, a tuition fee is charged for enrolling in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boating trips. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands – in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don’t necessarily need a yacht for the archipelagos and lakes.
Even if the coastal island groups and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime in Finland, with one in six or eight people owning a boat.
This is similar to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one to forty.)
Most pure Baltic Sea cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg in Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic town for several whole days, returning in the evening to stay on the ship.
If you only go on land during the boat excursions, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises advertise Berlin in Germany as a destination in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be a daunting experience for people of any age and from any walk of life, particularly if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: this is nothing more than the personal fears and antipathies that many people have.
Learning more about how airplanes work and the procedures during a flight can help some people overcome their fear of the unknown or feeling like they have no control.
Courier companies are well paid for the speedy delivery of things, often with time being a very important factor when it comes to business documents, commercial goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger carriers use their own planes, but on others and with smaller carriers, difficulties have arisen.
When sending things by air freight, unloading and customs clearance could take several days on some routes.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as unaccompanied baggage, as airline regulations do not allow luggage to be sent without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious method of flying first or business class is to fork out a large sum of money for the privilege (or, even better, get your own company to foot the bill).
However, this is not cheap: as a rough guide, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class, and eleven times for first class!
In general, it is pointless to look for discounts on direct flights from A to B, even for business or first class seats.
Airlines are well aware that there is a core group of flyers who are willing to pay a premium to get to their destination quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital city of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but many people also speak Russian.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
This conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova in 1994, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognised by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of the Republic of Moldova have been restored.
The most important religion in Moldova is Christian Orthodoxy.
Izmir is the third-largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second-largest port after Istanbul, and a very important transport hub.
The former ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, progressive and busy commercial center, located on a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glazed buildings, and modern shopping centers are characterized by classic red tile roofs, the market from the 18th century, as well as old mosques and churches, although the city exudes more of an atmosphere of Mediterranean Europe than that of traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
There are some interesting marble sculptures of doves on some of the graves in the cemetery.
It is worth taking a half hour stroll through the fascinating village.
To the north and in close proximity lies the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after Lord Byron described its beauty in vivid colours.
The Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra via Cabo da Roca.
In the north, you can also visit the great sanctuary of Our Lady of the Rosary of Fatima (pilgrimage site) – a place that is world-famous for its Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave site and a place that holds almost immeasurable significance for a large portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived the time here, and many more with relatives who were murdered or worked themselves to death there, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this site with the dignity, awe and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site by applying or scratching graffiti on it.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half of the residents prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and practically everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as it is legally established as the first official language.
Nonetheless, Spanish is also widely spoken in public transportation and other facilities.
Normal announcements on the metro are made exclusively in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are reported by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are said to be self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Even if this is often just an inaccurate cliché, you will find it easiest to get along in Paris if you show your best side and behave like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-bred). This will make it much easier for you to get along.
The gruff exterior of the Parisians disappears very quickly when they display basic manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, with mainly beech, fir, and pine trees, and offers a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to its numerous microclimates, different types of soil, and varying altitudes, it boasts a remarkably diverse range of plant communities.
The area is also home to a vast variety of animal and bird species.
There, you can find rare fauna such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wildcats, and capercaillie, as well as many species that are generally more commonly found.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that reach above the knee and cover their shoulders.
While most monasteries do have wrap dresses for women who come unprepared, if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will give you a smile.
Similarly, men must wear pants that reach above the knee.
These can also be borrowed from stock at the entrance, but the clothing is not washed after each user, so you might not feel comfortable wearing them. There is a single size for all men!
Like the cuisine of other Mediterranean regions, the cuisine of Majorca is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and always includes olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner option, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any other available toppings like cheese, tuna, etc.
"All nouns, when used next to the word 'you', always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence."
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It does make reading easier, but writing is somewhat difficult because you have to determine whether a verb or adjective is being used as the main word.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
"Also make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means ‘love’, while carro means ‘chariot”.
The Persian language has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introductory grammar would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
If you speak a Romance language, it is of course easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak some Spanish might be quick to conclude that Portuguese is so similar that it doesn't require a separate learning process.
Pre-modern observatories are usually no longer in operation today and serve as museums or educational sites.
As light pollution was not the problem it is today during their heyday, they are usually located in cities or university campuses that are easier to access than those built more recently.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Watching cherry blossoms, known as Hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where peach blossoms are the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy in the vicinity of the imperial court.
"Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even one."
If you visit a formally landscaped garden and collect "samples", you will also be thrown out without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place where you can get by just fine and can buy almost anything upon arrival.
As you are located in the extreme tropics and only a few degrees north of the equator, you must expect both heat (at all times) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less frequently).
There are also a few buses that head north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives.
Make sure the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good basis for planning your holiday.
For example, guided tours of castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube, or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also represent popular hiking and cycling routes.
In Christianity, Christmas is one of the most important holidays and is considered the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake at some open location in order to see the sunrise.
There are of course Christian-theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also very well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with the celebrations often starting at midnight, when the resurrection of Christ is celebrated.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands got there either by swimming, flying or being washed up on shore.
Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals were not able to make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the main source of food on the Galapagos islands.
Since the first humans set foot on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky is more or less dark all around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you can also enjoy the starry sky.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be accustomed to.
Suits are part of standard business attire, and colleagues address each other using their family names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is of crucial importance, with the focus being more on group performance than on praise for individual achievements.
Often, employees must seek approval from their superiors for any decision they make, and are expected to follow their bosses' instructions unconditionally.
