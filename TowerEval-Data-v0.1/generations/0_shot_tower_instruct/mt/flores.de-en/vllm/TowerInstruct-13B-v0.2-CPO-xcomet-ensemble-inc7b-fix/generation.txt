This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely accepted, but also provides details that fossils in general cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the coat of this animal was chestnut brown on the top and light or carotene-colored on the bottom.
The find also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called the rachis, but do have other features of feathers - barbules and barbs - the researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suspected that the sample, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, shows the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chick.
The researchers claimed that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the plumage of an adult and not chick down.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in the Turkish city of Gaziantep yesterday morning, killing two policemen and injuring more than twenty other people.
According to the Governor's Office, nineteen of the injured are police officers.
Police said they suspected a militant Daesh (ISIL) supporter was behind the attack.
They have found that the sun works on the same basic principles as other stars: it was found that the activity of all stars in the system is driven by their luminosity, rotation and nothing else.
To determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow, the luminosity and the rotation are taken into account together.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of reversals of the magnetic field.

The work was largely theoretical in nature, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon attracts the Earth and causes the tides, the Milky Way also exerts gravitational forces on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists concluded that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that the majority of dark matter is located in a type of halo around a galaxy and consists of many small particles.

Extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was discovered by Dr. Tony Moll in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
"In an interview, he said the new variant was 'extremely worrying and alarming because of the very high mortality rate.'"
Some patients may have picked up the bug in hospital, Dr Moll believes, and at least two were medical hospital staff.
Within a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
Nevertheless, the proportion of XDR-TB in the overall group of people with tuberculosis is still apparently low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people who were infected in South Africa at one time.

"They are colder than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night."
"Their thermal behavior is not as uniform as large caves on Earth, which often have a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with being deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the Astrogeology Team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: Voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a pre-printed sheet of paper, on which the candidate of their choice is written, into an envelope.
After the officials have confirmed the identity of the voter, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law lays down the procedure quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that at the beginning of the vote there are no envelopes present and that no envelopes are inserted, except those of the properly counted and authorized voters.
The candidates can send representatives to attend as witnesses to every part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to special procedures.

She finished her other race, the giant slalom, in 10th place in the women's group with a combined time of 4:41.30. She was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-placed Austrian Claudia Lösch and 1:09.02 minutes faster than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, who finished in 9th place.
Four skiers in the sitting skiing category did not make it to the finish line, and 45 of the total 117 female skiers in the giant slalom were unable to place in the race.
The police of Madhya Pradesh have found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
The deputy inspector general D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and seized her phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanja, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car crashed in, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with her son's murder at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in custody pending charges and trial, but statements from eyewitnesses could be tainted because her image has been widely published.
This is standard practice elsewhere in Britain, but the Scottish legal system works differently, and the courts have deemed the publication of photos to be potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes: "Journalists seem to be crossing a dangerous line when they publish photos etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is in charge of prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made until at least the indictment.
According to the leak, the document refers to the border dispute, in which the Palestinians demand a return to the borders in the state they were in before the Six-Day War of 1967.
Other issues that are supposedly covered include the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding a ten-year military presence in the Jordan Valley from the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority wants to accept such a presence for only five years.
The shooters of the accompanying trial to control the pest should be closely supervised by rangers, as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the managing director of Park Conservation and Heritage in the NPWS, the four marksmen selected for the first hunting operation received extensive safety and training instruction.
Martelly yesterday swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) with nine members.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP within four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The trigger for the sometimes violent protests was the failure to hold elections, some of which have been pending since 2011.
Over 60 cases of overheating in defective iPods have been reported, resulting in six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
"Last week, METI announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 more cases of overheating, which the company described as 'not serious.'"
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay of the report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake shook Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management said no damage was reported in the territory.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages were rescued and there are at least six confirmed deaths so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Philippine photographers.
The photographers took the place of an elderly lady when she had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a medical career.
He trained as a midwife and began work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature labor in his spare time.
His research showed that the use of a hormone accelerated the lung maturation of the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday retrieved two "black box" flight recorders.
Wrestling colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: ""Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Very unique, just like her. A strong woman."""
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels gave the following comment: "Luna was as crazy as I am... maybe even crazier... I love her and will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the proportion of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 per cent since 2008.
The then-acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
29 percent of those surveyed said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent said Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medal winner at the Olympic Games was supposed to swim in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle events, as well as in three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was called into question due to his many complaints.
He was unable to take the medication he needed to overcome his pain as it is banned at the Commonwealth Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Numerous people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets were possibly a source of the Earth's water supply, along with organic matter that can form proteins and enable life.
Since comets collided with the Earth a long time ago, scientists hope to gain insights into how planets, especially the Earth, came into being.
Cuomo (53) took up his post as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
It is speculated that he could run for the office of president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate planes more precisely and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transportation will be provided and the overground trains will not stop at Wembley. No parking or park-and-ride facilities will be available on site.
With the concern about a lack of transportation options, the likelihood grew that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new bird species on the Ecuadorean Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had developed within just two generations, although it was previously assumed that this process would take much longer due to the mating between a native Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into various forms. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued onto other metal. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures, called illuminated manuscripts, in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The kohl juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemicals being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then form them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels weird and forms a kind of protective layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, which was connected to an elaborate sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, which men and women visited in mixed company.
If you want to call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it almost immediately back down.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and our view.
It takes a gigantic rocket, more than 100 feet tall, to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest service the wheel has provided us is much easier and faster transportation.
It has brought us the railway, the car and many other means of transport.
Among them are medium-sized cats that eat prey of medium size, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that eat much smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, a special task that each cat has and which ensures that they do not compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups called prides.
The packs consist of one to three related adult males, as well as up to thirty females and young.
Women usually have a close relationship with each other when they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lion prides act similarly to wolf or dog packs, animals that surprisingly resemble lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior and are equally deadly towards their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (although not particularly well), swim, jump long distances and pull with the strength of five strong men.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger doesn't sound like the full-throated roar of the lion, but more like a series of guttural growls.
Ocelots eat small animals. When they can, they prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all of the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
Scientists think that ocelots track and locate their prey using their sense of smell, sniffing around where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and move around unnoticed. Ocelots hunt their prey by visually blending into their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it came (for example, if they move over a mountain range or river, or if they colonize a new island, so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different traits or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what it needed before.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, and then it looks less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, two populations then look so different that they can no longer be assigned to the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants generate the oxygen that humans breathe in, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., breathe out).
Plants produce their food through photosynthesis via the sun. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make our clothes from plants. We mainly feed ourselves from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other Mosasaurus.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 knife-like teeth, plus another set on the palate, which meant that there was no escape for any animal that crossed its path.
We're not sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. It fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and may even have been a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that came into the water; even a big dinosaur like the T. Rex was no match for him.
While most of their food may be familiar to us, the Romans did have their share of strange or unusual feast foods, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that poor people and women ate their meals while sitting on chairs, while rich men preferred to hold communal banquets, where they lay on their sides while eating their meals.
Dishes from ancient Rome could not have contained foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
They didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, for example, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
Sacrifices were made to the gods and the priests tried to comply with the will of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner altar room, which could only be entered by priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses did not have such a great significance.
The majority of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard. Shops consisted simply of counters open to the street. Stone was used for house building.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Old Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder. When he traveled further west, he found Greenland and gave it its name.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although all the countries were “Scandinavian”, there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That is not true, however. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words "original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776." The text is upside down on the bottom of the document.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (which measures 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage at the beginning of its life.
It is therefore possible that the notation was simply added as a label.
The landing on D-Day and the subsequent battles freed the north of France, but the south was still not free.
"It was ruled by the 'Vichy' French, who were Frenchmen who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the conquerors rather than fighting them."
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called “Operation Dragoon”.
After just two weeks, the Americans and the French liberation forces had freed the south of France and were heading towards Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state and also somehow defines the size of a society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and a proper diffusion.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as full-fledged civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the 13 states formed a weak central government based on the Articles of Confederation, consisting only of the Congress.
The Congress was not empowered to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on the states for enforcement of all its laws, which the states often did not cooperate with.
He also had no power to nullify tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so little seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful in the world, along with the German national football team, and was the FIFA World Champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions and Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic Games.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
"Because of the cluster/group of islands, Japan is often referred to geographically as an ""archipelago""."
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed by and documented the name of the island as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a settlement in southwestern Taiwan, which led to a change in the indigenous people's methods of cultivating crops and employed Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the government of the Qing Dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists mainly of three buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most widely used still image format in the world is 35mm, which corresponds to the predominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly, its image format was adopted by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
To be precise, the so-called 35 mm format measures confusingly 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore referred to as 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family, for example) have exactly the same or a very similar aspect ratio.
The much-maligned and often derided thirds rule is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while also preserving a sense of order in an image.
It states that the intersection point of the lines that divide an image vertically and horizontally is the most effective place for the main motif (see example).
In this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was put to the test.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had held the European states together despite different languages and customs.
His omnipotence controlled everyone, from the king to the common citizen.
One of the important Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the money of the churches exists for this very reason.
The central power of the Church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being upheld.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective, as it cut off the country from vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally recognized international law, codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire stretches of the sea, which posed a danger even to neutral ships.
As the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted U-boat warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolation were the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After the experience of the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take up a position at the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the USA with 4 cents in his possession, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of marking different ages. Each period in China and each family that was in power was a separate dynasty.
There were also periods of instability between the different dynasties, with the most famous of these periods being the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these times, bitter wars raged among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The time of the three kingdoms was one of the bloodiest epochs in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects like the use of the metric system, a move away from absolutism towards republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not just one ruler.
After the revolution, all professions were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and best could succeed.
The same was true for the military, as army rankings were now based on caliber instead of class membership.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was very interested in things beyond this everyday life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (light) to meditate.
The cave itself has survived the ages and offers a vivid picture of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not at all easy to find, even if you know it exists. Once you are in the cave, you are completely isolated.
You can see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. From the interior of the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Cheops pyramid is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Cheops pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Cheops' wives and family members.
The “spread” symbol looks like a V and the “swab” symbol looks like a bracket or a square with the bottom line missing.
Upward means you start at the top and push the bow. Downward means you start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Stroking usually generates a softer sound, while scraping is more forceful and expressive.
You are welcome to add your own pencil markings; however, remember that the printed bow markings are there for musical reasons, and should normally be respected.
The panic-stricken King Louis the XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, her two young children (the 11-year-old Marie-Therese and the 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris on October 6, 1789 by a mob of market women in Versailles.
They travelled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming mob of people who were making threats against the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages wide.
At some point, a member of the angry crowd held up the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the horrified queen.
The war expenses of the US imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover the bulk of expenses, and the interest from bonds flowed through the banking houses of Wall Street on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the superprofits derived from the ongoing exploitation of the Philippine people represented the fundamental gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, an era in European history that spans the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 CE).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a broad range of ideas in practice, from the technology push or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic that is linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: first, that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and second, that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are more inherent than socially conditioned.
One could argue that the development of roads is inevitably linked to the development of the passenger car.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The widespread ownership of automobiles also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong cultural determinist element, which drew on writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, it is geography that shapes individuals. Over time, customs and cultures emerged that were related to this geography and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, largely because the crusaders returned with gifts of silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine markets.
At this time, the title of the fashion capital of the world also moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th and the 14th century.
At the beginning, the clothing was heavily influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the east.
However, styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind due to the slow communication channels.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe slowly began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothing as a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence farming is agriculture that aims to produce just enough food to cover the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, farming method that uses saved, locally grown seeds and combines it with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries, this is still the case.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by societal norms, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differentiate themselves from others in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as such can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical in nature, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits, and jargon.
One of the most common methods of illustrating the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialized by adults during their childhood due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse.
"Such children are called ""feral"" or wild. Some feral children have been kept in captivity by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of the child was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's significant intellectual or physical limitations."
Wolf children may have experienced severe child abuse or traumatic experiences before being abandoned or running away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
If it was raised entirely by animals, the feral child will exhibit behaviors (within the limits of its physical abilities) that are almost entirely in line with those of its specific caregiver animal, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning is intended to make the learning process easier and more interesting, “scaffolding” goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a tool that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as when using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold, but so is the little paperclip guy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual help is built into the software and is intended to question, suggest and explain work steps that the student may not be able to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, loving, and education-oriented, but many are forced to do so.
For us, the system of foster care is a piece of security for these children.
Our foster care system is meant to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The foster home is supposed to cover all the needs that they did not get in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet connects both elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the utility and reward approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "sustained relationships" were also identified as new motivational factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important insights for the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting minimal changes in facial expression.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who can no longer understand language due to brain damage can still correctly assess the honesty of people.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation provides new genetic variations and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools back and forth with each generation.
Out in the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like ours to meet its amino acid requirements from available plant sources.
Furthermore, there are serious consequences if you fail to do so: growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
All in all, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to how chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Sleep inertia is the process of waking up during the normal sleep periods and falling asleep a short time (10-60 minutes) later.
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you're someone who hits snooze on your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so you're forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option is to drink a lot of liquid before bedtime (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effect), so that you are forced to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the degree of tension in the body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vitality. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded to include the path of love of the Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
At the center of Tibetan meditation is the god yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are opened, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the clash of systems, the course of events and culture led to the countries becoming enemies.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and was to be played out in reality by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already completely collapsed and the only hope was a retreat and a reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became almost obsolete overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union broke through the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts and created them after they had invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient method for transporting large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The traditional role of the navy was to ensure that a country remained able to transport people and goods, while at the same time impeding the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most significant recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II, where the Americans tried to get supplies and personnel across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Great Britain, just like the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran as early as about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them as livestock, in order to easily obtain their milk, fur, meat and skin.
House goats were normally kept in herds that roamed around hills or other grazing areas. The goats were looked after by goat herders, much like the more well-known sheep herders; often these were children or young people. These grazing methods are still used today.
As early as the 16th century, mining railways were built in England.
Although the rails were merely made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses that pulled the wagons to reach higher speeds and to pull larger loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
Thresholds were introduced quite early on to secure the position of the rails. However, gradually the realisation dawned that rails that carry a strip of iron are more efficient.
This became common, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carts.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first completely iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking. Humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means “upright man”).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as regularly.
Bipedal species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more sustainably, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate some of the future suffering.
In many cases, this is just like symptomatic treatment. However, if you don't want just temporary solutions, then we should find and treat the root of the problem.
It is really obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity, and that the problems caused by overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people have become more serious.
After its passage by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to the printing office of John Dunlap.
Over the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, which are now known as the "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript did not survive the times.
Many paleontologists today believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and still live today. We call them birds.
Many people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many things about birds still look like a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the processing of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately recognizable. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best sign of poisoning by swallowing may be the presence of an open container of medication or household chemicals.
Look on the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term is derived from the ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects that are very adaptable in parasitizing humans.
Both bed bugs and roach bugs are nidicolous, i.e. adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their hosts.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most widespread neurological disease in adults of younger and middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to raise a baby.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take on parenthood.
The main goal of science is to use the scientific method to figure out how the world works. This method is indeed the basis of most scientific investigations.
However, it is not just about experimentation, where an experiment is a test that serves to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by asking questions and conducting observations.
Natural scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts, and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted.
With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often based to a significant extent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.x
Cycle-specific behaviors that are not just reactions to signals from external cycles are known in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that even in the absence of external signals execute free-swinging cycles for a while.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments in which they either labeled the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a wide range of effects, depending on what type of mutation it is, what function the affected piece of genetic material has, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small provincial towns by car to drive to their workplace, and are passed by others whose workplace is in the place they have just left.
In this dynamic pendulum traffic, everyone is connected in some way to a transport system based on the private car, and supports it.
Science now shows that this massive carbon economy has taken the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has sustained human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.x
In developed countries, you're unlikely to hear many complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transport systems lead to such abuses, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are traffic engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on here?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult, as driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a reasonably consistent way, so traffic flows have a certain constancy and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important properties were defined: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design and operation of facilities on the roadway.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the skies. Their ability to fly helped them evade predators and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small hiding places in which to hide from predators.
Today, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the sun was at the center of the movements of the solar system.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), moved around the Earth.
That seems reasonable, as it doesn't feel like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and most water-rich river on earth. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, in some places up to six miles wide.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans via the planet's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon mainstream is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It takes water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical perfection of their construction.
Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican City has approximately 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to humans since ancient times, as they can all be found in their original form in nature and can be mined with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This corresponded more to the four states of matter (in order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. However, he also posited the theory that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The universe as a whole consists of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that billions of them would fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
Consequently, after its invention, the pencil became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the pencil has taken a back seat, so it has been pushed back in its status and use.
Nowadays people write messages on computer screens without ever having to come near a quill.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that energy is required to assemble a core with many protons and neutrons.
It's a bit like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. When the core splits again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they break down even with little or no provocation.
The surface of the moon consists of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the Mare and thicker under the highlands.
On the near side, there could be more Maria, as the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Theories of content focus on finding what moves or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized over the course of their adult development.
These theories deal with what makes certain people want to do exactly the things they do, and what influences in their environment cause them to do certain things or not to do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when managers start leading their former peers. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, enforcing discipline, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you turn into an unrecognisable individual who has to do everything differently to how the team did it and take everything as your own.
Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are managed to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams can meet across different time zones that local management may not consider.
The presence of a real “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"The ""invisible team"" is the leadership team, to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.x"
Why would an organization undertake the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organization? One goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized across all departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can flourish.
As a result, the collaborative work of an organization can lead to overcoming an obstacle to a new innovative process that meets customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must develop a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum concept as a method to help organizations become more efficient.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus delimiting the field of research and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, such as trauma, injury, and tumors, affect behavior and result in changes in some brain functions.
Emerging technologies are allowing us to see and study certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our head.
Although strongly associated with science fiction, AI is an important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of AI involves the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include control, the setting of strategies and timetables, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become independent disciplines, which focus on finding solutions to problems of real life.
The AI system is now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, and has also been integrated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every school class. It is not uncommon for a teacher to like to take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Virtual excursions are a technical solution. Students can view museum pieces, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art from the classroom.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. Although students often have poor grammar and spelling at the beginning of their blogging experience, this usually changes when there is an audience.
Since students are often a very critical audience, the blog author makes an effort to improve his writing style in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging “also forces students to learn more about the world around them.” The need to engage the audience inspires students to write intelligently and interestingly (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs “can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials, students can define their positions in relation to others’ texts and articulate their own perspectives on particular topics” (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital city, and is home to a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north lies the unspoiled beauty of nature in Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more make Ontario what outsiders consider to be typically Canadian.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the USA than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, in terms of its wildlife, a continent of its own.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or belong to France and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and it was very successful on the Comoros and in Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel zone and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers claim to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (just not one that looks too expensive.
Women should recognise that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider harassment, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm etc.
Stay consistent when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to defend your position (cultural differences aside; that doesn't mean it's okay!)
The present-day Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merinids, under the name of Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el Beida and it was called Casablanca by Spanish traders who set up trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan wares like tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes, and a whole range of tinnef, but it's all just for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is somewhat safe, any travel outside of Goma should be carefully planned to stay informed of the ongoing fighting in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
You can use bodabodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around in Goma. The usual (local) price is around 500 Congolese Francs for the short ride.
This, combined with its relative inaccessibility, has led to "Timbuktu" becoming a metaphor for exotic, far-off lands.
Although Timbuktu is known as a tourist attraction and has an airport, it is nowadays a poor city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the key locations for Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World".
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, because it has more of an Arab than an African flair.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa. It borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different animal world.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park charges daily conservation and entrance fees.
It may also be worth buying a Wild Card, which grants access to either selected parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the namesake of the territory of Hong Kong and is the focus of many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline were compared to a shimmering bar chart, visible through the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and drive to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists made their own. If you are looking for traces of the area's colonial past, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove belt in the world and extend over 80 km from the hinterland of Bangladesh and India to the coast.
The Sundarbans were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps – they also include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which a third is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans have been a nature reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer living there.
Buses run all day from the district bus station (on the other side of the river), with most buses, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leaving between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the buses between the districts are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Shared taxis offer a quick and comfortable way to get to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers are 83 meters high, its length is 378 meters and it has two lanes with a width of 3.50 m.
The clearance height under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction work was completed in August 2011, but the road was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs control points are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group that inhabited present-day eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called the Great Province of the West Indies, emerged in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonization period, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be watched here at other times of the year.
Information about competitions and sales points for polo tickets can be found at the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is fixed in line with the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West Store.
The British Pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and with Stanley credit cards. US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the remote islands, although British and US currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands themselves, so you should exchange your money before leaving the island.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. Temperatures over +30 °C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively chilly: Temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and moisture make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no pronounced rainy or dry seasons: the amount of rainfall remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the instructions of the park authorities, visitors should keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful bison, elk, moose, bears and practically all large animals may seem, it can happen that they attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance. These animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them plenty of space.
Also, be aware that smells can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strongly scented foods, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1750s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of an ignominious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships with the exception of a British cruiser were sunk. Almost 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the killing of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
As Auckland stretches over two harbours, there are many beaches. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe swimming and most offer shade provided by Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches, which can be crowded at times, with a nice shopping promenade along the coast. Swimming is safe here.
The most important local beer is “Number One”. It is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called “Manta”.
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines are perhaps more tolerable.
The local tap water is safe to drink, but if you are concerned, you can easily find bottled water.
"For Australians, the idea of coffee is foreign. A small black one is ""espresso"", cappuccino is filled high with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk."
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place throughout the year and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.x
Nevertheless, you should follow the advice of authorities, observe all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Jellyfish are present near the beach and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770, but can occasionally be found outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the sea, their primary habitat is in river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the certainty that he has a place to stay after his arrival at the destination.
Travel agencies often have arrangements with specific hotels, although you may also be able to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even a combination of flight and hotel.
You can also hold your reservation for you if you need time to review the offer or to obtain additional documents for your travel destination (e.g. Visa).
However, any changes or requests should be directed to the travel agency first, and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of attendees choose to camp on site, and most attendees consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to get there early to get a camping spot near the music.
Remember that on parts of the festival, music is played until late at night, even if the music on the main stages has stopped.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, as breaking ice can cause quite terrifying noise for those most affected.
The cruises to Saint Petersburg also offer time for a stay in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos generally go to great lengths to keep guests on the premises for as long as possible and to get them to spend as much money as possible. There are generally no windows or clocks, and exits are sometimes hard to find.
They usually have a special offer of food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests happy and make sure they stay.
Some venues offer free alcoholic drinks, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who wants to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes should expect snow, ice and temperatures below freezing point.
On icy and snowy roads, grip is low and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
In snowstorms, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you can get stuck.
Visibility can also be affected by falling or drifting snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
In common parlance, the term safari refers to a land journey to observe the overwhelming African animal world, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars closely, and the standard equipment allows for good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are often shy and you can observe them better with binoculars.
A foot safari (also called a “bush walk”, “walking safari” or “footing”) consists of a hike that lasts either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Olympic summer games, having already hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most cancellation policies did not extend through July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will cost between 2,500¥ and 130,000¥, with an average ticket costing around 7,000¥.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry faster. Many hotels will lend you an iron and ironing board, even if you're not in your room.
If an iron is not available or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (this can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, lead to burns).
There are various methods for cleaning water, some of which are more effective in counteracting certain hazards.
In some areas, it is enough to boil water for one minute, in others it must be several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies widely, and if you have concerns, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with from their home regions.
Pests can destroy food, cause irritation or, at worst, even trigger allergic reactions, administer poison or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases as such or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people are usually not classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travellers whose destination country has high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, particularly on products such as alcoholic drinks and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway is perhaps the greatest driving challenge, as it often passes through remote, undeveloped terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, stay alert: steep gradients, narrow roads and sharp bends predominate here.
The speed limits posted are noticeably lower than in the preceding and succeeding sections - generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict enforcement is even more important than usual.
Interestingly, cell phone coverage here is much better than in many other areas of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are quite tasty. In Bavaria, they are quite hearty and varied, as is the case with the southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples being baked into pastries year-round and cherries and plums used in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts or other nuts. Popular cakes often go particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to make small but rich pastries, then try what is called a Berliner, pancake or doughnut depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when the term is used without further attributes, it usually refers to the food that originally came from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, which is now widespread throughout the island group, offers a variety of simply seasoned dishes. Javanese people prefer peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut blossom sugar) and a range of aromatic spices as flavourings.
Stirrups are aids for the feet of riders, which hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They give the rider more stability, but there are safety concerns because the rider's feet may get caught in them.
If a rider falls off a horse and gets their foot caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse moves on. To minimise this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
In addition, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety buckles that allow a stirrup strap to fall from the saddle as soon as it is pulled back by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley – Chile’s premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a multitude of large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks offer a breathtaking view. Climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes along the walls, which offer endless possibilities.
Downhill sports such as skiing and snowboarding are popular sports where you attach skis or a snowboard to your feet and ride down a slope covered in snow.
Skiing is a popular activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan their entire vacation around skiing in one particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings with depictions of skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The origins of downhill skiing as a sport date back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Ski touring with a backpack: This activity is also called ski touring or ski mountaineering.
It is similar to alpine touring skiing or mountaineering, but does not necessarily include the latter, as the latter is performed on steep terrain and requires much firmer skis and boots.
Consider the ski route as a comparable hiking route.
In good conditions, you are able to cover slightly longer distances than when hiking – only very rarely will you reach the speed of cross-country skiing on groomed trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has numerous independent countries. Normally, you would have to apply for multiple visas and go through multiple passport controls if you wanted to travel through several countries.
The Schengen area, however, functions in this regard a bit like a country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the borders without having to go through passport control again.
Accordingly, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa separately for each of the Schengen member countries, which saves time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax authorities define antiques as goods over 100 years old.
The definition has geographic variations, with the age limit in places like North America potentially lower than in Europe.
Handmade products could be described as "antique" even though they are younger than similar products from mass production.
Reindeer husbandry is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many who work in other professions.
In the past, not all Sámi have bred reindeer on a large scale, but have lived from fishing, hunting and similar activities. They kept reindeer mainly as pack animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
"Even though the term 'gypsy' is used mainly by non-Roma, it is often perceived as offensive, as it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma."
If a travel advisory is issued for the country you will be visiting, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the advice of other governments than your own, but their advice is tailored to their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may be confronted with different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Briefings are merely a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general and, compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere, too simplistic.
Storm is the collective term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, severe social disruption or loss of life.
Storms can occur anywhere in the world and there are different types of storms that depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall and forest fires are forms and effects of storms, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, flash floods and hurricanes.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travellers are urged to be aware of any severe weather affecting their area as this may impact on all travel plans.
Anyone planning to travel to a country considered a war zone should undergo professional training for it.
"A Google search for 'course on hostile environments' is likely to reveal the address of a local company."
A course will usually cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course is usually between 2 and 5 days long and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are numerous books and journals on survival in the wilderness, but few publications on war zones.
Travellers planning gender-affirming surgery abroad must ensure they have valid travel documents to return home.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with unspecified gender (X) or documents updated to the desired name and gender is different.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents is also very different.
Security checks have also become much more intrusive in the time since September 11, 2001.
Transgender people before their operation should not expect their privacy and dignity to remain intact when passing through the scanners.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves breaking on the shore, often near reefs or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in a few deeper areas, and a fast current can form there, all the way down to deep water.
Most deaths occur from exhaustion while attempting to swim back against the current, which can prove impossible.
When you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than normal.
Try to get somewhere where you won't be caught again. Alternatively, depending on your abilities and whether you've been noticed, you might want to wait for rescue.
The reverse culture shock comes earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is not as pronounced), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travellers who found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to adapt back to their home culture.
When you come back home after an extended stay abroad, you have adapted to a different culture and have let go of some behaviors of your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travelers had to adjust to a new country.
One might not expect that patience and understanding are also required towards returning travellers.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and while it's quiet before the show starts.
Normally, you can always hear the sounds of tourists and vendors. The history of the sounds and lights is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as the background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are represented on the pyramids, with the different pyramids being illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most stations. In 2020, there were sixteen active ones.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands are Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworthland is the region south of the peninsula, which is bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge here into the plateau and then rise again to form the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak at 4892 m is Mount Vinson.
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a mobile phone, as you must be outside and in clear sight of a satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that require data and voice connections.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide further information on connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for people planning to take a year off is study and course offerings abroad.
This is particularly popular with school leavers, as it allows them to take a year off before university without affecting their studies.
In many cases, participating in a gap year abroad program can actually improve your chances of attending university in your home country.
As a rule, a tuition fee is charged for enrollment in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boating trips. The “Land of a Thousand Lakes” also has thousands of islands – in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
For the archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
While the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national leisure activity in Finland, with one in six or eight people owning a boat.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, the ratio is one to forty, for example).
Most pure Baltic Sea cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg in Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for several whole days, while returning to the ship in the evening to spend the night.
If you only go ashore during the course of the excursions, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises advertise Berlin, Germany as a destination in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and walks of life, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
There is no need to be ashamed of this: it is nothing more than the personal fears and antipathies that many people have.
Learning more about how planes work and what happens during a flight can help some people overcome the fear associated with the unknown or the feeling of not being in control.
Courier companies are well paid for the fast delivery of things. Often, time is a very important factor in business documents, merchandise or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies use their own planes, but on other routes and with smaller companies, difficulties arose.
If they shipped things via air freight, the unloading and customs clearance could take several days on some routes.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked baggage, but airline rules don't allow bags to be sent without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly in first or business class is to fork out a large amount of money for the privilege (or, better still, to get your company to foot the bill).
However, this is not cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class and eleven times for first class!
In general, it is pointless to search for discounts on direct flights from A to B, even for business or first-class seats.
The airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of fliers who are willing to pay a lot of money and demand corresponding prices for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The native language is Romanian, but many people also speak Russian.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of Moldova were restored.
The most important religion in Moldova is Christian Orthodox.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.
The once ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, progressive and busy business center, located on a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centres are characterised by classic red tile roofs, the 18th-century market and old mosques and churches, although the city exudes more of an atmosphere of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery there are interesting marble sculptures of doves on some graves.
It is worth taking half an hour to stroll through the fascinating village.
To the north and very close by is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after Lord Byron described its splendor in glowing colors.
The Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly from Cabo da Roca to Sintra.
Also visit the great sanctuary of Our Lady of the Rosary of Fatima (pilgrimage site) in the north - a place that is world-famous for its Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave site and a place that holds almost incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived their time here, and many more with relatives who were murdered there or worked to death, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this site with the dignity, reverence and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site by attaching or scratching graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as it is legally established as the first official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely spoken in public transport and other facilities.
Normal announcements in the metro are made exclusively in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are reported by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are said to be self-centered, rude and arrogant.
Even if this is often just an inaccurate cliché, one finds oneself in Paris best when one shows oneself from one's best side and behaves like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-bred). This will make getting along much easier.
The brusque exterior of Parisians disappears very quickly when they display basic manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily wooded, with mainly beech, fir and pine trees, and offers a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to its numerous microclimates, different soils and alternating altitudes, it has a remarkably large variety of plant communities.
The area is also home to an extremely large variety of animal and bird species.
There are rare fauna such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wildcats and capercaillies, as well as many species that are generally more common.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that reach above the knee and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries do have wraparound skirts for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will give you a smile.
Similarly, men must wear trousers that reach above the knee.
These can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after every user, so you may not feel comfortable in these skirts. There is a one-size-fits-all for all men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that in similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and always uses olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any ingredient that is available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
"All nouns, in addition to the word Sie for ""you"", always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence."
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It does make reading easier, but writing is somewhat difficult because you have to determine whether a verb or adjective is used as a main word.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
"Also make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means ""dear"" whereas carro means ""chariot""."
The Persian language has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introductory grammar would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
If you speak a Romance language, it is of course easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak some Spanish might be too quick to conclude that Portuguese is so similar that it doesn't need to be learned separately.
Pre-modern observatories are no longer in operation today and serve as museums or educational sites.
As light pollution was not the problem it is today during their heyday, they are usually located in cities or on university grounds that are easier to access than those built more recently.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Viewing cherry blossoms, known as Hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept comes from China, where peach blossoms are the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the nobility in the vicinity of the imperial court.
"Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even ""just one"" specimen."
If you visit a formally laid out garden and collect "samples", you will also be thrown out without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to be, and after arriving, you can buy almost anything.
As you are in the extreme tropics and only a few degrees north of the equator, you should expect both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
There are also a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Make sure the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good basis for holiday planning.
For example, castle tours in the Loire Valley, in the Rhine Valley or a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also represent popular hiking and cycling routes.
In Christianity, Christmas is one of the most important holidays and is considered the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the festival have also been adopted by non-believers all over the world, in both Christian and non-Christian countries.
There is a tradition of spending the night of Easter at some open spot to watch the sunrise.
There are of course Christian-theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with the celebrations of the communities often beginning at midnight, in which the resurrection of Christ is celebrated.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying or washing up on shore.
Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the main herbivore on the Galapagos Islands.
Since the first humans set foot on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky is more or less dark around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you can also enjoy the starry sky.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners might be used to.
Suits are common business attire and colleagues address each other by their family names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is of critical importance, with the focus being more on group performance than on praise for individual achievements.
Often, employees must seek approval from their superiors for all decisions they make, and they are expected to unconditionally follow the instructions of their bosses.
