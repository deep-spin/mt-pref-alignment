"Right now, we have four-month-old mice that used to be diabetic and are no longer diabetic," he added.
The research is still in its early stages, according to Dr. Ehud Ur, a professor in the medical school at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and director of the clinical and scientific department of the Canadian Diabetes Association.
Like other experts, he is sceptical about whether diabetes can be cured and stresses that these findings are not relevant to those already suffering from type 1 diabetes.

USA Gymnastics supports the statement of the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes that it is imperative that the Olympic family fosters a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of athletes, clubs and their sports can be best served by moving forward with significant changes within our organization, rather than by withdrawing certifications.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that can shed light on how the abuse of the proportion that the survivors of Larry Nassa described with such courage could have gone unnoticed for so long and accepts any necessary and appropriate changes.
The goal of USA Gymnastics and the USOC is the same: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a protected, positive and empowered environment.
During the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as an advisor and later for the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.
He advised Carter on foreign policy in the 1976 election. He then served as National Security Advisor (NSA) from 1977 to 1981, succeeding Henry Kissinger.

In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, a theory already widely accepted, it also provides specific data that fossils generally do not offer, such as their color and three-dimensional structure.
According to experts, this animal has a chestnut-colored plumage on the upper part and a pale or carotenoid tone on the lower part.
Furthermore, the finding allows us to better understand the evolution of bird feathers.
Given that the plumage of dinosaurs does not have a well-developed axis, called the rachis, but does have other features of feathers (barbules and barbs), the researchers concluded that the rachis is likely the result of a later evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the plumage suggests that its function was not related to flight, but that it was used to regulate temperature or as a temperature indicator. The researchers maintain that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample analyzed shows features of the plumage of an adult and not of a chick.
The experts' assessments were that, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample illustrates the plumage of an adult more than that of a chick.

It warns that no one can guarantee that any Iraqi action at this point will stop sectarian strife, rising violence or a slide into chaos.
The report begins with a call for open debate and consensus-building in the United States about policies on the Middle East.
The report is highly critical of virtually every aspect of the current policy of the executive branch in Iraq, and calls for an immediate change in direction.
It contains 78 recommendations, the number one of which is the adoption of a new initiative before the end of the year with the aim of protecting Iraq's borders from hostile operations and to restore diplomatic ties with its neighbors.
Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who currently holds the position of senator and is the first lady of the Argentine Republic, announced last night in La Plata, a city located 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires, that she will run for the presidency.

Although it was an eminently theoretical work, the program was written with the aim of simulating the observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
It would be the tidal forces between the dark matter present in the galaxy and that of the Milky Way that would cause the effect expected by the group of scientists.
The Milky Way influences the Sagittarius galaxy in the same way that the moon exerts a force of attraction on our planet and causes the tides.
The experts came to the conclusion that dark matter affects each other just like regular matter does.
This theory holds that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located around it in a kind of halo and is made up of numerous small particles.

Extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was first detected by Dr. Tony Moll in the South African area of Zululandia.
During an interview, he pointed out that the new variant generated “a lot of concern and alarm, given its high mortality rate”.
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have contracted the virus within the hospital and that at least two of the infected were healthcare workers at that hospital.
In a year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 people with whom they have had close contact.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the total group of tuberculosis patients still seems to be low: 6000 out of a total of 333,000 infected individuals at a particular time in South Africa.

The authorities have also secured several million doses of the vaccine against encephalitis, which will allow healthcare providers to prepare for next year.
This year, the shortage of monetary resources and the low priority given to it, compared to other diseases, have caused delays in the implementation of the vaccine delivery plans in the historically most vulnerable regions.

As can be seen from the infrared images, the temperature variations during the day and night indicate that they are probably caves.
During the day, its temperature is lower than that of the surrounding surface and, at night, higher.
"While its thermal behavior is not as regular as the large caves on our planet, which usually maintain a fairly stable temperature, it is consistent with these deep cavities in the ground," said Glen Cushing, of the archaeology team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the University of Northern Arizona, in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, elections have traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a cubicle and insert a pre-printed sheet indicating the candidate they have chosen into an envelope.
After officials verify the identity of the person who comes to vote, they place the envelope in the ballot box and sign the list of voters.
French electoral law establishes the procedures quite strictly.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes have had to be transparent, which allows voters and observers to verify that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the voting process and that no others are added that are not those of those who vote, duly counted and authorized.
The candidates have the power to send representatives to monitor each stage of the process and, during the night, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision and in accordance with specific procedures.

To me it seemed like that didn't make sense; it definitely wasn't fair.
The only thing I tell people is that you treat us the same way we treat you.
A bill was passed by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger that does not allow the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.
The bill provides that violent video games sold in the state of California must be labeled with a sticker bearing the legend “18” and penalizes their sale to minors with a fine of $1000 for non-compliance.
The Director of Public Prosecutions, Kier Starmer QC, made a statement this morning confirming that Huhne and Pryce would be put on trial.
Huhne has resigned, and Ed Davey MP will replace him in the cabinet. Norman Lamb MP is expected to take up the post of business minister that Davey is vacating.
February 16 is the date on which Huhne and Pryce are scheduled to appear before the Westminster Magistrates Court.
Nicholas Alden and Zachary Cuddeback, aged 25 and 21 respectively, died. The latter was driving.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider required facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's gun jammed as he aimed it at the head of a fifth man. Schneider suffers permanent pain, cannot see with one of his eyes, is missing part of his skull and his face had to be reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider testified via a virtual link from a U.S. Air Force base in his home country.
Carpanedo participated in two individual races of the championship apart from the Wednesday competition.
The first was the slalom, in which he got a "Did Not Finish the first race", as did 36 of the 116 participants in that race.
In her other event, the giant slalom, she came in tenth place in the women's sitting group with a combined execution time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first Austrian finalist, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth finalist, Gyöngyi Dani, from Hungary.
Four female skiers in the sitting category failed to complete their races and a total of 45 of 117 participants in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify for the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police force was able to recover the stolen laptop and cell phone.
The additional inspector general, D.K. Arya, stated: "We have arrested five individuals who abused the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
Baba, Bhutha, Rampro, Gaza and Vishnu Kanjar are the defendants.
According to the superintendent of police, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused appeared before the court with their faces covered.
Despite the fact that there were three people inside the house at the time of the car impact, none of them suffered any injuries.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services removed the driver of the red Audi TT from inside.
At first, he was taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court, charged with the murder of her son.
While she is in custody awaiting charge and trial, any statement from an eyewitness may be questionable, as her image has been widely circulated.
It is common practice in other parts of the UK, but as Scottish justice works differently, the courts considered the publication of photographs to be potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee said: "It appears that journalists are treading on dangerous ground when they publish photos or other information about suspects."
The Crown Office, which is in charge of the prosecutions, told reporters that no further comment would be made at least until the indictment is issued.
According to the information that was leaked, the document will deal with the border conflict, which Palestine intends to resolve based on the borders that were in place prior to the Middle East War of 1967.
Other topics that were also addressed, as reported, include the future status of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while the PA only accepts five.
During the supplementary pest control trial, the forest rangers had to closely supervise the shooters, as this was monitored and evaluated for its effectiveness.
In a partnership between NPWS and the NSW Field and Game Association Inc., suitable volunteers were recruited from the Association's hunting program.
Mick O'Flynn, who is in charge of the NPWS Parks Conservation and Heritage office on an interim basis, said the four shooters chosen for the shooting operation received comprehensive safety training and instruction.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in to a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
In four years, it is the fifth CEP of Martelly.
Last month, a presidential commission advised the previous CEP to resign, as part of a series of measures aimed at leading the country towards new elections.
The commission was how Martelly responded to the widespread demonstrations that began in October against the regime.
The demonstrations, sometimes violent, were caused by the fact that elections have not been held in some cases since 2011.
Nearly 60 cases of iPods with problems of overheating and malfunction have been reported, which caused six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported having recorded 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company categorized as "not serious."
The ministry commented on the delay in Apple's report, saying it was something "truly regrettable".
Mariana was hit by an earthquake at 7:19 local time (21:19 GMT) on Friday.
The emergency management agency of the Northern Mariana Islands indicated that there were no reports of damage in the national territory.
Likewise, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported the absence of tsunami indicators.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former police officer from that country hijacked a bus and held tourists from Hong Kong captive.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 against the foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued and, so far, it has been confirmed that at least six have died.
Both the six hostages, including children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers were released early.
Later, the photographers took the place of an elderly woman who needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began studying medicine.
She trained in obstetrics and entered employment with Auckland National Women's Hospital around 1959.
Liggins began his research into premature birth in his spare time while working at the hospital.
Their study showed that the fetal lung maturation of the baby could be accelerated through the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday, government investigators managed to recover the flight recorders from the black box.
Luna's fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to him.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of the Extreme. She died on the night of the two moons, something unique, like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Diamond" Runnels said: "Luna was as weird as me; even more so. I love her and I will miss her. I hope she finds herself in a better place."
Since 2008, among the 1400 surveyed prior to the 2010 federal elections, there has been an 8% growth in those who oppose Australia becoming a republic.
Julia Gillard, the interim prime minister, said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic once the reign of Queen Elizabeth II was over.
34% of those surveyed share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last queen Australia has.
At one end of the survey are 29% of people who believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; at the other, 31% who believe that it should never do so.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games but his fitness has been thrown into doubt by his complaints.
He has not been able to take painkillers, because their use is prohibited in the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever known.
Many people verified the finding using various types of hardware and software and it was reported in early February and made public on Tuesday.
Possibly, comets served as a source of water supply for our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the ability to form proteins and sustain life.
The expectation of the scientists is to understand how planets originate, in particular ours, since the comets crashed into the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor at the beginning of the year and last month signed a bill allowing people of the same sex to marry.
He called the rumors “political gossip and nonsense”.
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, would reduce the distances of air routes, which would save millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, in contrast to the old ground-based radar technology, in order to enable air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater accuracy and provide more accurate data to pilots.
No additional transport will be implemented and trains will not stop at Wembley. Car parking and deterrent will not be available.
Due to concerns over the lack of transportation, the possibility of playing the game behind closed doors, without the team's fans, was considered.
On Thursday, the journal Science published a study reporting the appearance of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Experts from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden have revealed that the new species managed to evolve in just two generations, even though it was estimated that it would take much longer, due to the reproduction between an endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and a migrating cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can take on all sorts of shapes and be wound into tiny figures.
Not only can it be hammered and rolled into sheets, but it is also possible to stretch it to create very fine wire that can be twisted and braided.
It can be made very thin and adhered to another metal. It is so thin that it was used to decorate hand-drawn illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make a pH indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of the cabbage juice will be altered depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) present in the chemical being tested determines its pH level.
Hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron, so a hydrogen ion is the result of stripping a proton of its electron.
Shake both dry powders together and then, with clean, wet hands, squeeze them together to form a ball.
A reaction will occur between the moisture in your hands and your outer layers, which will feel strange to the touch and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house, which were connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
In some homes in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, remains of sewer systems were found.
They also had toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, public baths had toilets and some were shared by men and women.
When one communicates with someone who is thousands of miles away, one is making use of a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space via a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, as the light from the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and the view we have.
A giant rocket, more than 100 feet tall, is needed to get a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in surprising ways. The most important thing it has done for us is to provide us with much simpler and faster transportation.
Thanks to her, today we have many means of transportation, such as the train or the automobile, among many others.
Below them, there are more moderate-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including independent domestic cats) that feed on small species that exist in much greater numbers, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche: each feline has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all felines and their lives are spent within large groups called prides.
The herds are formed by one to three adult males from the same family group, joined by up to thirty females and their offspring.
Females usually relate closely to each other, making them a large family of sisters and daughters.
Prides of lions have the same behaviour as wolves or dogs, with whom they share a surprising similarity (unlike other big cats) both in their behaviour and in that they are highly lethal to their prey.
An all-round athlete, the tiger has the ability to climb (but not too well), swim, make long jumps and pull five times harder than a robust person.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These are the only four felines capable of roaring.
The tiger's is not a fully sonorous roar like the lion's, but rather a sentence of grunts and screams.
Ocelots enjoy feeding on small creatures. If possible, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all of their prey will be much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) through their sense of smell, by smelling the ground where they have passed.
They have very good night vision and in dark places, and they also move very quietly. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) moves away from the main population they came from (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so they can't easily go back), they will often find themselves in an environment that is different from what they were used to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors, and therefore a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than it had before to be a strong competitor.
No changes have occurred in the original population, which still require the same adaptations as in the past.
As time goes by, as the incipient population adapts to the new environment, it begins to resemble the other population less and less.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that it will not be possible to classify them as the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an inevitable consequence and fundamental part of evolution.
Plants generate the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale.
The food of plants is generated with solar energy, thanks to photosynthesis. In addition, they offer us shade.
We build our houses from plants and with them we also make clothes. Most of the food we eat is from plants. Without them, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, so it feared nothing, except for others of its own species.
Its long jaws had more than 70 knife-like teeth embedded in them, as well as an additional set in the palate, meaning that anything that came in front of it had no escape.
We don't have the evidence, but it could have been a viperine. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it could even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked any creature that entered the water: not even a dinosaur as huge as the T. Rex was a threat to it.
While most of that food would be quite familiar to us, the Romans also ate certain unconventional items at banquets, such as wild boar, peacocks, snails, and even a type of rodent, the mole.
Another thing that set them apart was that humble people and women ate sitting on a chair, while the wealthy enjoyed sharing banquets and lying on their side while eating.
It is not possible that the recipes of ancient Rome included foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a central temple for each of their gods, which was considered their home.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests sought to meet their needs by holding ceremonies and festivals.
The temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers called zigurats were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower constituted a special sanctuary for their deity.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not of major importance.
Hebrew families spent most of their time outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were just counters that opened onto the street. The houses were built with stone.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests; therefore, wood was extremely expensive.
Very few people lived in Greenland. According to the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a journey he undertook further west, he discovered the island and gave it its name.
Nevertheless, despite their discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living in the area at that time.
While each country on its own was "Scandinavian," there were marked differences in people, monarchs, habits, and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you may believe that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. While the back of the document does contain something written on it, it is not a treasure map.
The Declaration of Independence has written on its reverse side the phrase "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text is located at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that it was barely finished, the enormous parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Therefore, it is likely that the annotation was added merely as a label.
While the landings carried out during D-Day, as well as the subsequent clashes, had achieved the liberation of northern France, the southern side still remained.
His government was in the hands of the Vichy French, who were a group that, in 1940, had agreed to peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the so-called "Operation Dragon" was deployed, through which the Allies invaded southern France.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were headed towards Germany.
A civilization can be defined as a specific culture that is part of an extensive group of people who live and work together; that is, a society.
The term civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, and is related to the word civis, also from the same language, which means citizen, as well as to civitas, which means city or city-state and which, in addition, determines the size of society in some way.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A culture of civilization entails a prolonged generational transmission of knowledge, a lasting cultural legacy, and a homogeneous spread.
Minority cultures tend to disappear without leaving significant historical traces, and they fail to be recognized as civilizations in their own right.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which Congress was its only component.
Congress had no power to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, this function fell to state authorities, who often did not cooperate in enforcing all of its laws.
Nor was he empowered to override tax laws or tariffs between states.
The articles demanded the unanimous approval of all states to proceed with their amendment and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives often stayed away.
The Italian national football team, along with the German team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the sports that are most practiced are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice skating, roller skating and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern areas, with athletes participating in international tournaments and Olympic events.
Japan has around 7000 islands (the largest is Honshu), which makes it the seventh largest archipelago in the world.
Due to the conglomerate/group of islands it contains, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors who sailed through the area recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, that is, beautiful island.
The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch East India Company, of a base in southwestern Taiwan, marked the beginning of a transformation in the aboriginal method of grain production, with the use of Chinese labor to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing dynasty (1644-1912) army took control of the northern and western coastal region of Taiwan in 1683 and declared the latter as a province dependent on the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government adhered to the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, who retained control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main constructions: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the ends of the complex have been reconstructed in order for tourists to be able to see what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had already been restored and work continues to this day.
To give an example, the most common format of still photography worldwide is 35 mm, which was the most widely used film size towards the end of the era of analogue films.
Today it is still being produced, but more importantly its dimensional relationship has been translated into the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Actually, the 35 mm format is somewhat confusing, as its dimensions are 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
Therefore, the dimensional ratio of this format (divide by twelve to calculate the simplest ratio of integers) is said to be 3:2.
Many typical formats (e.g. the group of APS formats) are the same or very similar to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been the subject of constant ridicule and often mocked, is a simple guideline that generates dynamism while also allowing a certain order to be imposed on the images.
It indicates that the most effective position to place the central object is the intersection formed by the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of Europe's history, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was challenged.
For more than a millennium, Christianity had managed to unite the European states despite their different languages and customs.
Its power, present everywhere, affected everyone, from the monarch to the common people.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds are reserved for that specific function.
The central dome of the church had remained in Rome for more than a millennium and this concentration of power and money made many wonder if this principle was being respected.
Shortly after hostilities broke out, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
While the strategy, which involved the disruption of vital military and civilian supplies, was successful, the measure violated generally recognized international law and was contemplated in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Great Britain extracted international waters in entire sectors of the ocean to block the entry of ships, even putting neutral vessels at risk.
Having received a muted response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
Throughout the 1920s, the attitude adopted by most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, countries wanted to prevent such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the US to take up a job with the Edison company in New York.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his manager at his last job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of delineating different periods of time. Each stage or each family in power constituted a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with divided provinces. The most well-known was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years, between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these stages, a bloody war broke out between many nobles who were disputing the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China was the Three Kingdoms period, where thousands of people died in a struggle to occupy the throne of the grand palace in Xi'an.
Its political and social consequences are many, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single sovereign.
Also, after the Revolution, the posts were open to all male candidates, which allowed the most ambitious and prestigious to succeed.
The same is true of the military, as instead of basing army ranks on classes, they are now based on calibre.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to face their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He used to visit a cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) to reflect.
The cave itself, which has endured over time, illustrates very realistically the spiritual inclinations of Mohammed.
At the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca lies a cave completely abstracted from the rest of the planet.
Indeed, it is very difficult to find, even if one were sure of its existence. Inside the cave, the isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen other than the wonderful clear sky and the numerous mountains surrounding it. From the inside of this cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
Of the seven wonders, the only one still standing is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptian people in the 3rd century BC, is one of many large, pyramid-shaped structures built to venerate the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in the Valley of the Dead, in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many others of this type, smaller tombs and temples were built in honor of his wives and family members.
The "upward arch" mark resembles a V and the "downward arch" mark is similar to a staple or a square without its bottom edge.
Up means that you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means that you should start at the handle, where the hand holds the bow, and pull it.
The upward movement of the bow generates a softer sound, while a downward movement is stronger and more decisive.
Feel free to make your own marks with pencil, but remember that the marks on the bow instruments have been printed there for a musical purpose and should therefore be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a mob of market women forced the terrified monarch Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, eleven years old, and Louis Charles, four) and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd shouting and making threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At one point, a rioter shook the head of an executed royal guard in front of the queen, who was in a panic.
The Filipino people themselves paid the war costs of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime in order to cover most of the expenses and interests of the bonds that fluctuated on behalf of the Philippine government in the banks of Wall Street.
From now on, the super profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the main profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that gave rise to the establishment of the order.
The European historical period in which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, between the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (i.e. between the years 1000 and 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that pragmatically comprises a wide range of ideas, from the technological impulse or imperative to a strict sense that there is an underlying logic that drives the destiny of humanity and that is related to the laws of science and how they are embodied in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development in itself unfolds along a path independent of any cultural or political influence and that, at the same time, technology has “effects” on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
To give an example, one could argue that the existence of automobiles necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national network of roads is not economically viable for a small volume of cars, so new manufacturing techniques are being designed to reduce the costs of owning a vehicle.
The massive use of automobiles also generates a higher incidence in traffic accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very present in Romanticism, according to scholars such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people and, over time, customs and cultures related to that geography developed that, being in harmony with the location of that society, were preferable to laws that were imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is known as the city of fashion today, Constantinople was considered as such in feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 B.C. and lasted until around 1100 A.D.
During the 12th century its status declined, mainly because, on their return, the crusaders brought back gifts, such as silks and spices, which were given greater value than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
The title of "fashion capital" was then passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The pinnacle of Gothic style took place in the period between the X-XI and XIV centuries.
At first, the way of dressing was greatly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of the communication channels, Western styles could be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant advances of that time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is understood to be that which aims to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his or her family group exclusively.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, generally organic practice that combines the use of stored seeds native to the ecological region with crop rotation or other comparatively simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, a farmer's main activity was subsistence farming, which is still practiced in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginalization by social standards and provide them with the possibility of generating a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location or gender of their members.
The traits that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographic, or related to religion or politics, or a mix of factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to exhibit traits of their belonging to it by resorting to the distinctive and symbolic use of style, such as fashions, gestures and jargon.
One of the most commonly used mechanisms to illustrate the importance of socialization is to analyze the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to negligence, misfortune or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
These children are nicknamed “wild children”. Some wild children are confined by people, usually their parents. In some cases, a child is abandoned due to the parents’ rejection of the child’s severe intellectual or physical disability.
It is possible that the feral children suffered traumatic situations or severe child abuse before being abandoned or running away.
It is said that others were raised by animals and that some have lived on their own in the wild.
When the wild child is raised exclusively by animals other than humans, he exhibits behaviors (within his physical capabilities) almost entirely similar to those of the specific animal that cared for him, as well as his fear or indifference towards people.
Even though project-based learning should facilitate this process and make it more interesting, the framework goes a bit further.
Scaffolding is not a learning technique; rather, it is an assistance that provides support to those who are going through a new experience, such as the use of a new computer program or the start of a new project.
The scaffold can be presented in both real and virtual formats; in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffold, but so is the animated paper clip in Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolds are incorporated into the software and their function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have been complex for the student on their own.
Children are taken into care homes for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment where there is no love, care and education; but it happens.
We can perceive that the system of family fostering provides a safe environment for these children.
The goal of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, consistent education, and reliable medical care.
The objective of family fostering is to cover all the needs that were not being met in the home from which they were previously taken.
The Internet unites and mixes components of mass communication and communication between people.
The different features of the Internet open up new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as significant incentives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
During a study of user reactions to websites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), "personal involvement" and "lasting relationships" were also identified as new motivational factors.
Through the recording of videos, important findings have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are movements in the face that last only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is argued that, through the proper reading of their microexpressions, it is possible to detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained how those who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can nevertheless assess sincerity accurately.
It even suggests that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
Through the research work of the 20th century, it has been demonstrated that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
The mutation process incorporates a new genetic variation; the selection process removes it from that set of variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variation from one generation to the next.
In the savannah, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is the same as that of humans, to satisfy its amino acid needs with the plant resources available.
In fact, not doing so entails serious problems: slowed growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The proteins present in leaves and legumes would have constituted the most easily accessible source of plant resources, but they are not easily digestible for primates like us, except if they are cooked.
In contrast, animal-derived foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest while providing a large number of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
In short, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problems" in much the same way as savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption consists of intentionally waking up during the normal sleep period and falling asleep after a while (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved with a more or less gentle alarm clock that brings you back to a conscious state, although without waking you up completely.
Registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you will need to register your presence and the address of your accommodation with the local authorities.
Other options based on the biological rhythm consist of drinking a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before going to bed, which will force you to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace that a person enjoys is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force we have to count on. Each of us has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
We can all reach enlightenment. The only thing that obstructs the path is our tension and negativity.
While the foundations of Tibetan Buddhism are the teachings of Buddha, it has expanded to include the Mahayana path of love and numerous yoga techniques from India.
In general terms, Laism is very simple. It is based on Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that encompasses everything.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment) is activated with yoga positions, breathing practices, mantras or visualizations.
Tibetan meditation focuses on Devata Yoga. Through the visualization of different deities, energy channels can be unblocked, chakras can be activated, and the awareness of enlightenment can be developed.
Cooperation between the USSR and the USA was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during World War II. After the war, clashes of system, process and culture eventually distanced the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, those who were allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would extend over the next 40 years and be fought for real, through surrogate militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other places.
As by September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, their only hope was to retreat and reorganize on the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight when more than 800,000 Red Army combatants from the Soviet Union entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the regions of eastern Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The function of the navy has always been to ensure that its country retains the ability to transport its population and goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The North Atlantic campaign in World War II provides one of the clearest and most recent examples of this. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean in order to support Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, tried to neutralize this traffic.
If the Allies had not been successful, Germany could have taken over power in Great Britain, just as it did with the other European countries.
Apparently, goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
In order to easily obtain their milk, hair, meat and leather, ancient peoples and tribes began to keep them.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goat herders who were often children or teenagers, similar to the more popular shepherd. These methods of herding are still used today.
In England, train tracks had already been installed by the 16th century.
Even though the rails of the carts were made of simple parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses that pulled them to achieve greater speed and to drag heavier loads than on the slightly more treacherous roads of the day.
The incorporation of sleepers to keep the rails in place occurred quite early on. However, gradually, they realised that the rails would be more efficient if they were coated in iron on their upper part.
This became a common practice, although the iron caused greater wear on the wheels of the wagons, which were made of wood.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones, and in 1767, solid iron rails began to be used.
The first form of transportation that was known was walking. Humans began to do it upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking upright.
While traces of bipedalism have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can start living a more planet-friendly life, join environmental movements, or even become activists and fight to mitigate future suffering to some extent.
It is, in many cases, like treating the symptoms without treating the cause. But if we are not just looking for a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and try to eliminate them.
It is clear that the world has undergone great changes, as a result of humanity's technological and scientific advances, and problems have intensified due to overpopulation and people's extravagant lifestyles.
After being approved by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent to the printing office of John Dunlap, a few streets away, signed by the president of Congress, John Hancock, and the secretary, Charles Thomson.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, which are now known as the "Dunlap Copies".
It was John Nixon who first read the document, and he did so in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on July 8.
On July 6, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered it to be read to his army in New York on July 9. Another copy arrived in London on August 10.
Dunlap's 25 prints, known to still exist, are the oldest copies of the document known to exist. The original manuscript is lost.
A large number of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. They are the birds.
Many people don't picture them as dinosaurs, since they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many features in birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have scaly limbs with claws, lay eggs and move on their hind legs like the T-Rex.
Currently, almost all computers operate on the basis of manipulating data encoded under the binary system.
A binary number can only have one of two values, they are 0 and 1 and, according to computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately evident. Its symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common to allow for an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning may be finding an open bottle of medicines or toxic chemical cleaning products.
Read the label for specific first aid information for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term parasitic insect in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its ancient relationship with bedbugs, a species that has evolved to parasitize humans.
Kissing and bed bugs are nidicolous; they are adapted to inhabit the nest or home of their host.
The number of reported cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the U.S. is around 400,000, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, the junction of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve, is the target of multiple sclerosis.
Studies have indicated that women are twice as likely as men to suffer from MS.
A couple might conclude that raising a baby would not be the best thing for them or the child.
These couples could choose to plan the adoption of a baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
The ultimate goal of science is to decipher how the world works through the scientific method. Indeed, this method serves as a guide for most scientific research.
It is not, however, an experiment, it is a test that is used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations that guide scientific research.
The focus of both naturalists and philosophers was on the classical works; especially, on the Latin version of the biblical text.
The thoughts of Aristotle, especially the issues of science, even psychology, were accepted.
As the mastery of the Greek language declined, the West became increasingly distant from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Often, many rhythms present in physiological processes and in behavior depend decisively on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just reactions to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate in a self-sustained manner and have a free cyclic operating period, even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that DNA consisted of genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacterium using phages, or viruses.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the DNA protein with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation can have various effects.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while those that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism usually attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, which includes animal and plant wildlife.
Some examples of possible activities at the site are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystem information.
An example is visiting, taking photographs and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to work and often cross paths with others whose jobs are in the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to a transportation system based on the use of private cars, and they support it.
Currently, scientists argue that this massive carbon economy has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states that has contributed to the evolution of humanity for the last two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems; and almost everyone complains about them.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transport systems give rise to complaints of this calibre and why do failures occur daily? Are transport engineers simply incapable? Or is there something more substantial going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is not a simple task to study traffic flow, as it is not possible to make exact predictions about the behavior of drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency for drivers to maintain relatively consistent behaviour, which allows traffic flows to have a logical consistency and can be the subject of approximate mathematical representation.
In order to more clearly depict the flow of circulation, relationships were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships facilitate both the planning and design and the operation of the road devices.
The first species to take flight were insects. This helped them to evade their enemies more easily and to find food and a mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back, attaching them to the sides of their body.
This provides them with a larger range of possible small places to hide from predators.
Currently, anisopterans and ephemeropterans are the only insects incapable of folding their wings.
Millennia ago, a man named Aristarchus commented that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system orbited the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since on Earth we don't perceive its movement, right?
The Amazon River is the most voluminous and the second longest on the planet. It contains 8 times more water than the next largest river.
In addition, the Amazon is the widest river on the planet, in some places with a width of up to six miles.
Of the total water from the world's rivers that flows into the oceans, 20 percent comes from the Amazon.
The great Amazon River has a length of 6,387 km (3,980 miles) and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, they could never surpass those of Giza, either in size or in the sublime technique of their construction.
The ancient Egyptian New Kingdom town was amazed by the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time dated back more than a millennium.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, the Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the one with the smallest population.
Italian is used in Vatican City, both to draft its legislation and to issue its official communications.
The language that most people who work within the state speak on a daily basis is also Italian and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
All citizens living in Vatican City adhere to the Roman Catholic religion.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known since ancient times, as they can all be found in their original form in nature and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
The philosopher Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more similar to the states of matter (with the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, only that, at the same time, he had the theory that they transform into new substances that make up the things we see.
Alloys are basically a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. In addition, there are also metals such as gold and silver.
It is also possible that there are alloys with the presence of small amounts of elements, such as carbon, that are not metallic.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, composed of small particles called atoms.
The size of atoms is so impressively tiny that the period at the end of this sentence could contain billions of them.
Therefore, when it was invented, the pencil gained many friends.
Unfortunately, with the implementation of new writing methods, the pencil is used less and has lost its status.
Nowadays, people write messages on the screens of their computers. They don't even need to get close to a typewriter.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb operates on the principle that energy is required to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's similar to what happens when you drive a heavy truck up a hill. By splitting the nucleus once more, it releases some of that energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable, that is, they tend to break down with a minimum or almost no push.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
It is possible that there are more seas on the near side because its crust is thinner, which made it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what attracts or pleases people.
These doctrines hold that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grew to maturity.
These theories analyze what causes certain people to want to do the things they do and what factors in their environment compel them to do or not do certain things.
Two very well-known theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, there can be two types of behavior when managers start leading their former peers. On one end of the spectrum is the attempt to continue being "one of the guys" (or girls).
Managers in this category struggle to make decisions that are unpopular with employees, impose disciplinary measures, conduct performance evaluations, assign responsibilities, and hold staff accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, they mutate into an unrecognizable person who believes it necessary to change everything that the group has been doing up to now and do it their way.
After all, the ultimate person responsible for the team's success and failure is the leader.
This way of behaving often ends up distancing the leaders from the other members of the team.
The same standards of excellence that apply to conventional teams apply to virtual ones, although there are small differences.
Often, members of a virtual team act as a point of contact for their nearest physical group.
They generally enjoy greater autonomy than members of a traditional group, thanks to the fact that their teams can meet according to different time zones that, for example, might not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989 p. 109) is also an exclusive element of virtual teams.
The “invisible team” is the group in charge of management and to which each member reports. It is the one that sets the standards for each member.
What might motivate an organization to undergo the demanding process of establishing a learning organization? One purpose of applying the theoretical concepts of organizational learning is to drive innovation.
When all available resources are properly utilized in the operational departments of an organization, space is created for creativity and ingenuity.
As a result, the process of a team working together to overcome a difficulty may lead to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must first generate a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains continuous improvement as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data offer factual evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research. They thus narrow the field of research and give it greater accuracy.
The existing correlation between brain pathology and behavior contributes to the research of scientists.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to the boom of new technologies, we have the possibility of seeing and investigating structures and processes that occur in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with abundant information and material to develop simulation models, which enhance our understanding of mental processes.
Although artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it is a highly relevant specialty within computer science, which is responsible for the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Research in the field of AI involves the development of machines in order to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include, among others, monitoring, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and queries, as well as facial, handwriting and voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real-life problems.
The Artificial Intelligence system is now often used in the sectors of the economy, medicine, engineering and the military, just as it was incorporated into various software applications of video games and personal computers.
Field trips are an important part of any classroom, and it's common for a teacher to want to take their students to places that aren't accessible by bus.
The solution comes in the form of technology, through virtual excursions. Students can observe the objects on display in a museum, visit an aquarium or contemplate beautiful works of art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on an outing and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, the students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a web page about their trip to the state capital and each year the page is updated, but the previous versions are kept online in the form of a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Even though students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, this usually changes in the presence of an audience.
Because students are often the most critical readers, the blogger begins to strive to improve his writing in order to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogging “demands that students be more understanding of the world around them.” The need to engage their audience inspires them to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspire collaboration and encourage students to deepen their learning beyond the typical school day.
The proper use of blogs “can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through active response to internet content, they can define their stances in the context of others’ writings, as well as establish their perspectives on specific topics” (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the captivating bilingual capital of Canada and boasts a variety of museums and art galleries that showcase the country's history and current affairs.
Niagara Falls is further south and the north is home to the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these aspects, among others, are what make Ontario stand out as intrinsically Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
The large areas further north are sparsely populated and some are wilderness lands, almost uninhabited.
To make a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadians.
The location of the islands of East Africa is off the east coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury resorts.
Islam was also brought to the lands by the Arabs and it became prevalent in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The initial tip of the European influence and colonialism took place in the 15th century, following the discovery, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, of the route that connects the Cape of Europe with India.
The region borders the Sahel to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is advised that all female visitors say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It will also be useful to wear a ring (just make sure it doesn't look too expensive).
Women need to realize that cultural differences can cause what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon to be followed, taken by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and do not be afraid to defend your position (whether there are cultural differences or not, that is not right!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were the Berber fishermen during the 10th century BC and the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese with the name of Casa Branca, but in 1755 it was abandoned after the occurrence of an earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by order of the Moroccan sultan with the name of Daru l-Badya and the Spanish merchants who set up their businesses there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places in all of Morocco to go shopping.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, there are many places where traditional Moroccan items are sold, such as clay pots, ceramics, leather products, water pipes and a whole range of trinkets, although everything is geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist spot in the Democratic Republic of Congo, on the eastern border, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left much of its streets submerged, especially in the center of the city.
While Goma is quite safe, any visit outside should be considered in order to be aware of the situation of the ongoing clashes in the North Kivu province.
In turn, the city is the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and its mountain gorilla sightseeing excursions are among the most economical in Africa.
To get around in Goma, you can choose to take a boda-boda (mototaxi). The regular (local) fare is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
This, combined with the fact that it is relatively inaccessible, has given “Timbuktu” an image of an exotic and distant land.
Although today Timbuktu is an impoverished city, it still has an airport and its reputation makes it a tourist attraction.
In 1990, it was added to the list of places of the heritage of humanity at risk, as a result of the threat of the desert sands.
It was one of the most important stops on Henry Louis Gates' special, Wonders of the African World, on PBS.
The city is very different from the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab than African style.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and the Crocodile River in the south.
The park has an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which has a different wildlife.
This is one of South Africa's most important attractions and is recognized as the main icon of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
As in all natural reserves in South Africa, there are daily fees for conservation and access to the park.
It may also be convenient to purchase a Wild Card that allows entry to park selections in South Africa or to all National Parks in the country.
The territory of Hong Kong takes its name from the homonymous island, which is the main attraction for most tourists.
The deployment of buildings that delimit the horizon of Hong Kong has been compared to a luminous bar graph that is evidenced by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront, located opposite.
It is in the lands recovered from the north coast of Hong Kong where its urban development is concentrated, densely.
This is the site that the British conquerors adopted as their own, so if you want to see evidence of this region's colonial past, it's a convenient place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast of Bangladesh and India inland.
UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The section of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
That being said, the forests are not just mangroves, but also contain some of the last remaining trees from the once-impressive jungles that covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans comprises an area of 3850 km2 and about a third of its extension is covered by water or marshy areas.
The Sundarbans have been, since 1966, a temple of wildlife and it is estimated that currently there are 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the district station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those traveling east and to Jakar (also called Bumthang), leave between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
Because buses between districts are often full of passengers, it is recommended to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Almost all districts have the service of Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi ride is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places like Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River bridge is a cantilever structure that crosses it, connecting Oiapoque, a Brazilian city, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes 3.5 m wide.
Under the bridge there is a 15-meter free space and, although its construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
Full operation of the bridge is estimated for September 2017, which is when it is expected that the Brazilian customs controls will be completed.
The area that currently constitutes eastern Paraguay was inhabited by the Guarani, who were the most important indigenous group in the region and who lived as semi-nomadic hunters, in addition to practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who hunted, gathered and fished for a living.
Paraguay, formerly known as “The Giant Province of the Indies”, was born in the 16th century, as a product of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began the colonization stage, which lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its aboriginal idiosyncrasy and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Other tournaments and lower-level matches can also be seen in other parts of the year.
On the website of the Argentine Polo Association you can find information about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The value of the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the official currency of the Falkland Islands, is set at parity with the British pound (GBP).
There is only one bank on the islands. You can change your money there. It is opposite the FIC West store in Stanley.
Pounds sterling are usually accepted anywhere within the islands. In Stanley, you can also pay with credit cards or US dollars.
There is a chance that credit cards may not be accepted on the outer islands, but you could use British or American money. Ask the owners in advance to find out what payment methods are accepted.
It is virtually impossible to change money from the Falkland Islands outside the archipelago, so make sure you do so before you leave.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with frequent temperatures above +30° C during the summer.
Winter cold can be deceiving: while it is very rare for temperatures to be below freezing, wind and humidity interact to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specifically “rainy” or “dry” seasons; the amount of rain remains almost the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to seeing people, wildlife is still wild, so it should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you should keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from the rest of the wild animals.
Despite how docile they may look, the fact is that bison, moose, elk, bears, and practically all large animals can be aggressive.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year for not keeping a safe distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so please respect their space.
Also, remember that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so you should avoid having or cooking foods that give off a lot of aroma and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa, the city of Apia is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a disastrous naval confrontation when seven German, American and English ships refused to leave the port.
They sank all the boats, except for a British cruiser. Nearly two hundred Americans and Germans died.
During the independence war waged by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the murder of the head of state Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are a large number of beaches, due to the fact that Auckland has two ports. The most well-known are located in three areas.
In the North Harbour district, on the Pacific Ocean, are the North Shore beaches, which stretch from Long Bay, in the north, to Devonport, in the south.
The beaches are almost all sandy with safe swimming areas and most have pohutukawa trees providing shady spots.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive, the extravagant neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers, and the central region of Auckland are all located in the Waitemataas harbor.
These are family-friendly beaches, sometimes very busy, with numerous and varied shops available on the premises. They are also safe for swimming.
Number One is the most popular local beer and it is not complex, but rather pleasant and refreshing. The other regional beer is Manta.
While there is a wide variety of French wines, those from New Zealand and Australia could be considered better for transportation.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you are concerned, you can easily find bottled water.
Australians consider the notion of "flat white" coffee to be foreign. A small black coffee is called "espresso", cappuccino is served with cream (instead of foam) and tea is not taken with milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Numerous trips to the reef are made throughout the year and, there, injuries from any of these causes are rare.
In any case, accept the advice of the authorities, respect all signs and pay special attention to security alerts.
Cubomedusas are located near beaches and river estuaries from October to April, north of 1770. Sometimes they can be found outside of this period.
Sharks do exist, but they almost never attack people. Most of them are afraid of them and would swim away.
The ocean is not where saltwater crocodiles actively reside. Their primary habitat is the river estuaries located north of Rockhampton.
Booking accommodation in advance of your trip gives you the peace of mind that you will have a place to sleep when you arrive at your destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with specific hotels, although through them it is also possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping areas.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transfers to and from the airport, and even combined packages of flights and accommodation.
They can also hold the reservation for you in case you need time to think better about the offer, or to obtain other documents for your destination (such as, for example, the visa).
However, any amendments or requests must be made through the travel agent in the first instance, and not directly through the hotel.
At some festivals, most of those attending the music events decide to camp on site and most of the spectators consider it a crucial aspect of the experience.
If you want to see the action up close, then you'll need to arrive early at the campground to secure a spot near the musical events.
It should be noted that while the musical performances may have ended, other areas of the festival could continue until the early hours of the morning.

In addition, visibility can be reduced by snowfall or by the condensation or ice that forms on the car windows.
On the other hand, in many countries, ice and snow conditions are normal and traffic flows almost without any interruption throughout the year.
Safaris are probably Africa's biggest tourist draw and the most memorable part of the trip for many visitors.

It can happen that travellers come across animal plagues that are not known in the regions they come from.
Pests are capable of ruining food, causing irritation or, in more serious cases, causing allergic reactions, spreading poison or transmitting infections.

On the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, the stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most challenging to drive on, often traversing remote and lonely terrain.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, be alert: there are many steep slopes, narrow lanes and tight bends.
The speed limits are noticeably lower than on the previous and following sections, generally 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h), and their strict enforcement is even more important than in any other section.
However, interestingly, cell phone signal is much better here than in many other sections of the highway like Pennsylvania Wilds.

The stirrups are the supports for the riders' feet that hang on both sides of the saddle.
While they provide greater stability for the rider, they can present safety issues, as it is possible for their feet to get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the animal runs away. To reduce the risk, there are a number of safety precautions.
Firstly, most riders use riding boots with a heel that has a ready and rather narrow sole.
In addition, there are saddles, especially English ones, with safety bars that allow the leather of the stirrup to come away from its structure if a rider who is thrown pulls back.
The Cochamó Valley is Chile's most popular climbing destination and is known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of extensive granite walls and crags.

The idea of skiing is very old, as there are rock paintings that depict skiers and date back to around 5,000 BC.
As a discipline, alpine skiing dates back no later than the 17th century. In 1861, Norwegians opened the first skiing recreational club in Australia.
Backpacker skiing: also known as rural, cross-country or ski touring.
While they are related, in general it does not involve practicing cross-country skiing or alpine mountaineering, developed on steep slopes and with much more rigid skis and footwear.

Under satisfactory conditions, it will manage to cover distances a little longer than if it were walking, but very rarely will it reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a good weight backpack on groomed tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to manage visa applications and passport controls several times.
However, the Schengen area functions as a single country in this regard.
Generally, as long as you move within this region you will be able to cross borders without going through passport control again.
In the same way, having a Schengen visa means that you do not need to apply for permits for each of the member countries of this area separately, which will save you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal criterion to determine when a manufactured item can be considered an antique. Some tax agencies have established that items over 100 years old are antiques.

It can happen that handmade products are classified as antiques, even though they are newer than mass-produced goods with similar characteristics.
Reindeer husbandry is a fundamental way of life among the Sami people, and the culture related to this commercial activity is important for many who work in other professions.
Still, even traditionally, not all Lapps have been engaged in reindeer breeding on a large scale, but have lived off fishing, hunting and other similar activities, using reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Today, many Lapps work in modern commercial activities. Tourism represents an important income in Lapland, the Sámi region.

Transgender people who have not yet had surgery should not have to go through scanners with their dignity and privacy intact.
Return currents are the flow that comes back from the waves breaking on the shore, often in a reef or similar.
Due to the submarine topography, the return flow converges in certain areas of greater depth and there a fast current can originate heading towards deep waters.

Finland is an excellent destination for boating: the "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
A yacht is not always necessary in archipelagos and lakes.
While the coastal archipelagos and the most abundant lakes are wide enough for any yacht, smaller vessels or even a kayak provide a different experience.
Boating is a national recreational activity in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
The same is true in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but apart from that, it is quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one in forty).
Most exclusive cruises that take place through the Baltic Sea include a long stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.

Courier companies are paid very well to make fast deliveries. Often, time is of the essence when it comes to business documents, merchandise, or parts for urgent repairs.
Large companies have their own planes on some routes, but there was a problem for smaller companies and other routes.
If they made a shipment by air freight, in some routes they may have been delayed for days in unloading and customs.
The only option to make it faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations prohibit carrying luggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to travel first class or business class on a plane is to spend a fortune on that privilege (or, better, to get your company to pay for you).
But this comes at a price: in general, you can end up paying up to four times more for the economy fare in business class and up to eleven times in economy class.
Usually, it's a waste of time to look for discounts for first class or business class seats on direct flights.
Airlines are well aware that there is a core group of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. Its regional language is Romanian, although Russian is also widely spoken.
