USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes the absolute necessity for the Olympic community to work together to create a safe environment for all its athletes.
We agree with the USOC that the best interests of our athletes and our clubs, and their sport, can be better served by driving meaningful change within our organization, rather than decertification.
USA Gymnastics has launched an independent investigation to understand how it was possible that an abuse of the size described with such courage by those who managed to survive Larry Nassar could have been hidden for so long, and is willing to implement any necessary or appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the same goal: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible, so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a reliable, positive and responsible environment.
Throughout the 1960s, Brzezinski was an advisor to John F. Kennedy and later to the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.

This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely accepted, but provides more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was brownish-gray on top, with a pale or carotenoid coloration on the bottom.
The discovery also allows for detailed information to be obtained about the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the dinosaur's feathers lack the basic structure, the so-called rachis, but instead have other features typical of feathers, barbs and barbules, the researchers concluded that the rachis is probably the result of an evolutionary development subsequent to these features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for courtship. The researchers hypothesize that, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the find shows adult feathers and not those of a chick.
According to the researchers' hypotheses, despite the tail belonging to a young dinosaur, the specimen reveals a plumage from an adult specimen and not that of a chick.

They found that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all stars in the solar system is determined by nothing other than their luminosity and rotation.
Brightness is used in conjunction with rotation to define a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to magnetic reversals.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the actual surveys of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect sought by the team was to be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a gravitational pull on Earth that generates tides, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same effects that "normal" matter has.
This theory suggests that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is collected in a kind of halo, formed from a multitude of small particles.
Television reports show white smoke coming out of the plant.

Dr Tony Moll has identified extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal.
According to a statement made in an interview, this new variant was "highly concerning and alarming, due to the high mortality rate."
According to Dr Moll, some patients may have contracted the bug within the hospital, and at least two of them were healthcare workers at the hospital itself.
Over the course of a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
Nevertheless, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people affected by tuberculosis still seems low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any given time in South Africa.

Following the construction of the dam in 1963, seasonal floods that spread sediment along the river course have stopped.
This sediment was instrumental in creating both beaches and sandbanks that became habitats for wildlife.
As a result, two species of fish have become extinct and two more are at risk of extinction, including the humpback mahi-mahi.
Even if the flood will only raise the water level by a few meters, the authorities hope that it will be enough to restore the eroded sandbanks further downstream.

The entrances to the caves, called "The Seven Sisters," all have a diameter of at least 100-250 meters (328-820 feet).
Infrared images show thermal oscillations between day and night, demonstrating that they are probably caves.
During the day they are colder than the surrounding surface, and at night they are warmer.
Glen Cushing of the astrogeology team at the US Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona, said: "Their thermal behaviour is not as consistent as that of large terrestrial caves, which often maintain a relatively stable temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground."
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters enter an isolated booth and put a pre-printed ballot into an envelope indicating their chosen candidate.
After the officials verify their identity, the voter deposits the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral register.
The French electoral law codifies the procedures in a rather rigorous way.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers can testify that no envelopes are present at the start of the vote and that no others are added to those of the duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send their representatives to attend every stage of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, in accordance with specific procedures.

Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider will have to undergo surgery to reconstruct his face.
Uka's weapon did not explode when it was pointed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider has constant pain, is blind in one eye, has a missing section of skull and his face has been reconstructed in titanium.
Schneider testified via video conference from a USAF base in his country.
In addition to Wednesday's event, Carpanedo participated in two individual races of the Championships.
The first in slalom, where she recorded a DNF in the first run. Another 36 competitors out of 116 in the same race did not complete the race.
The other race she participated in, the giant slalom, saw her finish tenth in the women's sitting category with a combined time of 4:41.30, more than 2:11.60 minutes slower than the winner, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and more than 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-placed Hungarian GyÃ¶ngyi Dani.
Four female skiers in the women's group failed to finish their runs, and 45 of the 117 participants in the Giant Slalom did not qualify for the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police managed to recover the laptop and mobile phone that had been stolen.
Deputy Inspector General DK Arya announced: "Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman. We have also found her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
None of the three people who were in the house at the time of the car crash were injured.
Despite this, the driver was seriously injured to the head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been at Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with killing her own son.
She is being held pending trial and sentencing, but any testimony given by an eyewitness could be tainted, as her image has been widely publicized.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice has different parameters. Scottish courts have deemed the publication of the photos potentially prejudicial.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee, "journalists who publish photos or other information about suspicious individuals are walking on a minefield."
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecutions, told journalists that no further comment would be made until the formal charge was made.
According to leaks, the subject of the document will be the dispute over borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders that existed before the Middle East War of 1967.
According to what is said, the other topics addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement was signed, Israel demanded a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agreed to abandon such a presence only for five years.
Shooters on the experimental pest control program had to be closely supervised by rangers, as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association, the NPWS, in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., has recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting Park Conservation and Heritage Manager of the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive training and safety instructions.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth provisional electoral council in four years.
Last month a presidential commission proposed a package of measures aimed at pushing the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP.
The commission constituted Martelly's response to widespread protests, which began in October, that challenge the regime.
The occasionally violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which had been scheduled since 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of malfunctioning iPods have been reported, which caused a total of six fires and caused minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of another 34 incidents related to overheating, which the company described as "not serious."
In its response, the ministry called Apple's delay of the report "absolutely deplorable."
The earthquake in the Mariana Islands was felt at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office, no damage has been reported in the nation.
And the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that there were no signs of a tsunami in progress.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino police officer took hostage Hong Kong tourists after hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle, Rolando Mendoza fired on the tourists.
Many of the hostages were saved, at least six have died.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released immediately along with the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was struck down and killed.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
After completing her training in obstetrics, she began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, in his free time Liggins began to study cases of premature labor.
His research showed that the administration of a hormone would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two "black boxes" with flight recordings.
Even his fellow wrestlers wanted to pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, just like her. A strong woman."
"Luna was as weird as me... Maybe even more so... I loved her and I'm going to miss her... Let's hope she's in a better place," was Dustin "Goldust" Runnels' comment.
According to a survey of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
This view is shared by 34% of survey participants, who believe that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
At the other end of the survey, 29% of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that it should never become one.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but has suffered a number of ailments that have raised doubts over her fitness.
She was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome the pain because they are banned from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at Central Missouri University, discovered the largest prime number known to date.
The discovery was verified by multiple people using various hardware and software in early February, and was announced Tuesday.
Comets could have been one of the sources that brought water and organic matter, i.e. matter capable of forming proteins and supporting life, to Earth.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and in particular how the Earth formed, having collided with comets a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, has been in office since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he signed a law that makes same-sex marriage legal.
According to him, speculation is nothing more than "political chatter and nonsense."
A presidential candidacy in 2016 is being considered.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow planes to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year, thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system employs satellite technology rather than the outdated ground-based radar-based system, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being arranged and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, while there are no car parks or park and ride facilities in the area.
Fears over the lack of transport have raised the possibility of the game being played behind closed doors, without the support of the team's fans.
According to a study published on Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of bird has been born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers from Princeton University, USA, and Uppsala University, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that the time required for this process was much longer; this was due to mating between a Darwin's endemic finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into any shape. It can be rolled to create tiny shapes.
It can be pulled until it forms a thin wire, suitable for being twisted and interwoven. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. Sometimes it was used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts" precisely because of its ability to be made so thin.
This is the so-called pH of the substance. Using red cabbage juice, it is possible to build a pH indicator.
The juice of the cabbage changes color based on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
The pH level of the chemical being analyzed is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the H in pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been stripped (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dried powders together and then, with clean and wet hands, stuff them into a ball.
Between the moisture on your hands and the outer layers, a reaction will occur that will cause a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
Almost all the houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with running water connected to an advanced sewage system.
In Greece, the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini have revealed the remains of sewage systems.
Toilets in ancient times also existed in Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, they were sometimes included in public baths, frequented by a mixed public of men and women.
To call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space using a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts the light and the view.
A rocket more than 100 feet tall is needed to transport a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world enormously. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important one is that it has provided us with simpler and faster transportation.
Thanks to his invention, the train, automobile, and several other means of transportation came into being.
Below them are other medium-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including domestic cats that roam free) that feed on vastly more numerous prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The concept of a niche is the secret of their success, a particular goal that each feline has and that allows them not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats and live in large groups called prides.
The packs are made up of adult males, usually 2 or 3 who are related to each other, and a number of females and cubs that can reach up to 30.
Usually females are closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The lion pride behaves in a way very similar to a wolf or dog pack, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not that of other big cats), even as far as deadly attacks on their prey are concerned.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (albeit not very well), swim, make very long jumps and exert a pulling force five times greater than that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the genus Panthera) as the lion, the leopard and the jaguar. These four felines are the only ones that roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as that of the lion, but it more closely resembles a sentence of shouted and angry words.
Ocelots love to feed on small animals. If possible, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the prey they catch is much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by smell, sniffing the ground where they have been.
Thanks to their night vision, they are able to see very well in the dark, as well as being able to move stealthily. To hunt their prey, ocelots blend in with their surroundings before pouncing on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population to which it belongs (for example, if it moves beyond a mountain range or a river, or moves to a new island, thus making a possible return difficult), it will likely find itself in an environment different from the one it was in before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, so, in order to position itself as a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations compared to those needed before.
The indigenous population has not changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
As time goes on and the new population adapts to its new environment, it looks less and less like the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which involves the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide exhaled by humans (through exhalation).
Plants process their own nutrition with the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes from plants and we produce our clothes from plants. Much of the food we eat is made from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its era and for this reason it feared nothing, except for other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were lined with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an additional row on the palate, so that anyone who crossed its path was doomed.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that it had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it's also possible that it was a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that went into the water; not even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex could compete with him.
Although much of their food would be familiar to us, Roman banquets also featured several strange or unusual dishes, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a gopher.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate while sitting on chairs, wealthy men liked to feast together while lying on their sides while consuming their meal.
Of course, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each deity, which was considered the dwelling place of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to provide for the needs of the deities through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built, which became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
Thanks to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, the house was not of fundamental importance.
Much of the Jewish family's life took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard, while the shops were simple open-air stalls that faced the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas it is said that it was Erik the Red who gave it its name, having encountered Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But, regardless of his discovery, at that time the Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although all were "Scandinavian" countries, the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland were very different.
If you saw the movie "The Da Vinci Code," you might think that a treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is false. Even if something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription "Original Declaration of Independence July 4, 1776." The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence the large parchment document (measuring 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Therefore, the annotation was probably just a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing clashes had brought northern France to liberation, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the Vichy regime, that is, by those French who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and had allied themselves with the invaders, instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France: this offensive operation was called "Operation Dragoon."
American and Free French forces had liberated southern France in just two weeks and were heading towards Germany.
Civilization refers to a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, forming a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis", which means civil; the term is in turn connected with "civis", meaning citizen, and "civitas", meaning city or city-state, and in a certain way it therefore also defines the dimensions of society.
City-states are the first entities to anticipate the idea of a nation. The culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge through multiple generations, leaving an indelible cultural imprint through fair distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving any significant historical traces, and are thus not recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states formed a weak central government for the first time, and the Congress was its only member, according to the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and with no executive or judicial power at the national level, it relied on often uncooperative state authorities to enforce its acts.
He didn't even have the authority to bypass tax laws and tariffs between states.
To change the articles required the unanimous consent of all states. These, for their part, had so little regard for the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German team, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are: football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are more widespread in the northern regions and see Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
The Japanese archipelago includes almost 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), which makes Japan the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
From a geographical point of view, Japan is referred to as an "archipelago", given the presence of groups of islands that make it up.
Taiwan was born in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by soon recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
The Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan in 1624, initiating a transformation that involved the indigenous people's cereal production systems and the employment of Chinese laborers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan came under the control of the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the first Sino-Japanese war (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, thereby ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan; the island remained under Japanese rule until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Much of the peripheral buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30% of the Machu Picchu site had been recovered, but restoration work is still ongoing.
The most common format in the world for still photography, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the most commonly used film at the end of the era of analog photography.
It is still produced today, and, more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Oddly enough, the height of the 35 mm format is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest ratio of whole numbers) are therefore considered to be 3:2.
The proportions of many common formats (for example, the APS format family) are equal to or very close to this value.
The much-abused and often derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while still maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point to place the main subject corresponds to the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
At this stage in European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, found itself under scrutiny.
The Christian religion had acted as a glue between European states for over a thousand years, despite linguistic and cultural differences.
Its ubiquitous power has influenced everyone, from the king to ordinary citizens.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary reserves exist precisely for this reason.
The central authority of the church has remained in Rome for over a thousand years, and this convergence of power and money has led many to question whether this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective: it involved the interruption of any essential military and civilian supply, despite this blockade violating international law, which is usually accepted and codified by multiple international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any vessel from accessing whole sections of the ocean, putting even neutral ships at risk.
As this tactic had elicited a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its indiscriminate U-boat warfare campaign.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer from the Edison Company in New York City, which led him to move to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his boss in his previous job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different periods of time were indicated in a very unique way: each period of China or each family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
The intervals between the individual dynasties were also characterized by periods of instability and division between the provinces. The most well-known was the so-called period of the Three Kingdoms, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
During these periods, fierce wars broke out between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in battles to secure a place of honor in the imposing palace in Xi'an.
The social and political effects are numerous, among these we can mention the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to the republic, nationalism and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and is not the property of a single sovereign.
Moreover, after the Revolution, professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same goes for the military, as army rankings, instead of being based on class, are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers of various countries to start their own revolution.
But Mohammed was deeply interested in matters beyond this life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, offers in itself a very clear image of the spirituality of Mohammed.
The cave sits atop one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely cut off from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find, even if you know it exists. Once inside the cave, isolation is total.
You can see nothing but a beautiful clear sky and a large number of mountains around. From inside the cave, you can see or hear very little of the surrounding world.
Among the Seven Wonders of the World, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one that has survived to the present day without being in ruins.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramid structures built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, is home to numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), various smaller tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The important pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the pharaoh's wives and family members.
The "arc up" sign looks like a V and the "arc down" sign looks like a staple or a square with the bottom side missing.
Up means you should start from the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start from the alamaro (which is where the hand supports the bow) and pull the bow towards yourself.
An upward bow usually generates a softer sound, while a downward bow results in a stronger and more decisive sound.
You can decide to add your own custom markings to the pencil, but keep in mind that the arching marks you find printed on have a musical significance, so they should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of market women forced King Louis XVI, in a state of terror, to leave Versailles and return to Paris, along with Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie ThÃ©rÃ¨se and 4-year-old Louis Charles) and King Louis XVI's sister, Elizabeth.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and screamed threats against the sovereigns.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep their carriage windows wide open.
At one point someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The war expenses of US imperialism incurred to conquer the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover a good part of the expenses and the interest on the bonds fluctuated in the name of the Philippine government through the banking institutions of Wall Street.
Clearly, the huge profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people formed the profits at the base of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history covering the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (from 1000 to 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or the technological imperative to the narrow sense according to which the fate of man is moved by an underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Much of the interpretation of technological determinism has in common two general ideas: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology has in turn "effects" on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the automobile necessarily involves the development of the road network.
However, a national road network for just a few cars is not economically sustainable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs associated with owning a car.
Mass ownership of automobiles also leads to a higher percentage of accidents on the roads, and as a result, the invention of new rescue techniques for the care of injured people.
Romanticism was characterized by a strong component of cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography conditioned individuals, and over time, customs, mores, and culture related to that geography arose, which, being in harmony with the context of society, proved more effective than laws imposed arbitrarily.
Similarly to Paris, now known as the capital of contemporary fashion, Constantinople was the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a hub of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until around 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century its prestige declined, mainly due to the fact that the crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of the Gothic style was reached in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the east.
But the slowness of communication channels means that the spread of styles in the West can be delayed by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the time, resulting from the Crusades, was the introduction of buttons for fastening clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is defined as agriculture practiced solely for the purpose of producing enough to meet the food needs of the farmer/farmer's family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, usually organic, that uses seeds saved from the original ecological region in association with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at getting the most out of the harvest.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and in many developing countries, this is still the case.
Subcultures unite individuals with the same opinions who do not feel represented by society's standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished by the age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, manners, and slang.
One of the most commonly used methods for explaining the importance of socialization is to analyze some unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, following misfortunes, or as a result of intentional abuse, grew up without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "feral" or wild. Some of them have been segregated by people (often their own parents): in some cases, abandonment is motivated by the parents' refusal to accept a serious intellectual or physical disability.
Feral children may have suffered serious violence or trauma before abandonment or flight.
Other children may have been raised by animals; still others seem to have lived alone in the wild.
When the feral child is fully raised by non-human animals, it shows behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely analogous to those of the particular animal that took care of it, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Project-based learning should make learning itself easier and more interesting, while scaffolding goes a bit further.
Scaffolding is not a mode of learning, but rather a help for those who undertake a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "scaffolding," but so is the little paperclip-shaped assistant in Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are designed to interrogate, prompt and explain procedures that the student may have found difficult to manage on their own.
Children are given into foster care for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, if not even extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that does not guarantee them nourishment, care and education, but that is what happens to them.
We believe that foster care is a safe place for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education, and reliable health care.
It is assumed that foster care meets all the needs that are not met in the home from which the child was taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the theory of uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord's (1998) study of audience reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal involvement" and "continuous relationships."
The use of video recording has allowed for significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is argued that it is possible to discover if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks illustrated how people unable to understand spoken language due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even argues that such abilities in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research has shown the existence of two pools of genetic variability, namely hidden variability and expressed variability.
With mutation, a new genetic variability is added, and with selection, it is eliminated from the pool of expressed variability.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute variability back and forth between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to meet their amino acid requirements with the plant resources available in the savannah.
Moreover, the failure to carry out these activities has serious consequences: slowed growth, malnutrition, and, in the end, even death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us they are difficult to digest, unless they are cooked.
Animal foods, on the other hand (such as ants, termites, and eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
In light of all this, it should come as no surprise that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a sense much like savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the intentional process of waking during the normal sleep period, followed by a resumption of sleep (10â€“60 minutes later).
This process can be easily practiced using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you into a state of consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you decide to reset the clock while you sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you will be forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biological rhythm-focused options involve consuming a lot of fluids before bed (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which forces you to get up to urinate.
A person enjoys inner peace in proportion to the tension existing in his body and spirit.
The less tension, the more positive the vital force that exists. Each of us has the potential ability to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. This goal is only hindered by our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of love of the Mahayana ritual and by various techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It is based on Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and a path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini Yoga activates the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) through the use of yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the core of Tibetan meditation. By visualizing various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is developed.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, systemic, procedural, and cultural conflicts caused a break between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would have lasted for the next 40 years and would have been fought for real, by mercenary armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and in many other countries.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been breached; the only option was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans, however, proved to be outdated almost immediately, as more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers advanced and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga peace treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral treaties.
Taking advantage of ships for the transport of goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the navy has always been to guarantee the country the safeguarding of its ability to move people and goods, while at the same time countering the ability of enemies to move their people and goods.
One of the recent examples in support of this theory and most noteworthy is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. During the battle, the Americans were trying to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to support Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, attempted to disrupt this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have had the chance to conquer Great Britain, just as it had done in the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
They were bred by ancient cultures and tribes to have milk, wool, meat and skin readily available.
Domestic goats were usually raised in herds that were allowed to roam the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by caprai (similar to shepherds) who were often children or teenagers. These methods of pastoralism are still used today.
Wagonways were already being built in England in the 16th century.
Despite being simply formed of parallel wooden planks, the wagonway, when compared to the slightly more bumpy roads of the time, allowed horses travelling on them to reach greater speeds and move heavier loads.
The sleepers were introduced relatively early to keep the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
It became a common practice, although the iron caused greater wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Finally, wooden wheels gave way to iron ones. In 1767, the first completely iron rails appeared.
The first means of transportation that mankind has known are the legs. Humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means "upright man").
Its predecessor, the australopithecine, did not habitually walk upright.
Signs of bipedalism specialization are present in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate future suffering to some extent, we can start to adopt more environmentally friendly lifestyles, we can join the environmental movement and also do activism.
In many cases, this only works as a symptomatic treatment. If we do not want only a temporary solution, we should find the ultimate cause of the problems and deactivate it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of humanity, while the problems have increased due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
After Congress adopted it on July 4, a manuscript draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were produced that night, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides."
The document was first read publicly on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall, and the task was entrusted to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops stationed in New York on July 9, while a copy arrived in London on August 10.
Dunlap's 25 known broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript is lost.
According to many paleontologists today, one category of dinosaurs survived and is still alive. They are the ones we call birds.
Many tend not to consider them dinosaurs because of their feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds have many characteristics that unite them with dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they have scaly feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs.
Ultimately, the manipulation of information encoded as binary numbers is the basis of all computers currently in use.
A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and in technical computer language these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and its symptoms, including vomiting, are very general, making an immediate diagnosis impossible.
The main indication of internal poisoning could be the presence in the house of an open container of medication or of noxious chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions related to that specific poison.
The term mite is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the familiarity in ancient times with bed bugs, insects that have strongly adapted to become parasites of humans.
Both bed bugs and assassin bugs are nesting, meaning they are adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States of America, multiple sclerosis (MS) records around 400,000 known cases, ranking first among neurological diseases that affect young people and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The research highlighted that the chances of developing MS are double for females compared to males.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their interest, or in the interest of their child.
These couples have the option of choosing an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the natural parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides most scientific inquiry.
But it is not just about experimentation, since an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also allows you to guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on the various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the gradual decline of the Greek language, the West was isolated from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior are crucially dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been documented, which are not just reactions to external periodic signals, in relation to most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, the free cycle of which continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was the one conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, that is, viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments highlighting the bacteriophage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a range of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material involved, and whether the cells affected are part of the germ line.
The mutations that can be passed on to children are only those at the level of germ cells; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including the flora and wildlife.
Examples of activities to do on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, park visits, and studying information about the ecosystem.
For example, by visiting, photographing and getting to know the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small rural towns in their cars to go to work, crossing paths with others whose workplace is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic back-and-forth, everyone is somehow connected to a transportation system based on private cars, which they also support.
Today science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere outside of one of its conditions of stability that allowed human evolution over the past two million years.
Every person participates in social life and uses transportation systems, which almost everyone complains about.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about the quality of water or bridges falling into disrepair.
Why do transport systems attract so many complaints, why are they failing every day? Are the engineers who design them incompetent, or are there deeper motivations?
"Traffic Flow" is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is complex because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, driver behavior tends to fall within a reasonably constant range, so traffic flows themselves tend to show a reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically in a generic way.
In order to obtain a more accurate representation of the traffic flow, the three main variables were correlated: (1) flow rate, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for planning, designing and managing road structures.
Insects were the first animals to take to the skies. The ability to fly allowed them to escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Many insects are helped by the ability to fold their wings along their body.
This allows them to exploit a greater variety of small crevices to hide from predators.
Of all the insects that exist today, the only ones that are not able to fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the Sun.
Some were right, but many others believed the opposite, that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and also the other stars), moved around the Earth.
Which seems sensible, because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the largest and second-longest river on Earth. It carries a volume of water that is 8 times that of the second-largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with a width that reaches six miles in some places.
A total of 20% of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It is fed by the waters of thousands of smaller tributaries.
Stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in terms of their size and technical excellence.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom remained enchanted by the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is made up of around 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the one with the smallest population.
The official language of the Vatican City for legislation and official communications is Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most people working within the state, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
In the Vatican City, all citizens are Roman Catholics.
The man began to get to know the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper already in ancient times: these elements can be discovered in nature in native form and can be extracted quite easily with the help of primitive tools.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is made up of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
These in fact resemble more the four states of matter, namely (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma. However, he also theorized that they transformed into new substances, forming what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains numerous elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There can also be alloys composed of small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter, and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly small, so many trillions of them could fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
After its invention, the pencil has proved to be a good friend for many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and less widespread use.
Today everyone writes messages on computer screens and never needs to approach a thermometer.
We can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer arrives.
The principle that energy is required to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is the basis of the operation of the fission bomb.
In practice, it's like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. So, by further dividing the nucleus, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break apart in the presence of little or no push.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust, and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km on the farthest side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under mountainous areas.
The maria may be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner, which has facilitated the upwelling of lava to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they grow up.
These theories analyze what unites some people and pushes them to want to do what they do, and what are the factors of the context in which they live that push them to do or not do certain things.
Among the most popular content theories are Maslowâ€™s Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzbergâ€™s Two-Factor Theory.
In general, when managers start to manage their former colleagues, two behaviors can emerge. On the one hand, there are those who try to remain "one of the guys" (or the girls).
The manager of this type finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, to implement disciplinary actions, to evaluate performance, to define and assign responsibilities.
At the opposite extreme, the manager becomes a completely different person, who feels that they must change the entire operation of the team and make it their own.
In the end, the leader is the person who is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often generates disagreements between leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence for virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with a few small differences.
Members of the virtual team often serve as a point of contact for their next physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as meetings can take place according to various time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
The management team to which each member refers is called the "invisible team" and it is the one that sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization want to go through the long process of building a learning organization? A good reason for implementing the concepts of organizational learning may be innovation.
When you can effectively utilize all available resources across all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the path of collaboration within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
For an organization to be considered innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates the theory of the continuum as a method employed to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
The neurobiological results have demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. The research area becomes narrower and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is the basis of scientists' research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors can affect behavior and modify certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and brain processes that have never been observed before.
This gives us a wealth of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Despite having a strong science fiction connotation, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research includes building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of applications include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as recognition of handwriting, voice and facial features.
These things have become distinct disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, and are also integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are a key part of the curriculum, and teachers often want to take their students to places that are not accessible by bus.
The solution is offered by technology with virtual tours. Students can see the artifacts of museums, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great excuse to share travel experiences and reflections with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennet School, North Carolina, design a website about their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned every year, but previous versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Often, their first experiences with blogging are marked by poor grammar and spelling, but typically the presence of an audience changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative judgments the blog author is committed to improving their writing.
Blogs also "force students to become more aware of the moment around them." The need to feed the public's interest motivates students to be ingenious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop students' learning well beyond the normal school day.
"Proper use of blogs 'can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their own position within the writings of others, as well as delineate their own perspectives on specific issues' (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the charming and bilingual capital of Canada, rich in art galleries and museums that tell the story of the country's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and to the north you can admire the natural and unspoiled beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All of this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
The broad areas to the north are sparsely populated, some of which are almost uninhabited wildernesses.
If you compare the population, the result can be surprising for many: in the United States, the number of African American citizens is higher than that of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a continent in its own right.
Almost all of the smaller islands, known as luxurious seaside resorts, are mostly independent nations or associated with France.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the land, which embarked on a long journey towards the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape Route, which goes from Europe to India, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama paved the way for European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, while to the south and west it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean.
For female travelers: all are advised to declare themselves as married, regardless of their actual civil status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
It is appropriate for women to realize that cultural differences can lead to what they themselves consider harassment, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Have the strength to refuse men, and do not be afraid to stand up to them (cultural differences or not, there is no excuse!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; under the name of Anfa, it was a port of strategic importance used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merinides.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city, which was called Daru l-Badya, and was later named Casablanca by Spanish traders who chose this place for their trading bases.
Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and lots of trinkets, but all of this is reserved only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying much of the city's streets, especially those in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is advisable to do your research before making any visits outside of Goma, so as to assess the state of the ongoing clashes in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the less expensive opportunities to see the mountain gorillas of Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Also as a result of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" ended up becoming a metaphor for exotic and distant land.
Today, Timbuktu is a decaying city, but for its reputation it remains a tourist attraction, also equipped with an airport.
In 1990, it was included in the list of UNESCO World Heritage sites that are in danger, due to the threat posed by desert sands.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World."
With its more Arabic than African touch, the city stands out sharply from the others in the country.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and stretches east along the border with Mozambique, to the north it borders Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
With a surface area of 19,500 kmÂ², the park comprises 14 different ecozones, each of which provides sustenance for a different wildlife population.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the most important of the South African national parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and park entry fees.
Purchasing a Wild Card may also be useful, as it allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
The Island of Hong Kong, which gives its name to the entire territory, is the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been likened to a glittering bar graph, made all the more striking by being framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the waterfront of Kowloon across the way.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development has been concentrated on reclaimed land on the densely populated north shore.
This is the place that the English colonizers chose for themselves, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this land, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast inland in Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest included in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only made up of mangrove swamps: they also contain what remains of the impressive jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 kmÂ², of which about a third is made up of marshy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for wildlife; it is estimated that there are 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang) depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
As often the shuttle buses between different districts are full, it is a good idea to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most neighborhoods are served by comfortable and sturdy Japanese minibuses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby locations, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
Its two pylons are 83 metres high, it is 378 metres long and has two lanes that are 3.50 metres wide.
Below the bridge, the free vertical space is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
In September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge should be fully operational.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group living in present-day eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and the PayaguÃ¡, who lived off hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Province of the Indies," was born in the 16th century from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
Since the founding of AsunciÃ³n in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its identity and its native peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina boasts one of the best teams and players of polo in the world.
In December, the most important tournament of the year takes place in the polo fields of Las CaÃ±itas.
Here you can watch minor tournaments and matches at other times of the year as well.
For information on tournaments and purchasing tickets for polo matches, contact the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The Falklands have their own official currency, the Falkland pound (FKP), the value of which is equivalent to that of the British pound (GBP).
The only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store, offers currency exchange services.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, you can often pay with credit cards and US dollars.
It is likely that in the outlying islands they will not accept credit cards, although British and US currencies may be accepted. Check with the owners in advance to decide on an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so change your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months temperatures above 30Â°C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the feeling of a temperature lower than that indicated by the thermometer.
There are no defined "dry" and "rainy" seasons: the amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year.
Even though many of the park's animals are used to human visitors, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials recommend keeping at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife.
No matter how docile they may seem: bison, moose, deer, bears, practically all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured for not keeping a proper distance. These animals need to be given enough space as they are large, wild and potentially dangerous.
Also, be aware that odors can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking foods with very strong smells, and try to keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoa Islands. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This port was the site of the infamous 1889 naval standoff, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the Mau movement's struggle for independence, a peaceful rally in the town led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme chief.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is located between two harbors. The most popular ones are divided into three areas.
The Pacific Ocean beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are mainly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook Waitemata Harbour.
These are family-friendly beaches that can get a bit crowded at times, surrounded by a wide range of shops. You can swim safely.
The most well-known local beer is a non-complex, pleasant and refreshing beer called "Number One". The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can get many French wines, but Australian and New Zealand wines might fare better on the journey.
The tap water is totally safe to drink, but if you are worried, bottled water is easy to find.
According to the Australians, the 'flat white' coffee was born from a foreign idea. An 'espresso' is a short black coffee, a cappuccino is covered in cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is on par with the Belgian version. Fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Throughout the year, many excursions are made to the coral reef and accidents due to one of these causes on the coral reef are rare.
Always seek advice from the authorities, follow their instructions and pay particular attention to safety notices.
Cubomedusae appear from October to April near the beaches and river estuaries north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside of this period, they can only be found occasionally.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks fear humans and tend to keep their distance.
The habitat of the saltwater crocodiles is mainly the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton, as they do not actively live in the ocean.
By booking in advance, the traveler has the peace of mind of finding a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with certain hotels, but it is still possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages that include breakfast, transfers to and from the airport, or even flight+hotel packages.
They can also hold the booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain further documents required for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any changes or requests must be made first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, most attendees choose to camp on site, considering this aspect a crucial part of the experience.
To be close to the center of the action, you need to arrive early and secure a spot near the music.
Remember that once the music finishes on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival where the music goes on late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the North Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice causes rather annoying noises for those who are most exposed to it.
St. Petersburg cruises include time for exploring the city, and cruise passengers are granted visa-free entry (check conditions).
Generally, casinos do everything they can to increase the amount of time and money spent by their guests. Typically, there are no windows or clocks, and exits can be hard to find.
They usually offer exclusive food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests in high spirits and make them want to stay.
In some establishments, alcoholic beverages are offered by the house. However, the state of intoxication alters the ability to make judgments, and every good gambler knows how important it is to remain sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice or temperatures close to zero.
On icy and snow-covered carriageways, the friction is reduced and it is not possible to drive as when on clean asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in such a short time that you can get stuck.
Even precipitation and gusts of snow, or the formation of ice or condensation on the vehicle windows, can reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the centerpiece of many visitors' holidays.
In its popular use, the term safari refers to trips taken overland, particularly in the savannah, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to come closer to cars, so normal equipment is sufficient to get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, which is why it is possible to observe them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk", "hiking safari", or "foot safari") is an excursion that can last a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2012, and some of the events will take place in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, as the first Olympics were held there in 1964.
If your booking for flights and accommodation for 2020 was made before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but most coronavirus-related cancellation policies as of late March 2020 do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that the cost of most event tickets will be between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, while regular tickets will cost around 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry faster. Many hotels offer the use of an iron and ironing board, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try with a hair dryer, if you have one available.
Be careful not to expose the fabrics to too high temperatures, to avoid shrinkage or, in the worst case, burning.
There are various ways to sanitize water, and some of these are more effective against specific risks.
In some areas, it is enough to boil the water for a minute, in others it takes many minutes.
The effectiveness of filters is variable, so in case of doubt it is advisable to evaluate the purchase of water packaged in sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travellers may come into contact with animal parasites that are not found in their home regions.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, as well as transmit poison or infections.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with force are not usually classified as harmful animals.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy tax-free and excise-free products in certain locations.
Travellers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont is the one with the most difficult driving conditions, as it often crosses isolated areas among the vegetation.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, it is recommended that you keep your eyes wide open, as steep slopes, narrow roads and tight curves predominate.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than those applied in the previous and subsequent sections (normally 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h). Their strict observance is extremely important.
Strangely, however, in this area the level of mobile phone coverage is much higher than in other stretches of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite tasty and varied, similar to those of nearby Austria further south.
Fruit desserts are a timeless classic, from those with apples available all year round to those with cherries and plums, which make their appearance during the summer.
Several German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. The most popular cakes often go very well with a cup of strong coffee.
Those who want to taste small but flavorful pastries can opt for those that, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid it contains.
In northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is usually used for curries in the inland regions; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more commonly used.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found in the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term generally refers to foods originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island, Java.
The Javanese cuisine, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a series of dishes of simple preparation; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially the Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet and are hung on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can present safety problems due to the possibility that the rider's feet may become trapped.
If a jockey is thrown off a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged along by the escaping horse. To minimise this risk, there are some safety measures that can be taken.
First of all, most knights wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather thin sole.
Later, some saddles, especially English ones, included safety bars, which cause a leather strap to detach from the saddle when, in the event of a fall, the rider pulls it back.
CochamÃ³ Valley: the most important climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, where there are a large number of enormous granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks include breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world are continually tracing new routes on its potentially infinite walls.
Downhill snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular and involve sliding down the snow using skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts many enthusiasts, sometimes even referred to as "ski bums" who dedicate entire holiday periods to skiing in a particular area.
The principle behind skiing is very old: the first cave paintings depicting humans skiing date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport has its origins at least in the 17th century; in 1861, the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia by the Norwegians.
Ski hiking: the activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski mountaineering or ski trekking.
It is connected, even if it usually does not understand it, to touring skiing or skimo, which are practiced on steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski run as a hiking trail.
If conditions are good, you can cover distances somewhat greater than when walking, but only very rarely will you reach cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but made up of many independent countries. Normally, to travel through multiple countries, you would need to apply for a visa and go through passport control multiple times.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area functions more like a single country.
If you stay within this area, you can usually go from one border to the other without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual member countries, thus saving time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what makes an item an antique. Some tax agencies consider an item to be an antique if it is at least 100 years old.
The definition has geographical differences from the age limit, which can be lower, as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
Craft objects could be defined as antiques, even if they are more recent than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the SÃ¡mi, and the culture on which this trade is based is also the foundation of many other professions.
Even over time, not all SÃ¡mi have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding; some lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer primarily as work animals.
Today, many SÃ¡mi people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in SÃ¡pmi, the SÃ¡mi homeland.
Even though it is widely used, particularly among non-Roma people, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a misperception of Roma people.
If a travel warning is issued for the destination you will be visiting, there may be consequences for your travel health insurance or your cancellation insurance.
You may also be interested in the opinions of governments other than your own, but keep in mind that these opinions are aimed at the citizens of those governments.
To take one example, American citizens in the Middle East might encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The alerts are simply a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions reported are often superficial, general and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Adverse weather conditions" is the general expression used to indicate any dangerous meteorological phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of them, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, above-average precipitation and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similarly to thunderstorms, tornadoes, sea tornadoes and cyclones.
Among the regional and seasonal weather phenomena of high intensity are thunderstorms, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travellers are advised to check the adverse weather conditions in their area, as they may affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could potentially be considered a war zone must undergo professional training.
By searching the Internet for 'Hostile Environment Course', you are likely to find the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A standard course lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing games, as well as many training activities on first aid and sometimes on weapons.
Books and magazines about survival in the wild are abundant, while there are few publications that deal with war zones.
Travellers who plan to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have valid travel documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without sex designations (X) or updated documents to match a desired name and gender is variable.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept such documents is also variable.
Even security checks have become much more thorough in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
People who are pre-operative transgender should not expect to pass through security without their privacy and dignity being violated.
Rip currents are formed by the return flow of waves breaking on the beach, often near a coral reef or similar formation.
Given the submarine topography, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current can form towards the open sea.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion in attempting to swim against the current, which can prove impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back will no longer be more difficult than usual.
Try to find an area where you are not at risk of being trapped again, or consider whether to wait for rescue, based on your skills and whether you have been spotted.
Re-entry shock manifests itself in a shorter time than cultural shock (as there is a shorter "honeymoon" phase), lasts longer, and can be more serious.
Travelers who have found it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes have difficulty readjusting to the culture of their home country.
When returning home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the customs of your original culture.
In your first experience abroad, you are likely to have encountered patient and understanding people, aware that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
Many people did not imagine that patience and awareness were also necessary for those returning home.
The spectacle of sounds and lights of the pyramid is the most interesting thing in the area for children.
Before the start of the show, it will be possible to admire the pyramids immersed in darkness and silence.
Normally, you can always hear the noise caused by tourists and vendors. The spectacle of sounds and lights is just like a collection of stories.
The Sphinx becomes the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by various countries, the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the largest number of bases, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among the other islands are Livingston Island and Deception Island; in the latter, the caldera of an active volcano filled with water has given rise to a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region located to the south of the peninsula and overlooks the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then re-emerge to form the Ellsworth Mountains, a 360 km long chain cut in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Range, boasts the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4,892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, where there is no cellular coverage, a satellite phone may be the only possible alternative.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a cell phone, because you need to be outside with an unobstructed view of the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by recreational boats, including pleasure craft, as well as by missions that require remote data and voice communication.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
One of the increasingly popular options for those planning to take a gap year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly popular among recent graduates, as they can take a year off before starting university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad during the sabbatical year can actually increase the chances of returning to higher education in their home country.
Usually, enrollment in these educational programs requires payment of a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love boating. In the "Land of a Thousand Lakes", there are also thousands of islands, both within the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You donâ€™t necessarily need a yacht for the archipelagos and lakes.
Even if the coastal archipelagos and the larger lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national pastime, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This also happens in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but it is generally a rather singular fact (for example, in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Many of the different Baltic cruises include a multi-day stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that it is possible to visit the historic town for two full days, returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.
For landing on the ground, a separate visa will not be required (as of 2009) using the onboard excursions.
Some brochures also offer cruises to Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea, and visiting the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be scary for people of all ages and conditions, especially if they have never flown before or have had some traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not dissimilar to the fears and personal aversions that many people manifest towards other things.
For some people, understanding a bit about how planes work and what happens during a flight can be helpful in overcoming a fear based on the unknown or a lack of control.
Delivery drivers are well paid to deliver products quickly. Often, timing is very important in the case of business documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
For some routes, the larger companies use their own planes, but for other routes and in the case of smaller companies, problems emerged.
On some routes, air shipments would take days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to get it there faster would be to ship it as checked luggage, and that's where you come in, since airline regulations don't allow for shipping luggage without a passenger.
To fly first or business class, the obvious way is to shell out a pretty penny for the privilege (or, even better, convince your company to do so).
However, the price to pay is high: you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for Business travel and up to eleven times the fare for first class travel!
In general, on direct flights from A to B, it is not even worth looking for discounts on first-class or business-class seats.
Airlines know there is a category of travelers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably, and they apply certain rates accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau and the local language is Romanian. However, Russian is also very widespread.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has been the site of ethnic conflict in the past.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two regions of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is Christian Orthodoxy.
Izmir is Turkey's third largest city, with a population of around 3.7 million; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important transport hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna is developed on a huge bay, is surrounded by mountains and currently constitutes a modern, evolved and active commercial center.
Although the city has a more Mediterranean European feel than traditional Turkey, wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centres are dotted with the distinctive red-tiled roofs, 18th-century market and ancient mosques and churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and you can visit a unique octagonal church.
In the churchyard, on some of the graves, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
Half an hour is enough to walk around the charming village.
To the north is the romantic and charming town of Sintra, which is easily accessible. It became famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to the brilliant account of its splendors written by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb 403 bus service runs regularly to Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north, visit the great sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (place of worship), a place of Marian apparitions famous all over the world.
Remember that the site you are visiting is essentially a mass grave, and it has an almost incalculable significance to a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived these places, and many others who saw their loved ones murdered or worked to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Avoid jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Avoid defacing these places by marking the structures with signs or graffiti.
In the city of Barcelona, the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority is able to understand it; Spanish is known by practically everyone.
However, most of the signs are written exclusively in Catalan, which is the first official language by law.
Spanish, however, is also widely used for public transport and other services.
On the metro, regular announcements are only in Catalan. Any unscheduled service interruptions are communicated in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese, thanks to an automatic system.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and arrogant.
Even if it is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to feel at ease in Paris is still to behave in the best possible way, relating to people as a "bien Ã©levÃ©" (well-educated) person. This will definitely make your travels easier.
The gruff exterior of Parisians will quickly disappear if you show some basic good manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is rich in forests, mainly beech, pine and fir, and is characterized by a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a variety of microclimates, soils and altitude levels, it presents a great variety of plant communities.
The area is also home to a huge variety of animal and bird species.
Rare species such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and capercaillie live in these places, alongside several other more widespread animal species.
When visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and to cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide stoles for women who arrive unprepared, but if you already have one, especially if it's brightly colored, you'll earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long pants down to their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the store at the entrance; however, the garments are not washed after each user, so wearing these skirts may not be comfortable. For men, a one-size-fits-all!
The cuisine of Majorca, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
Pa amb Oli is a simple, popular summer dish: bread with olive oil, tomato and any condiments available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the pronoun "Sie" used for the polite form of "du" (you), always begin with a capital letter, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This represents an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
This aspect probably also facilitates reading, although the need to understand whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantivized form makes the writing rather complex.
Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most words are pronounced the way they are spelled.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation changes depending on the vowel that follows.
Also, make sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: caro means dear, while carro means carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar manual could help you a lot with Persian grammar and understanding sentences.
It goes without saying that if you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with a basic knowledge of the Spanish language may come to the hasty conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore does not need to be studied separately.
Nowadays, pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete and serve as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution was not a problem during their heyday, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, which are more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge structures in remote areas where the atmospheric conditions are favorable.
Admiring the cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where the flowering of plum trees was preferred.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were organized by the emperor just for himself and other members of the aristocracy close to the imperial court.
Plants give their best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "just" one specimen.
If you visit an Italian garden, even picking up a few specimens of plants will cost you removal from this place, without discussion.
In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy city to navigate; you can buy pretty much anything once you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics," just a few degrees north of the equator, you'll have to contend with (always) hot weather and strong sun (more rarely, when the sky is clear).
Some buses also head north, towards Hebron, the traditional site where the Bible's patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives, were buried.
Make sure the bus you want to take goes inside Hebron and doesn't stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great theme around which to organize a holiday.
For example, you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, take a cruise to visit the interesting cities on the Danube or sail on the Erie Canal.
In addition, they define the routes of very well-known hiking trails and bike paths.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
A tradition involves spending Easter night staying awake in an open place to be able to admire the dawn.
There are of course Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual linked to spring and fertility.
In more traditional churches, an Easter Vigil is often held on the Saturday night of the Easter weekend, with congregations often starting the ceremony at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally came to the islands arrived by swimming, flying or floating.
Since the distance from the mainland was considerable, mammals were unable to make the journey, which meant that the giant tortoise became the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Numerous mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs and cats were introduced to the Galapagos after the arrival of humans.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic territories during the winter, you can experience the polar night, when the sun remains below the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the possibility of witnessing the Northern Lights, because the sky remains dark almost all day.
Since the territories are sparsely populated, light pollution is often not a problem and you can also enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners tend to be used to.
Office wear usually consists of a jacket and tie or a suit, and colleagues are addressed by their surname or professional title.
The harmony of the workplace is of crucial importance, as it emphasizes the commitment of the group rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to get the approval of their superiors for every decision, and are expected to follow instructions without question.
