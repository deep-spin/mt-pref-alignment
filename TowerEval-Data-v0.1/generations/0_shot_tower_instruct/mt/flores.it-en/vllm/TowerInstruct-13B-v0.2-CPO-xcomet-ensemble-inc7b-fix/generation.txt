"We have mice that were diabetic for four months and now they are not diabetic anymore," he added.
The study is still in its early stages, as cautioned by Dr. Ehud Ur, a professor of medicine at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and director of the clinical and scientific department of the Canadian Diabetes Association.
Like other experts, he is sceptical about the possibility of curing diabetes, stressing that these results are not relevant for those already affected by type 1 diabetes.

USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes the absolute necessity for the Olympic community to work together to create a safe environment for all of its athletes.
We agree with the USOC that the best interests of our athletes and our clubs, and the sport itself, are best served by pursuing meaningful change within our organization, not by decertification.
USA Gymnastics has launched an independent investigation to understand how abuse of the scale described so bravely by those who have survived Larry Nassar could have been hidden for so long, and is committed to implementing any necessary or appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the same goal: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible, so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a reliable, positive and responsible environment.

This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely accepted, but provides more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was brownish-tan on the top, with a pale or carotenoid coloration on the bottom.
The discovery also allows for detailed information about the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the dinosaur's plumage does not have the basic structure, the so-called rachis, but instead has other features typical of feathers, barbs and barbules, the researchers concluded that the rachis is probably the result of an evolutionary development subsequent to these features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or courtship. The researchers hypothesize that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not the down of a chick.
According to the researchers' hypotheses, despite the fact that the tail belongs to a young dinosaur, the sample reveals plumage from an adult specimen and not that of a chick.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two officers and injuring over twenty people.

They discovered that the functioning of the Sun is based on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the solar system is determined by nothing other than their luminosity and rotation.
Brightness is used together with rotation to define a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is compared to magnetic reversals.

The activity carried out was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the surveys carried out of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect sought by the team was to be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a force of attraction on Earth that generates tides, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to deduce that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same effects that "normal" matter has.
This theory suggests that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is collected in a kind of halo, made up of a multitude of small particles.
Television reports show white smoke coming out of the plant.
Local authorities are warning people living near the plant to stay indoors, turn off air conditioning and not drink tap water.

Dr Tony Moll has identified extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal.
According to a statement released in an interview, this new variant was "highly concerning and alarming, due to the high mortality rate".
According to Dr Moll, some patients may have contracted the microbe inside the hospital, and at least two of them were healthcare workers at the hospital itself.
Over the course of a year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 close contacts.
Nevertheless, the proportion of XDR-TB in the whole group of people with tuberculosis still seems low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at one time in South Africa.

The government has also promised several million vials of vaccine against encephalitis, so that next year health facilities are not caught unprepared.
Delivery plans for vaccines in historically hard-hit areas this year have been delayed due to a lack of funding and because they were given a low priority compared to other diseases.

Following the construction of the dam in 1963, the seasonal floods that spread sediment along the river course stopped.
This sediment has been fundamental in the creation of both beaches and sandbanks that have become habitats for wildlife.
As a result, two species of fish have become extinct and two others are at risk of extinction, including the humpback goby.
Although the flood will only raise the water level by a few metres, the authorities hope that it will be enough to restore the sandbanks eroded further downstream.

Infrared images show thermal oscillations between day and night, demonstrating that they are probably caves.
During the day they are colder than the surrounding surface and at night they are warmer.
Glen Cushing of the US Geological Survey's astrogeology team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona, said: "Their thermal behaviour is not consistent with that of large terrestrial caves, which often maintain a relatively stable temperature, but is consistent with being deep holes in the ground."
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters enter a secluded booth and put a pre-printed sheet indicating their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After his identity is verified by the officials, the voter deposits the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral register.
The French electoral law codifies the procedures in a rather strict manner.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers can witness that at the beginning of the vote there are no envelopes present and that no other envelopes are inserted other than those of the voters, duly counted and authorized.
Candidates can send their representatives to attend every stage of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, in accordance with specific procedures.

The victims were Nicholas Alden, 25, and the driver, Zachary Cuddeback, 21.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider will have to undergo facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's weapon did not explode when it was pointed at a fifth man. Schneider has constant pain, is blind in one eye, is missing a section of skull and his face has been reconstructed in titanium.
Schneider testified via videoconference from a USAF base in his country.
In addition to Wednesday's event, Carpanedo competed in two individual races at the Championships.
The first in the slalom, where at the first descent he recorded a DNT. Another 36 competitors out of 116 in the same race did not complete the test.
The other race she participated in, the giant slalom, saw her finish tenth in the women's group of the "sitting" category, with a combined time of 4:41.30, slower by 2:11.60 minutes than the first-placed Austrian Claudia Loesch, and slower by 1:09.02 minutes than the ninth-placed Hungarian GyÃ¶ngyi Dani.
Four female skiers in the downhill group failed to finish their runs, and 45 of the 117 participants in the Giant Slalom did not qualify for the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police managed to recover the laptop and mobile phone that had been stolen.
The deputy inspector general, DK Arya, announced: "Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman. We have also found her mobile phone and her laptop."
The names of the accused are: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
None of the three people who were in the house at the time of the car crash were injured.
Nevertheless, the driver was seriously injured to the head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
From that moment, Adekoya is at the sheriff's court in Edinburgh charged with killing his own son.
She is being held pending trial and trial, but any testimony from an eyewitness could be tainted, as her image has been widely published.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice has other parameters. The Scottish courts have in fact deemed the publication of the photos potentially prejudicial.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee, "journalists who publish photos or other material of suspects are walking on a minefield".
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecutions, told reporters there would be no further comment until at least the formal charge.
According to leaks, the subject of the document will be the dispute over borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders existing before the Middle East War of 1967.
According to what is being said, the other issues addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement was signed, Israel demanded a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agreed to abandon this presence for only five years.
The shooters within the experimental program for the control of harmful animals had to be carefully monitored by the rangers, since the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program, the NPWS, in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., has recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive training and safety instructions.
Yesterday Martelly was sworn in to a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth provisional electoral council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission proposed a package of measures aimed at pushing the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests, which began in October, against the regime.
The occasionally violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were scheduled as early as 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of malfunctioning iPods have been reported, which caused a total of six fires and caused minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has stated that it is aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of another 34 incidents related to overheating, which the company described as "not serious".
In its response, the ministry called Apple's delay in submitting the report "absolutely deplorable."
The earthquake in the Mariana Islands was felt at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office, no damage has been reported in the nation.
And furthermore, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no signs of a tsunami in progress.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino policeman took tourists from Hong Kong hostage after hijacking their bus.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Many of the hostages were saved, at least six have died.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were immediately released along with the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was fatally shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
After completing her midwifery training, she began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, in his free time Liggins began studying cases of premature labor.
His research showed that the administration of a hormone would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two "black boxes" with flight recordings.
Even his fellow wrestlers wanted to pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, just like her. A strong woman."
"Luna was as strange as me... Maybe even more so... I love her and I will miss her... Let's hope she's in a better place," was the comment of Dustin "Goldust" Runnels.
According to a survey conducted on 1,400 people before the 2010 federal elections, people opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, the then acting prime minister, Julia Gillard, said she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
This view is shared by 34% of those surveyed, who believe that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
At the opposite end of the survey, 29% of respondents support the idea that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% are of the opinion that it should never become one.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100 and 200 metre freestyle and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but has suffered from several ailments that have cast doubt on her fitness.
He was unable to take the medication necessary to overcome the pain because it is banned from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever known to date.
The discovery was verified by multiple people using different hardware and software in early February, and was announced Tuesday.
Comets could have been one of the sources that brought water and organic matter to Earth, that is, matter capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and in particular how the Earth formed, having collided with comets a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, has been in office since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he signed a law that makes same-sex marriage legal.
According to him, speculation is nothing more than "chatter and political nonsense".
A presidential candidacy in 2016 is being considered.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow planes to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, thereby reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system uses satellite technology instead of the outdated ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being arranged and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, while there are no car parks or interchange parking available on site.
The fears linked to the absence of transportation have brought to light the possibility of playing the match behind closed doors, without the support of the team's fans.
According to a study published on Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of bird has emerged on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers from Princeton University, USA, and Uppsala University, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that the time required for this process was much greater; this was due to the mating between a Darwin endemic finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into any shape. It can be rolled up to create tiny shapes.
It can be drawn out to form a thin wire, suitable for twisting and braiding. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. Sometimes it has been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts" precisely because of the possibility of being made so thin.
This is the so-called pH of the substance. Using red cabbage juice, it is possible to construct a pH indicator.
The juice of the cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
The pH level of the chemical being analyzed is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the H in pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electrons (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dried powders together and then, with clean, wet hands, roll them into a ball.
Between the moisture on your hands and the outer layers, a reaction will occur that will cause a strange sensation and form a sort of shell.
Almost all the houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with running water connected to an advanced sewage system.
In Greece, remains of sewage systems have been discovered in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini.
In ancient times, toilets also existed in Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, they were sometimes included in public baths, frequented by a mixed public of men and women.
To call someone thousands of miles away, a satellite is used.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space using a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts light and vision to some extent.
To transport a satellite or a telescope into space, a rocket more than 100 feet tall is needed.
The wheel has greatly changed the world. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important is that it has provided us with simpler and faster transportation.
Thanks to his invention, the train, the automobile and several other means of transportation made their appearance.
Below them are other medium-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including domestic cats in the wild) that feed on much smaller prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The concept of niche is the secret of their success, a particular goal that every feline has and that allows them not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in large groups called prides.
The packs are composed of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and cubs that can reach 30.
Usually the females are closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The pack of lions acts in a very similar way to the pack of wolves or dogs, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not to that of other big cats), even as regards the deadly attacks on their prey.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (albeit not very well), swim, make very long jumps and exert a pulling force five times greater than that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard and jaguar. These four big cats are the only ones that roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as that of the lion, but it resembles a sentence of shouted and angry words.
Ocelots love to feed on small animals. If possible, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds and almost all the prey they catch are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find their food (prey) thanks to their sense of smell, sniffing the ground where they have been.
Thanks to their night vision, they are able to see very well in the dark, in addition to being able to move stealthily. To hunt their prey, ocelots camouflage themselves with the surrounding environment and then pounce on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population to which it belongs (for example, if it moves beyond a mountain range or a river, or moves to a new island, thus making it difficult for it to return), it will probably find itself in a different environment from the one it was in before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, so, in order to be a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations than those needed previously.
The indigenous population has not changed at all; it continues to need the same adaptations as before.
As time goes by and the new population adapts to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists of the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and is a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide expelled by humans (through exhalation).
Plants process their own food with the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and we make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is made from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the superpredator of its era and for this reason it feared nothing, except for other mosasaurs.
More than 70 razor-sharp teeth protruded from its long jaws, plus an additional row on the palate, so there was no escape for anyone who crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that it had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and it's also possible that it was a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex would not have been able to compete with it.
Although much of their food would be familiar to us, Roman banquets also included some strange or unusual dishes, such as wild boar, peacock, snails and a type of rodent called a ghiro.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate while sitting on chairs, rich men loved to feast together while lying on their side while consuming their meal.
Of course, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include various foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each deity, which was considered the dwelling place of the god.
People made sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to provide for the needs of the deities through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built and became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
Thanks to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, the house was not of fundamental importance.
Much of Jewish family life took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard, while the shops were simple outdoor counters that faced the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Nordic sagas, it is said that Erik the Red gave it its name, having encountered Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But, regardless of its discovery, at that time the Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although they are all "Scandinavian" countries, the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you have seen the movie "National Treasure", you might think that there is a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is false. Even if something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription "Original Declaration of Independence July 4, 1776." The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence, the large parchment document (measuring 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Therefore, the annotation was probably only added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles had brought liberation to northern France, but the south was still occupied.
It was governed by the Vichy regime, that is, by those French who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and had allied themselves with the invaders, instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France: this offensive action was called "Operation Dragoon".
American and Free French forces had liberated southern France in just two weeks and were heading towards Germany.
By civilization we mean a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, constituting a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis", which means civil; the term is in turn connected with "civis", that is citizen, and "civitas", that is city or city-state, and in a certain way therefore also defines the dimensions of society.
City-states are the first entities to anticipate the idea of nation. Culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge through multiple generations, leaving an indelible cultural imprint through fair diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical traces, and are therefore not recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states formed for the first time a weak central government, and Congress was the only component of it, according to the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes and, given the absence of an executive or judicial power at the national level, it relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, for the enforcement of its acts.
It didn't even have the authority to bypass tax laws and tariffs between states.
To change the articles required the unanimous consent of all the states. These for their part had so little regard for the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German team, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are: football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 car races.
Winter sports are more widespread in the northern regions and see Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
From a geographical point of view, Japan is referred to as an "archipelago", given the presence of groups of islands that make it up.
Taiwan was born in the 15th century, when European sailors passing through the area recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
The Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan in 1624, beginning a transformation that affected the aborigines' cereal production systems and hiring Chinese laborers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan came under the control of the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, thus ceding sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan; the island remained under Japanese rule until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the peripheral buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30% of the Machu Picchu site had been recovered, but restoration work is still ongoing.
The most common format in the world for still photography, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the most commonly used film at the end of the era of analog photography.
It is still produced today and, more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strangely, the height of the 35mm format is 24mm and its width is 36mm.
The proportions of this format (divide by twelve to get the simplest ratio of whole numbers) are therefore considered to be 3:2.
The proportions of many of the common formats (for example the APS family of formats) are equal to or very close to this value.
The much-abused and often derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a sense of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point to place the main subject corresponds to the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
At this stage in European history, the Catholic Church, having become wealthy and powerful, found itself under scrutiny.
The Christian religion had acted as a glue between European states for over a thousand years, despite linguistic and cultural differences.
Its ubiquitous power influenced everyone, from the king to the common citizen.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary reserves exist for this very reason.
The central authority of the church has remained in Rome for over a thousand years and this convergence of power and money has led many to wonder if this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective: it involved the interruption of any essential military and civilian supplies, despite the fact that this blockade violated international law, which is usually accepted and codified by multiple international treaties of the last two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent any vessel from accessing entire sections of the ocean, putting neutral ships at risk as well.
As this tactic had elicited a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its indiscriminate submarine warfare campaign.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer from the Edison Company in New York City and this led him to move to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his boss in his previous job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different periods of time were named in a very unique way: each period of China or each family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
Even the intervals between individual dynasties were characterized by periods of instability and division between the provinces. The most well-known was the so-called Three Kingdoms period, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
During these periods, fierce wars broke out between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent eras in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting to secure a place of honor in the imposing palace of Xi'an.
The social and political effects are numerous, among them we can mention the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republic, nationalism and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and is not the property of a single sovereign.
Moreover, after the Revolution, professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same goes for the military, as army rankings, instead of being based on class, are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers in various countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters beyond this life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, offers a very clear image of the spirituality of Mohammed.
The cave rests atop one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely detached from the rest of the world.
In reality, it is not at all easy to find, even if its existence was known. Once inside the cave, the isolation is total.
You can see nothing but a wonderful clear sky and a lot of mountains around. From inside the cave you can see or hear very little of the surrounding world.
Among the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one that has survived to this day without being in ruins.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramidal structures built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, is home to numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), various smaller tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The important pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the Pharaoh's wives and family members.
The "arc up" indication looks like a V and the "arc down" indication looks like a paperclip or a square without the bottom side.
Upward means that you should start from the tip and push the bow, and downward means that you should start from the nock (which is where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow towards yourself.
An upward bow usually generates a softer sound, while with a downward bow a stronger and more decisive sound is produced.
You can decide to add your own personalized markings with a pencil, but keep in mind that the signs of the archeggio that you find printed have a musical value, so in general they should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of market women forced King Louis XVI, in a state of terror, to leave Versailles and return to Paris, along with Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, 11 years old, and Louis Charles, 4 years old), and Elizabeth, the king's sister.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and screaming threats against the monarchs.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The war expenses of US imperialism incurred to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover a good part of the expenses and the interest on the bonds fluctuated in the name of the Philippine government through the banking institutions of Wall Street.
Clearly, the enormous profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the profits underlying US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history that covers the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (from the year 1000 to 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or the technological imperative to the strict sense according to which the fate of man is driven by an underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the automobile necessarily involves the development of the road network.
However, a national road network for only a few cars is not economically sustainable, so new methods of production are being developed to reduce the costs associated with owning a car.
The mass possession of cars also leads to a higher percentage of accidents on the roads, and consequently the invention of new techniques for the care of injured people.
Romanticism was characterized by a substantial component of cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography has conditioned individuals, and over time, customs, habits and culture linked to such geography have emerged, which, being in harmony with the context of society, have proved more effective than laws imposed arbitrarily.
Similarly to Paris, known today as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital in feudal Europe.
Its fame as a nerve center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until around 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century its prestige declined, mainly because the crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of Gothic style was reached in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the east.
But the slowness of the communication routes means that the spread of styles in the West can be delayed by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the time, as a result of the Crusades, was the introduction of buttons to fasten clothes.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence when it is practiced solely for the purpose of producing enough to meet the food needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, usually organic, that uses seeds preserved from the original ecological region in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at getting the most out of the harvest.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and in many developing countries this is still the case.
Subcultures bring together individuals with the same opinions, who do not feel represented by society's standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished based on the age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics that define a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic or a combination of factors.
Often members of a subculture indicate their membership through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, manners and slang.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyze some unfortunate cases of children who, due to negligence, misfortune, or the effect of intentional abuse, have grown up without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "feral" or wild. Some of them have been segregated by people (often their own parents): in some cases, the abandonment is motivated by the refusal of a serious intellectual or physical disability on the part of the parents.
Feral children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Other children may have been raised by animals; still others seem to have lived alone in the wild.
When the feral child is totally raised by non-human animals, it shows behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the particular animal that took care of it, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Project-based learning should make learning itself easier and more interesting, while scaffolding goes a bit further.
Scaffolding is not a mode of learning, but rather an aid for those who undertake a new learning experience, such as the use of a new computer program or the start of a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "scaffolding", but so is the little paperclip assistant in Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to question, prompt and explain the procedures that the student may have had difficulty managing on their own.
Children are given into foster care for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, if not outright extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that does not guarantee them nourishment, care and education, but it happens to them.
We believe that foster care represents a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to meet all the needs not met in the home from which they were removed.
The Internet brings together some elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the theory of uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord's (1998) study of audience reactions to Web sites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships."
The use of video recording has allowed significant discoveries to be made in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that it is possible to tell if a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks illustrated how people who are unable to understand spoken language due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even argues that these abilities to interpret human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research has shown the existence of two pools of genetic variability, namely hidden variability and expressed variability.
With mutation, a new genetic variability is added, with selection it is eliminated from the pool of expressed variability.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute the variability back and forth between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to meet their amino acid requirements with the plant resources available in the savannah.
Furthermore, the failure to carry out such activities has serious consequences: slowed growth, malnutrition, and, ultimately, even death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us they are difficult to digest, unless they are cooked.
Animal foods, on the other hand (such as ants, termites, and eggs), are not only easy to digest, but provide a high amount of protein, containing all essential amino acids.
In light of all this, it should come as no surprise that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional waking that occurs during the normal sleep period, followed by a return to sleep (10â€“60 minutes later).
This process can be easily implemented by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to a state of consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you decide to reset the alarm clock while sleeping, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you will be forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options focused on the biorhythm involve consuming a lot of liquids before going to bed (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which forces you to get out of bed to urinate.
A person enjoys inner peace in proportion to the tension existing in his body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force that exists. Each of us has the potential ability to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. This goal is only hindered by our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been enriched by the path of love of the Mahayana ritual and by various techniques of Indian yoga.
In general, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It is based on Kundalini Yoga, meditation and a path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini Yoga activates the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) through the use of yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the core of Tibetan meditation. Through the representation of various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is developed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, systemic, procedural, and cultural conflicts caused a break between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies had become enemies; the Cold War had begun.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought for real, by mercenary armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other countries.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been breached; the only option was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans, however, proved to be immediately obsolete, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Using ships for the transport of goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the navies has always been to guarantee the country the safeguarding of its ability to move people and goods, while at the same time countering the same ability of enemies to move their people and goods.
One of the more recent examples supporting this theory and most notably is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. During the battle, the Americans were trying to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to support Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, tried to disrupt this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have had the chance to conquer Great Britain, just as it had done in the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
They began to be raised by the cultures and tribes of antiquity to have milk, wool, meat and skin readily available.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that were allowed to roam freely on hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goatherds (similar to shepherds) who were often children or teenagers. These methods of herding are still used today.
In the 16th century, wagonways were already built in England.
Despite being simply formed of parallel wooden planks, the wagonways, when compared to the slightly more rugged roads of the period, allowed the horses that travelled on them to reach higher speeds and to move heavier loads.
The sleepers were introduced relatively early to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was understood that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
It became a common practice, even though the iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels gave way to iron ones. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron appeared.
The first means of transportation that mankind has known were legs. Humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means "upright man").
Its predecessor, the australopithecus, did not habitually walk upright.
Signs of specialization for bipedal locomotion are present in the fossils of Australopithecus dating back to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate future suffering to some extent, we can start adopting more environmentally friendly lifestyles, we can join the environmental movement and even do activism.
In many cases this only works as a symptomatic treatment. If we do not want just a temporary solution, we should find the ultimate cause of the problems and disable it.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity, while problems have increased due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
After Congress adopted it on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to the printing office of John Dunlap a few blocks away.
In the night between 4 and 5 July, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, today known as "The Dunlap broadsides".
The document was first read publicly on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall and the task was entrusted to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops stationed in New York on July 9, while a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 shots of Dunlap that are still known are the oldest existing copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
According to many paleontologists today, a category of dinosaurs survived and is still alive. They are the ones we call birds.
Many tend not to consider them dinosaurs because of their feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds have many features that link them to dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on their hind legs.
Ultimately, the manipulation of information encoded as binary numbers is at the heart of all computers used today.
A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and in computer terminology these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately evident. Its symptoms, including vomiting, are very general, making it impossible to make an immediate diagnosis.
The main indication of internal poisoning could be the presence in the house of an open container of drugs or harmful chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions specific to that poison.
The term mite is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the familiarity in ancient times with bed bugs, insects that have strongly adapted to become parasites of humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are nest dwellers, meaning they are adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States of America, multiple sclerosis (MS) accounts for about 400,000 known cases, placing it at the top of the list of neurological diseases that affect young people and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
The research has highlighted that the probability of developing MS among females is double that of males.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child.
These couples have the option to choose an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the natural parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific inquiry.
But it is not just about experimentation, since an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also allows us to guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's opinions on various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the gradual decline of the Greek language, the West was isolated from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior are critically dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just reactions to periodic external signals, have been documented in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, which are viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments by labeling the bacteriophage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a range of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells are in the germ line.
The mutations that can be passed on to children are only those at the level of the germ cells; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including the flora and wildlife.
Examples of activities to do on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visits to parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
For example, by visiting, photographing and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns to drive to work, crossing paths with others whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic comings and goings, everyone is somehow connected to a transportation system based on private cars, which they also support.
Today science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere outside of one of its conditions of stability that has allowed human evolution over the last two million years.
Every person participates in social life and uses transport systems, which almost everyone complains about.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges falling into disrepair.
Why do transport systems attract so many complaints, why are they rejected every day? Are the engineers who design them incompetent, or are there deeper reasons?
The "Traffic Flow" is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and the interactions that they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, driver behavior tends to fall within a reasonably constant range, so, in turn, traffic flows tend to show reasonable constancy and can be represented generically in mathematical terms.
To obtain a more accurate representation of the traffic flow, the three main variables were correlated: (1) flow rate, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for planning, designing and managing road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. The ability to fly allowed them to escape enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects are helped by the ability to fold their wings along their body.
This allows them to exploit a greater variety of small crevices to hide from predators.
Of all the insects that exist today, the only ones that are not able to fold their wings are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the sun.
For some, he was right, but many others believed the opposite, that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and even the other stars), moved around the Earth.
Which makes sense, because we don't have the feeling that the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the largest river and the second longest river on Earth. It carries a volume of water equal to 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with a width that in some places reaches six miles.
20% of the total water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It receives the waters of thousands of smaller tributaries.
Stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of their size and technical excellence in their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom remained enchanted by the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is made up of around 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the one with the smallest population.
The language of Vatican City for legislation and official communications is Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most people working within the state, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
In Vatican City, all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man began to know the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper already in ancient times: these elements can be found in nature in their native form and can be extracted quite simply with the help of primitive tools.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is composed of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
These in fact resemble the four states of matter, namely (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma. However, he also theorized that they transformed into new substances, forming what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains numerous elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There may also be alloys composed of minimal amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly tiny, so many trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
After its invention, the pencil has therefore proved to be a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and less widespread use.
Today everyone writes messages on computer screens and they never have the need to get close to a typewriter.
We can only wonder what fate the keyboard will meet when something newer comes along.
The principle that energy is required to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is the basis of the functioning of the fission bomb.
In practice, it's like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. So, by further dividing the nucleus, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break apart in the presence of little or no force.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the side closest to us and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under mountainous areas.
The Maria may be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner. This has facilitated the rise of lava to the surface.
Theories of content are focused on finding what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what unites certain people and drives them to want to do what they do, and what are the contextual factors in which they live that push them to do or not do certain things.
Among the most popular theories on content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, when managers start to manage their former colleagues, two behaviours can emerge. On the one hand, there are those who try to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, to implement disciplinary actions, to evaluate performance, and to define and assign responsibilities.
At the other extreme, the manager becomes a completely different person, who feels that they have to change the entire way the team operates and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is the person who is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often generates disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence for virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with some minor differences.
Members of the virtual team often serve as a point of contact for their physical next group.
They often have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as meetings can take place according to different time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The existence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
The management team is referred to as the "invisible team" and is the one to which each member refers and is the one that sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization want to go through the long process of building a learning organization? A good reason for implementing organizational learning concepts may be innovation.
When all available resources can be effectively utilized across all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the path of collaboration within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
For an organization to be considered innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates the continuum theory as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
The neurobiological results have demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. The area of research becomes narrower and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is the basis of the research of scientists.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors can affect behavior and change certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been observed before.
This gives us a wealth of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Despite having a strong science fiction connotation, AI represents a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research on AI includes the development of machines to automate operations that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples of application are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as recognition of writing, vocal and facial expressions.
These things have become distinct disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as well as being integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
Trips are a fundamental part of the curriculum. Often, teachers would like to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution is offered by technology with virtual tours. Students can see the artifacts of museums, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great opportunity to share experiences and travel reflections with future classes.
For example, each year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned each year, but previous versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. In fact, their first experiences with blogs are often characterized by poor grammar and spelling, but the presence of an audience usually changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative judgments, the blog author is committed to improving their writing.
Blogs also "force students to become more aware of the moment around them." The need to keep the audience interested motivates students to be ingenious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop students' learning well beyond the normal school day.
The proper use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to materials on the Internet, students can define their position within the writings of others, as well as delineate their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming and bilingual capital of Canada, full of art galleries and museums that tell the past and present of the country.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and to the north you can admire the natural and unspoiled beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All of this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian according to the opinions of foreigners.
The wide areas further north are sparsely populated, among which some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
If you compare the population, the result may be surprising for many: in the United States, the number of African-American citizens is higher than that of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a continent in its own right.
Almost all the smaller islands, known as luxurious seaside resorts, are mostly independent nations or associated with France.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, which then began a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape Route, which goes from Europe to India, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama paved the way for European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is delimited by the Sahel, while to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
For women travelers: it is recommended that all women declare that they are married, regardless of their actual civil status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassment, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Have the strength to refuse men, and don't be afraid to oppose them (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; under the name of Anfa, it was a strategically important port used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it with the name Casa Branca, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city, which was called Daru l-Badya, then renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who chose these places for their commercial bases.
Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and lots of trinkets, but all of this is reserved only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying much of the city's roads, especially those in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is advisable to do your research before undertaking any visits outside of Goma, so as to assess the state of the ongoing clashes in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the climb up the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the less expensive opportunities to see the mountain gorillas of Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around in Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Also as a result of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has ended up becoming a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today Timbuktu is a decaying city, but for its reputation it remains a tourist attraction, also equipped with an airport.
In 1990 it was included in the list of UNESCO World Heritage sites that are in danger, due to the threat posed by the desert sands.
It was one of the main stops in Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World".
With its more Arab than African feel, the city stands out from the others in the country.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeast South Africa and stretches east along the border with Mozambique, to the north it borders Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
With an area of 19,500 kmÂ², the park includes 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different wildlife population.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the most important of the South African national parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, daily conservation fees and park entry fees apply.
Purchasing a Wild Card could also be useful, as it allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The Island of Hong Kong, which gives its name to the entire territory, is the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings that form the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a sparkling bar chart, even more evident because framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the waterfront of Kowloon opposite.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development has been concentrated on the reclaimed land of the northern coast, which is densely populated.
This is the place that the English colonizers chose for themselves, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this land, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove littoral belt in the world. It extends for 80 km (50 mi) from the coast inland in Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest included in Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only made up of mangrove swamps: they also contain what remains of the impressive jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 kmÂ², of which about a third is made up of marshy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a wildlife sanctuary; it is estimated that there are 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang) depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
As the buses that run between different districts are often full, it is a good idea to buy your ticket a few days in advance.
Most neighborhoods are served by convenient and sturdy little Japanese buses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby locations, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, in Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
Its two pylons are 83 metres high, it is 378 metres long and has two lanes 3.50 metres wide.
Under the bridge, the free vertical space is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but the opening to traffic only took place in March 2017.
In September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge should be fully operational.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group living in present-day eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and the PayaguÃ¡, who lived off hunting, gathering and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
Since the founding of AsunciÃ³n in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its indigenous identity and characteristics.
Everyone knows that Argentina has one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the most important tournament of the year takes place in the polo fields of Las CaÃ±itas.
Here you can watch minor tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and purchasing tickets for polo matches, contact the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The Falklands have their own official currency, the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to the British pound (GBP).
The only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store, offers currency exchange services.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands. In Stanley, you can often pay with credit cards and US dollars.
It is likely that credit cards will not be accepted on the outlying islands, although British and US currencies may be accepted. Check with the owners in advance to decide on an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so change your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months, temperatures over 30Â°C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the feeling of a temperature lower than that indicated by the thermometer.
There are no defined "dry" and "rainy" seasons: the amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year.
Even though many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park authorities recommend keeping a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals.
No matter how docile they may seem: bison, elk, deer, bears, practically all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured for not keeping an adequate distance. It is necessary to leave these animals an adequate space as they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Also, be aware that smells can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking food with strong odors, and try to keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoa Islands. It is located on the island of Upolu and its population is just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In this port, the infamous naval blockade of 1889 took place, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the paramount chief.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is located between two harbors. The most popular ones are divided into three areas.
The Pacific Ocean beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are mainly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook the Waitemata Harbour.
These are family-friendly beaches that can get a bit crowded at times, surrounded by a wide range of shops. It is safe to swim here.
The most well-known local beer is a simple, pleasant and refreshing beer called "Number One". The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can have many French wines, but the Australian and New Zealand ones might better withstand the journey.
The tap water in the area is totally safe to drink, but if you are worried, bottled water is easy to find.
According to the Australians, the 'flat white' coffee comes from a foreign idea. The 'espresso' is a short black coffee, the cappuccino is covered in cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is on the same level as the Belgian one. The fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Throughout the year, many excursions are made on the coral reef and injuries due to one of these causes on the coral reef are rare.
Always ask the authorities for advice, follow their instructions and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Cubomedusae appear from October to April near the beaches and estuaries of the rivers north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside of this period they can only be found occasionally.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks fear humans and tend to keep their distance.
The habitat of saltwater crocodiles is mainly the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton, they do not actively live in the ocean.
By booking in advance, the traveller has the peace of mind of finding a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often make agreements with certain hotels, but it is still possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages that include breakfast, transfers to/from the airport or even flight+hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to get additional documents required for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests must be submitted to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
During some music festivals, most participants decide to camp on site, considering this aspect a crucial element of the experience.
To be close to the center of the action, you need to arrive early and secure a spot close to the music.
Remember that once the music is over on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival where the music goes on until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, since crossing the ice causes rather annoying noises for those who are more exposed to it.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time to explore the city. Cruise passengers are granted visa-free entry (check conditions).
Generally, casinos do everything they can to increase the time and money spent by their guests. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer exclusive food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests in high spirits and make them stay longer.
In some establishments, alcoholic beverages are offered by the house. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and any good gambler knows how important it is to remain sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice or near-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is reduced and it is not possible to drive as when you are on clean asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you can get stuck.
Precipitation and snowdrifts, or the formation of ice or condensation on the vehicle's windows, can also reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably Africa's biggest tourist attraction and the centerpiece of many visitors' vacations.
In its popular usage, the term safari refers to land-based travel, particularly in the savannah, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to the cars, so a normal camera equipment is enough to get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes timid and for this reason it is possible to observe them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari", or "walking safari") is an excursion that can last a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2012, and some of the events will take place in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two summer Olympic Games. The first Olympics were held in 1964.
If your booking for flights and accommodation for 2020 was made before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, however, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies, as of late March 2020, do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that the cost of most of the tickets for the events will be between 2,500 Â¥ and 130,000 Â¥, while regular tickets will cost around 7,000 Â¥.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry faster. Many hotels offer the use of an iron and ironing board, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if you have one available.
Be careful not to expose fabrics to too high temperatures, to avoid shrinkage or, in the worst case, burns.
There are various ways to sanitize water, and some of these are more effective against specific risks.
In some areas, it is sufficient to boil the water for one minute, in others it takes many minutes.
The effectiveness of filters is variable, so in case of doubt it is advisable to consider purchasing bottled water from a sealed bottle from a reliable company.
Travelers may come into contact with animal parasites that are not prevalent in their home regions.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, as well as transmit poison or infections.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with force are not usually classified as harmful animals.
Duty Free purchases are an opportunity to buy products exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travellers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway between Point Marion and Fairmont is the one with the most difficult driving conditions, as it often crosses isolated areas among the vegetation.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, it is advisable to keep your eyes open, as steep slopes, narrow roads and tight bends predominate.
The speed limits posted are significantly lower than those applied in the preceding and subsequent sections (usually 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h). Their strict observance is extremely important.
Strangely, however, in this area the level of coverage of the mobile phone service is much higher than that present in other sections of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite flavorful and varied, similar to those of the neighboring Austria to the south.
Fruit desserts are a timeless classic, from those with apples available all year round to those with cherries and plums, which make their appearance during the summer.
Several German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. The most popular cakes often pair well with a cup of strong coffee.
Those who want to taste small but flavorful pastries can opt for those that, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish prepared with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can come in both "dry" and "wet" forms, depending on the amount of liquid it contains.
In northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used for curries in the inland regions; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more commonly used.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found in the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term generally refers to foods originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island, Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a series of dishes that are easy to prepare; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet and are attached to the two sides of the saddle.
They guarantee greater stability to the rider but can present safety problems due to the possibility that the rider's feet get stuck in them.
If a jockey is thrown from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged by the escaping horse. To minimise this risk, there are some safety measures that can be taken.
First of all, most knights wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather thin sole.
Later, some saddles, especially English ones, have included safety bars, which cause a leather bracket to detach from the saddle when, in the event of a fall, the rider pulls it back.
CochamÃ³ Valley: the most important climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, where a large number of huge granite walls and cliffs can be found.
The peaks of the summits include breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world are constantly tracing new routes on its walls, potentially infinite.
Snow sports such as skiing and snowboarding are very popular and involve sliding on snow using skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts many enthusiasts, sometimes even called "ski bums" who devote entire vacation periods to skiing in a particular area.
The principle behind skiing is very old: the first cave paintings depicting humans skiing date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport has its origins at least in the 17th century; in 1861, the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Ski touring: the activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski mountaineering or ski trekking.
It is related, although usually not included, to ski touring or skimo, which are practiced on steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski slope as a path similar to that of a hiker.
If conditions are good, you can cover somewhat greater distances than when walking, but only very rarely will you reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent made up of many independent countries. Normally, to travel through multiple countries, you would need to apply for a visa and go through passport control multiple times.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area functions more like a single country.
If you stay within this area, you can normally go from one border to the other without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual member countries, thus saving time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what makes an item an antique. Some tax agencies consider an item to be an antique if it is at least 100 years old.
The definition presents geographical differences with respect to the age limit, which may be lower, as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
Craft objects could be defined as antiques, even if they are more recent than similar objects produced in series.
Reindeer husbandry is an important source of livelihood for the SÃ¡mi and the culture on which this trade is based is also the basis for many other professions.
Even over time, not all SÃ¡mi have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding; some lived off fishing, hunting and similar activities, using reindeer mainly as working animals.
Today many SÃ¡mi have modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in SÃ¡pmi, the SÃ¡mi territory.
Although widely used, particularly among non-Roma people, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a misperception of Roma people.
If a travel warning is issued for the destination you are visiting, there may be consequences for your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance.
You may also be interested in the opinions of governments other than your own, but keep in mind that such opinions are aimed at the citizens of those governments.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East might encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The alerts are simply a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions reported are often superficial, generic and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Adverse weather conditions" is the general expression used to indicate any dangerous meteorological phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
Extreme weather events can occur in every part of the world, and there are different types of them, depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hailstorms, above-average precipitation and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similar to thunderstorms, tornadoes, marine whirlwinds and cyclones.
Among the meteorological phenomena of strong regional and seasonal intensity are thunderstorms, snowstorms, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travellers are advised to check the weather conditions in their area, as they may affect travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could potentially be considered a war zone must undergo professional training.
By searching on the internet for 'hostile environment course' you are likely to find the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing games, as well as many training activities on first aid and sometimes on weapons.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in nature are widespread, while there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Travellers who plan to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they have valid documents for their return journey.
The intention on the part of governments to issue passports without indications regarding sex (X) or updated documents to match a desired name and gender is variable.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept such documents is equally variable.
Even inspections at security checkpoints have become much more thorough in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Pre-operative transgender people should not have to expect to pass through checks without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
Rip currents are formed by the return flow of waves that break on the beach, often near a coral reef or similar formations.
Given the submarine topography, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current towards the open sea can form.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion while trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you are out of the current, swimming back will no longer be more difficult than normal.
Try to find an area where you won't get trapped again, or consider waiting for rescue based on your skills and whether you've been spotted.
The re-entry shock manifests itself in a shorter time than the cultural shock (since there is a shorter "honeymoon" phase), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travellers who found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes have difficulty readjusting to the culture of their home country.
When returning home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the customs of your culture of origin.
In your first experience abroad, you are likely to have encountered patient and understanding people, who are aware that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
Many people did not imagine that patience and awareness were also necessary for those returning home.
The sound and light show of the pyramid is the most interesting thing in the area for children.
Before the start of the show, it will be possible to admire the pyramids immersed in darkness and silence.
Normally you always hear the noise caused by tourists and vendors. The spectacle of sounds and lights is just like a book of stories.
The Sphinx becomes the background and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by various countries, the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the largest number of bases, of which sixteen were active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among the other islands are Livingston Island and Deception; in the latter, the caldera of a still active volcano filled with water has given rise to a magnificent natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the region located south of the peninsula and overlooking the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then re-emerge to form the Ellsworth Mountains, a 360 km chain cut in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Range, boasts the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only viable alternative.
A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a cell phone, because to make a call you must be outside with a clear view of the satellite.
The service is often used by recreational boats, including yachts, as well as by missions that require data and voice communication from a distance.
Your local phone service provider should be able to provide you with more information on connecting to this service.
One of the increasingly popular options for those planning to take a gap year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly popular among recent high school graduates, as they can take a year off before starting university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad during the gap year can actually increase the chances of resuming higher education upon returning to one's home country.
Usually, enrollment in these educational programs requires payment of a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love boating. In the "Land of a Thousand Lakes" there are also thousands of islands, both within the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht for archipelagos and lakes.
While the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This also happens in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in general it is a rather unique fact (for example, in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Many of the different Baltic cruises include a multi-day stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that it is possible to visit the historic town for two whole days, returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.
For the landing on the ground, a separate visa will not be required (from 2009) using onboard excursions.
Some brochures also offer cruises to Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be scary for people of all ages and conditions, especially if they have never flown before or have had some traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the fears and personal aversions that many people have towards other things.
For some people, understanding a bit about how planes work and what happens during a flight can be helpful in overcoming a fear based on the unknown, or on not having control.
Courier services are well paid to deliver products quickly. Often, timing is very important in the case of business documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
For some routes, the larger companies use their own planes, but for other routes and in the case of smaller companies, problems emerged.
On some routes, air shipments would have taken days for unloading and customs.
The only way to get it there faster would be to send it as checked baggage, and that's where you come in, since airline regulations don't allow for baggage to be sent without a passenger.
To fly in first class or business class, the most obvious way is to shell out a good amount of money for the privilege (or, even better, convince your company to do it).
However, the price to pay is high: you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for Business class travel and up to eleven times the fare for First class travel!
In general, on direct flights from A to B, it is not even worth looking for discounts on first class or business class seats.
The airlines know that there is a category of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably at their destination, and as a result, they apply certain rates.
The capital of Moldova is ChiÅŸinÄƒu and the local language is Romanian. However, Russian is also very widespread.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that in the past has been the scene of an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistria Republic in the eastern part of Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two regions of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is Christian Orthodox.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of around 3.7 million; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important transportation hub.
The ancient city of Izmir is built on a huge bay, surrounded by mountains, and is currently a modern, developed and active commercial center.
Although the city has an atmosphere more similar to that of Mediterranean Europe than to that of traditional Turkey, the wide avenues, buildings with glass facades and modern shopping centers are dotted with characteristic red tile roofs, the 18th-century market and ancient mosques and churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and visit a unique octagonal church.
In the churchyard, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
Half an hour is enough to walk around the charming village.
To the north lies the romantic and enchanting city of Sintra, easily accessible. It became famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to the brilliant account of its splendours written by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb 403 bus line regularly connects with Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north, visit the large sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (place of worship), a place of famous Marian apparitions known all over the world.
Remember that the site you are visiting is essentially a mass grave, and it has almost incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived these places, and many others who saw their loved ones murdered or worked to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Avoid jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Avoid defacing these places by tagging or graffitiing structures.
In the city of Barcelona, the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority is able to understand it; Spanish is known by practically everyone.
However, most signs are written exclusively in Catalan, which is by law the first official language.
Spanish, however, is widely used for public transport and other services.
On the metro, regular announcements are only in Catalan. Any unscheduled service interruptions are communicated in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese, thanks to an automatic system.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Even if it is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to feel comfortable in Paris is to behave at your best, relating to people as a "bien Ã©levÃ©" (well-educated) person. This will definitely facilitate your movements.
The rough exterior of Parisians will quickly fade away if you show off some basic good manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is rich in forests, mainly of beech, spruce and fir trees, and is characterized by a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a multiplicity of microclimates, different soils and altitude levels, it presents a great variety of plant communities.
The area is also home to a huge variety of animal and bird species.
In these places live rare species such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat and the cock of the rock, alongside several other more widespread animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and to cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide stoles for women who arrive unprepared, but if you already have one, especially if it is brightly colored, you will earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long pants that go all the way down to their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the wardrobe at the entrance; however, the clothes are not washed after each user, so wearing these skirts may not make you feel comfortable. For men, a single size for everyone!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
Pa amb Oli is a simple, popular dinner, typical of the summer season: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the condiments available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the pronoun "Sie" used for the polite form of "you", always start with a capital letter, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This represents an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
This aspect probably also facilitates reading, although the need to understand whether a verb or an adjective is used in a substantivized form makes the writing rather complex.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy since most words are pronounced as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, since their pronunciation changes depending on the vowel that follows.
Also make sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: caro means beloved, while carro means carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar manual could help you a lot with Persian grammar and in understanding sentences.
It goes without saying that if you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with a minimal knowledge of the Spanish language may come to the hasty conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore does not need to be studied separately.
Nowadays, pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete and serve as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution was not a problem during their heyday as it is today, they are usually located in cities or campuses, which are more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge structures in remote locations where atmospheric conditions are favourable.
The admiration of cherry blossom, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where the blossoming of plums was preferred.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy close to the imperial court.
Plants do best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "just" one specimen.
If you visit an Italian garden, even picking a few plants will cost you a ban from the site, no discussion.
In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy city to get around; you can buy practically anything once you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics", just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with the heat (always) and the strong sun (more rarely, when the sky is clear).
Some buses also head north, towards Hebron, the traditional place where the patriarchs of the Bible, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives were buried.
Make sure the bus you want to take goes into Hebron and does not stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
The inland waterways can be an excellent theme around which to organize a holiday.
For example, you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, take a cruise to visit the interesting cities of the Danube, or sail on the Erie Canal.
In addition, they define the routes of very well-known hiking trails and bike paths.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals in Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
One tradition involves spending the night of Easter staying awake in an outdoor location in order to admire the dawn.
There are of course Christian theological explanations behind this tradition, but it could just as well be a pre-Christian ritual linked to spring and fertility.
In more traditional churches, a Easter Vigil is often held on the Saturday night of the Easter weekend, with congregations often starting the ceremony at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands did so by swimming, flying or floating.
Because the distance from the mainland was considerable, mammals could not make the journey, which meant that the giant tortoise became the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Numerous mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs and cats were introduced to the Galapagos after the arrival of man.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic territories during the winter, you will be able to experience the polar night, when the sun remains below the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the possibility of witnessing the northern lights, because the sky remains dark almost all day long.
Since the territories are sparsely populated, light pollution often isn't a problem and you can even enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners tend to be accustomed to.
Office attire usually consists of a jacket and tie or a suit, and colleagues are addressed by their surname or professional title.
The harmony of the workplace is of crucial importance, as it emphasizes the commitment of the group rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to get approval from their superiors for every decision, and they are expected to follow instructions without asking questions.
