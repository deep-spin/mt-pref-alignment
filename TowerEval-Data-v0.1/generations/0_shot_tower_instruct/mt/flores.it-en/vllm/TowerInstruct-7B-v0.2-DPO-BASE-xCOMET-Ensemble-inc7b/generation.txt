This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely accepted, but provides more details than fossils, such as the color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was brownish-gray on top, with a pale or carotenoid coloration on the bottom.
The discovery also allows for the acquisition of detailed information regarding the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the dinosaur's feathers lack the basic structure, the so-called rachis, but instead have other features typical of feathers, barbs and barbules, the researchers concluded that the rachis is likely the result of an evolutionary development subsequent to these characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for regulating body temperature or for courtship purposes. The researchers hypothesize that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows the feathers of an adult and not those of a chick.
According to the hypotheses of the researchers, despite the tail belonging to a young dinosaur, the specimen reveals a plumage typical of an adult, and not that of a chick.

The work carried out was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the actual observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect sought by the team was to be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter in this galaxy and the dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts an attractive force on Earth that generates the tides, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same effects that "normal" matter has.
This theory suggests that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is collected in a kind of halo, formed by a multitude of small particles.

During the day they are cooler than the surrounding surface, and at night they are warmer.
Glen Cushing of the astrogeology team at the USGS and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona, stated: “Their thermal behavior is not constant like that of large underground caves, which often maintain a relatively stable temperature, but is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground.”
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters enter an isolated booth and put a pre-printed ballot into an envelope indicating their chosen candidate.
After the officials verify their identity, the voter deposits the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral register.
The French electoral law codifies the procedures in a rather rigorous manner.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers can verify that no envelopes are present at the start of the voting and that no others are added other than those of the duly counted and authorised voters.
Candidates can send their representatives to attend every stage of the process, and in the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, according to specific procedures.

This morning the chief prosecutor, Kier Starmer QC, released a statement saying that both Huhne and Pryce will be charged.
Huhne has resigned and will be replaced in government by Ed Davey MP. It is expected that Norman Lamb MP will take on the role of Minister for Business left vacant by Davey.
The appearance of Huhne and Pryce at Westminster Magistrates' Court is scheduled for 16 February.
The victims were Nicholas Alden, 25, and the driver, Zachary Cuddeback, 21.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider will need to undergo surgery to reconstruct his face.
Uka's weapon did not explode when it was aimed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider is in constant pain, is blind in one eye, has a section of his skull missing, and his face has been reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider testified via video conference from a USAF base in his home country.
In addition to the event on Wednesday, Carpanedo participated in two single races of the Championships.
She was first in the slalom, where she recorded a DNF in the first run. Another 36 competitors out of 116 in the same race did not finish the race.
The other race in which she participated, the giant slalom, saw her finish tenth in the female "seated" category, with a combined time of 4:41.30, more than 2 minutes and 11.60 seconds slower than the winner, the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and more than 1 minute and 9.02 seconds slower than the ninth-placed Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four female skiers in the women's group failed to finish their runs, and 45 of the 117 participants in the giant slalom did not qualify for the race.
The police of Madhya Pradesh were able to recover the laptop and the cell phone that had been stolen.
The Deputy Inspector General, DK Arya, announced: “Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman. We have also found her mobile phone and laptop.”
The names of the defendants are: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
None of the three people who were in the house at the time of the car crash were injured.
Despite this, the driver was seriously injured to the head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with killing her own child.
She is being held pending trial and sentencing, but any testimony given by an eyewitness could be tainted, as her image has been widely publicized.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice has different parameters. Scottish courts have in fact deemed the publication of the photos potentially prejudicial.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee, “journalists who publish photos or other information about suspects are walking on a minefield”.
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for court proceedings, has told journalists that no further comment will be made until the formal charge is made.
According to leaked information, the document will focus on the dispute over borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders that existed before the Middle East War of 1967.
According to reports, other topics discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement was signed, Israel demanded a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agreed to abandon this presence only for a period of five years.
Shooters on the experimental program for the control of noxious animals had to be carefully supervised by rangers, since the experiment was being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of the hunting program run by the Sporting Shooters Association, the NPWS has recruited qualified volunteers in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting Park Conservation and Heritage Manager of the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive training and safety instructions.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth provisional electoral council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission proposed a package of measures aimed at pushing the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP.
The commission constitutes Martelly's response to the widespread protests, which began in October, that challenge the regime.
The occasionally violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which had been scheduled since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating have been reported in malfunctioning iPods, which have caused a total of six fires and caused minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of another 34 incidents related to overheating, which the company described as "not serious."
In its response, the ministry called Apple's delay of the report "absolutely deplorable."
The earthquake in the Mariana Islands was felt at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office, no damage has been reported in the nation.
Furthermore, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no signs of a tsunami in progress.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino police officer took tourists from Hong Kong hostage after hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle, Rolando Mendoza fired on the tourists.
Many of the hostages have been saved, at least six have died.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released immediately along with the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom, and Mendoza was fatally struck.
Liggins followed in his father’s footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
After completing her training in obstetrics, she began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, in his free time Liggins began studying cases of premature labor.
His research showed that administering a hormone would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two "black boxes" with flight recordings.
Even his fellow wrestlers wanted to pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated: "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. She passed away on the night of the two moons. Unique, just like her. A strong woman."
"Luna was as weird as me... Maybe even weirder... I loved her and I'm going to miss her... Let's hope she's in a better place," commented Dustin "Goldust" Runnels.
According to a survey of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal elections, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic have increased by 8% since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, the then acting prime minister, Julia Gillard, said she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
This opinion is shared by 34% of the participants in the survey, who believe that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
On the other end of the spectrum, 29% of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe it should never become one.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100 and 200 metre freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but has suffered from a number of ailments that have raised doubts about her fitness.
She was unable to take the necessary medication to alleviate the pain because it is banned from the Games.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at Central Missouri University, discovered the largest prime number known to date.
The discovery was verified by multiple people using various hardware and software at the beginning of February, and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been one of the sources that brought water and organic matter, i.e. matter capable of forming proteins and supporting life, to Earth.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and in particular how the Earth formed, having collided with comets long ago.
Cuomo, 53, has been in office since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he signed a law that makes same-sex marriage legal.
According to him, speculation is nothing more than "political chatter and nonsense."
It is rumored that he may run for president in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow planes to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year, thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system employs satellite technology rather than the outdated ground-based radar approach, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transportation is being set up and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, while there are no available car parks or park and ride facilities in the area.
The fears related to the lack of transportation options have brought to light the possibility of having to play the game behind closed doors, without the support of the team's fans.
According to a study published on Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of bird has emerged on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that the time required for this process was much longer; this was the result of mating between a native Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and an immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into any shape. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled until it forms a thin wire, which can be twisted and interwoven. It can also be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. At times it has been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts" precisely because of its ability to be made so thin.
This is known as the pH level of the substance. Using red cabbage juice, it is possible to construct a pH indicator.
The color of the cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
The pH level of the chemical substance being analyzed is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the letter H in pH).
Hydrogen ions refer to protons from which electrons have been stripped (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dried powders together and then, with clean and wet hands, roll them into a ball.
Between the moisture on your hands and the outer layers, a reaction will occur that will cause a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
Almost all the houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with running water connected to an advanced sewage system.
In Greece, the remains of sewage systems have been discovered in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini.
Toilets also existed in ancient times in Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, they were sometimes included in public baths, frequented by a mixed public of men and women.
To call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space using a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts the light and the view.
A rocket more than 100 feet tall is needed to transport a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world enormously. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important one is that it has provided us with simpler and faster transportation.
Thanks to his invention, the train, the automobile, and several other means of transportation came into existence.
Below them are other medium-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including domestic cats that roam free) that feed on vastly more numerous prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The concept of a niche is the secret to their success, a particular goal that each feline has and that allows them not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social of all felines and live in large groups called prides.
The groups are composed of adult males, usually 2 or 3 who are related to each other, and a number of females and cubs that can reach up to 30.
Usually females are closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The pride of lions behaves in a way very similar to a pack of wolves or dogs, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not that of other big cats), even when it comes to deadly attacks on their prey.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (albeit not very well), swim, make very long jumps, and exert a pulling force five times greater than that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the genus Panthera) as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar: these four felines are the only ones that roar.
The roar of a tiger is not as powerful as that of a lion, but it more closely resembles a string of shouted, angry words.
Ocelots love to feed on small animals; if possible, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the prey they catch is much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) using their sense of smell, by sniffing out where they have been on the ground.
Thanks to their night vision, they are able to see very well in the dark, and are also able to move stealthily. To hunt their prey, ocelots blend in with their surroundings before pouncing on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population to which it belongs (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or a river, or moves to a new island, making a return unlikely), it will likely find itself in a different environment than the one it was in before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, so in order to establish itself as a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations compared to what was necessary before.
The indigenous population has not changed at all; they continue to need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which involves the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide expelled by humans (through exhalation).
Plants process their own nutrition with the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and we produce our clothes from plants. Much of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its era and for this reason it feared nothing, except for other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were filled with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an additional row located on the palate, so that anyone who crossed its path had no chance of escape.
We do not know for certain, but it is possible that it had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it is also possible that it was a cannibal.
He would attack anything that entered the water; not even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex could compete with him.
While many of their foods would be familiar to us, Roman banquets also featured several strange or unusual dishes, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a ghiro.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate while sitting on chairs, wealthy men liked to feast together while lying on their sides while consuming their meal.
Of course, the meals of ancient Romans did not include foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they did not have maize, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each deity, which was considered the dwelling place of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to provide for the needs of the deities through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built and became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
Thanks to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, housing was not of fundamental importance.
Much of the life of the Jewish family took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyards, while shops were simple stalls set up on the street; stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. According to Nordic sagas, it was Erik the Red who gave the land its name after encountering Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But, regardless of his discovery, at that time the Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Even though they were all "Scandinavian" countries, the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you saw the movie "The Da Vinci Code," you might think that a map to the treasure is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is false. Even if something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is written "Original Declaration of Independence July 4, 1776." The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not certain who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence the large parchment document (measuring 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled up in order to be stored.
Therefore, it is likely that the annotation was added merely as a label.
The landings of D-Day and the subsequent clashes had led to the liberation of northern France, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the Vichy regime, that is, by those French people who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and allied themselves with the invaders, instead of fighting against them.
On August 15th, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France: this offensive operation was called "Operation Dragoon".
American and Free French forces had liberated southern France in just two weeks and were heading towards Germany.
By civilization we mean a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, forming a society.
The word “civilization” derives from the Latin “civilis”, which means civil; the term is in turn connected to “civis”, meaning citizen, and “civitas”, meaning city or city-state, and in a certain sense it also defines the dimensions of society.
City-states are the first entities to anticipate the idea of a nation. The culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge across multiple generations, leaving an indelible cultural imprint through fair distribution.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving any significant historical traces, and are therefore not recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states formed a weak central government for the first time, with the Congress as its only component, according to the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes and, given the absence of an executive or judicial power at the national level, it relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce its acts.
He didn't even have the authority to bypass tax laws and tariffs between states.
In order to modify the articles, the unanimous consent of all states was required; these states, for their part, had so little regard for the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German team, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are: football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are more widespread in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
The Japanese archipelago comprises almost 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
From a geographical point of view, Japan is referred to as an "archipelago", due to the presence of groups of islands that make it up.
Taiwan was born in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
The Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan in 1624, initiating a transformation that involved the indigenous people's systems of cereal production and the hiring of Chinese laborers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan came under the control of the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the first Sino-Japanese war (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, thereby ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan; the island would remain under Japanese rule until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three primary structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Much of the peripheral buildings have been reconstructed to give tourists a more accurate idea of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30% of the Machu Picchu site had been recovered, but restoration work is still ongoing.
The most common format in the world for still photography, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the most commonly used film at the end of the era of analog photography.
It is still produced today, and more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strangely enough, the height of the 35 mm format is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest ratio of whole numbers) are therefore considered to be 3:2.
The proportions of many common formats (for example, the APS format family) are equal to or very close to this value.
The much-used and often derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a sense of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point to place the main subject corresponds to the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
At this stage in European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, found itself under scrutiny.
The Christian religion had acted as a glue binding European states together for over a thousand years, despite linguistic and cultural differences.
Its ubiquitous power has influenced everyone, from the king to ordinary citizens.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary reserves exist precisely for this reason.
The central authority of the church has remained in Rome for over a thousand years, and this convergence of power and money has led many to question whether this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective: it involved the interruption of any essential military and civilian supply, despite the fact that this blockade violated international law, which has been consistently upheld and codified by multiple international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any vessel from accessing entire sections of the ocean, putting even neutral ships at risk.
As this tactic had elicited a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its indiscriminate submarine warfare campaign.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer from the Edison Company in New York City, which led him to move to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his supervisor in his previous job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different periods of time were indicated in a very unique way: each period of China or each family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
Even the intervals between the individual dynasties were characterized by periods of instability and division between the provinces. The most well-known of these was the so-called period of the Three Kingdoms, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
During these periods, fierce wars broke out between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in battles to secure a place of honor in the imposing palace in Xi'an.
The social and political effects are numerous, including the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to a republic, nationalism, and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and is not the property of a single ruler.
Moreover, after the Revolution, professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same goes for the military, as army rankings are now based on caliber instead of class.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers in various countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters beyond this life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, offers in itself a very clear image of Muhammad's spirituality.
The cave sits atop one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely cut off from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find, even if you know it exists. Once inside the cave, isolation is total.
You can see nothing but a beautiful clear sky and a large number of mountains around. From inside the cave, you can see or hear very little of the surrounding world.
Among the Seven Wonders of the World, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one that has survived to this day without falling into ruin.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramidal structures built in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, is home to numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), various smaller tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The important pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Cheope, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the pharaoh's wives and family members.
The "arcata in su" indication resembles a V, and the "arcata in giù" indication resembles a staple or a square with one side missing.
Going up means you should start from the tip and push the bow, and going down means you should start from the alamaro (which is where the hand supports the bow) and pull the bow towards you.
An upward bow usually generates a softer sound, while a downward bow results in a stronger and more decisive sound.
You can decide to add your own personalized markings with a pencil, but keep in mind that the arching marks you find printed on the sheet have a musical significance, so they should generally be respected.
On October 6th, 1789, a crowd of women from the market forced King Louis XVI, overcome with terror, to leave Versailles and return to Paris, along with Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Maria Theresa and 4-year-old Louis Charles) and the king's sister, Elizabeth.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and hurling threats at the royals.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep their carriage windows wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The costs of war borne by US imperialism in order to conquer the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses, and the interest on the bonds fluctuated in the name of the Philippine government through the banking institutions of Wall Street.
Clearly, the enormous profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people formed the basis of US imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars, one must know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The era in which these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history covering the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (from 1000 to 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological innovation or the technological imperative to the narrow sense according to which the destiny of man is guided by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Many interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the automobile necessarily entails the development of the road network.
However, a national road network for just a few cars is not economically sustainable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs associated with car ownership.
The mass possession of automobiles also leads to a higher percentage of accidents on the roads, and consequently the invention of new techniques for providing first aid to injured people.
Romanticism was characterized by a strong component of cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the framework of romanticism, geography conditioned individuals, and over time customs, usages, and culture related to this geography arose, which, being in harmony with the context of society, proved to be more effective than laws imposed arbitrarily.
In a similar vein to Paris, now known as the capital of contemporary fashion, Constantinople was the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a hub of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until approximately 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century its prestige declined, mainly due to the fact that the crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of the Gothic style was reached during the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the east.
However, the slowness of communication channels means that the spread of styles in the West can be delayed by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the time, resulting from the Crusades, was the introduction of buttons for fastening clothing.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence when it is practiced solely for the purpose of producing enough to meet the food needs of the farmer/farmer's family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, usually organic, that uses seeds native to the ecological region in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at maximizing yields.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and in many developing countries this is still the case.
Subcultures unite individuals with the same opinions who do not feel represented by societal standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished based on the age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Often, members of a subculture indicate their affiliation through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most commonly used methods for explaining the importance of socialization is to analyze some unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, following misfortunes, or as a result of intentional abuse, grew up without proper socialization with adults.
These children are referred to as "feral" or wild. Some of them have been segregated by people (often their own parents): in some cases, abandonment is motivated by the parents' refusal to accept a serious intellectual or physical disability.
Feral children may have suffered serious violence or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Other children may have been raised by animals; still others seem to have lived alone in the wild.
When a feral child is fully raised by non-human animals, it shows behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely analogous to those of the particular animal that has taken care of it, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Project-based learning should make learning itself easier and more interesting, while scaffolding goes a bit further.
Scaffolding is not a mode of learning, but rather a help for those who are undertaking a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "scaffolding," but so is the little clip-shaped assistant in Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are designed to query, prompt, and explain the procedures that the student may have had difficulty managing on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, if not even extortion.
A child should never have to grow up in an environment that does not provide them with nourishment, care, and education, but this is what happens to them.
We believe that foster care represents a safe environment for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education, and reliable health care.
It is assumed that foster care meets all the needs that are not met in the home from which the child was taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic elements of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the theory of uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord’s (1998) study of audience reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely “personal involvement” and “continuous relationships”.
The use of video recording has allowed for significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is argued that it is possible to discover if a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks explained how people who are unable to understand spoken language due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even argues that these abilities in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research has demonstrated the existence of two pools of genetic variability, namely hidden variability and expressed variability.
With mutation, a new genetic variability is added, and with selection, it is eliminated from the pool of expressed variabilities.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute the variability back and forth between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to meet their amino acid requirements with the plant resources available in the savannah.
Moreover, the failure to carry out these activities has serious consequences: slowed growth, malnutrition, and, ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us they are difficult to digest unless they are cooked.
Animal foods, on the other hand (such as ants, termites, and eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide a high quantity of proteins, containing all the essential amino acids.
In light of all this, it should come as no surprise that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a sense much like savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the intentional process of waking up during the normal sleep period, followed by a resumption of sleep (10–60 minutes later).
This process can be easily put into practice by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you into a state of consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you decide to reset the clock while you sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options focused on the biorhythm involve consuming large amounts of liquids before bed (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which forces one to get up to urinate.
A person enjoys inner peace in proportion to the tension existing in their body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force is; each one of us has the potential ability to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment; this goal is only hindered by our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of love of the Mahayana ritual and by various techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple: it is based on Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and a path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini Yoga activates the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) through the use of yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the core of Tibetan meditation: by visualizing various deities, one cleanses the energy channels, activates the chakras, and develops the consciousness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, leading to collaboration between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, conflicts over systemic, procedural, and cultural issues caused a rift between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would have lasted for the next 40 years and would have been fought for real, by mercenary armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and in many other countries.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been breached; the only option was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans, however, proved to be obsolete almost immediately, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army advanced and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga peace treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral treaties.
Taking advantage of ships for the transport of goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the navy has always been to ensure that the country can safeguard its ability to transport people and goods, while at the same time countering the ability of enemies to move their own people and goods.
One of the recent examples supporting this theory and most worthy of note is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II, during which the Americans tried to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to support Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily using submarines, attempted to disrupt this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have had the chance to conquer Great Britain, just as it had done in the rest of Europe.
Apparently, goats were domesticated for the first time around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains, Iran.
They were raised by ancient cultures and tribes in order to have milk, wool, meat, and skin readily available.
Domestic goats were usually raised in herds that were allowed to roam freely on hills or other grazing areas, often tended by caprai (similar to shepherds) who were often children or adolescents. These methods of sheep herding are still used today.
As early as the 16th century, wagonways were built in England.
Despite being made simply of parallel wooden planks, the wagonway, when compared to the slightly more bumpy roads of the time, allowed horses travelling on it to reach higher speeds and transport heavier loads.
The sleepers were introduced relatively early to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
It became a common practice, although the iron caused greater wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones, and in 1767 the first completely iron rails made their appearance.
The first means of transportation that humans have known are their legs. Humans started walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means "upright man").
Its predecessor, the australopithecine, did not habitually walk upright.
Signs of specialization for bipedal locomotion are present in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
In order to try and mitigate future suffering to some extent, we can start adopting lifestyles that are more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmentalist movement, and we can also engage in activism.
In many cases, this only serves as a symptomatic treatment. If we do not want a temporary solution, however, we should find the ultimate cause of the problems and eliminate it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity, while problems have increased due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
After Congress adopted it on July 4, a manuscript draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap just a few blocks away.
In the night, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, known today as the "Dunlap broadsides."
The document was read publicly for the first time on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall, and the task was entrusted to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops stationed in New York on July 9, while a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 known drafts of Dunlap's letter are the oldest existing copies of the document; the original manuscript has been lost.
According to many paleontologists today, one category of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today: the ones we call birds.
Many tend not to consider them dinosaurs because of their feathers and their ability to fly.
And yet birds share many characteristics with dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs.
Ultimately, the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers is the foundation of all computers in use today.
A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and in the technical language of computer science, these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and its symptoms, including vomiting, are very general, making it impossible to make an immediate diagnosis.
The main indication of internal poisoning could be the presence in the home of an open container of medication or of hazardous chemicals.
Check the label to see if there are any first aid instructions related to that specific poison.
The term mite is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the familiarity with bed bugs in ancient times, insects that have adapted strongly to become parasites of humans.
Both bed bugs and assassin bugs are nesting insects, meaning they are adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States of America, multiple sclerosis (MS) affects around 400,000 people, making it the most common neurological disease affecting young people and adults of middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The research has highlighted that the likelihood of developing MS is twice as high in females compared to males.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child.
These couples have the option to choose an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the child's birth parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which in fact guides most scientific inquiry.
But it’s not just about experimentation, since an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also helps to guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Latin version of the Bible.
The opinions of Aristotle on the various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the gradual decline of the Greek language, the West was isolated from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior are determined by the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been documented, which are not just reactions to external periodic signals, in relation to a large part of living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, that is, viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments highlighting the bacteriophage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a range of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material involved, and whether the cells affected belong to the germ line.
The mutations that can be passed on to children are only those in germ cells; mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and wildlife.
Examples of activities that can be done on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visits to parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
For example, by visiting, photographing and getting to know the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small rural towns in their cars to go to work, crossing paths with others whose workplace is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic back-and-forth, everyone is somehow connected to and supporting a transportation system based on private cars.
Today, science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere outside of one of its conditions of stability that allowed human evolution over the past two million years.
Every person participates in social life and uses the transportation systems, which almost everyone complains about.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about the quality of water or crumbling bridges.
Why do transportation systems attract so many complaints, why are they failing every day? Is it because the engineers who design them are incompetent, or are there deeper motivations at play?
"Traffic Flow" is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another, and of the interactions they generate with one another.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is complex because drivers’ behavior cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, driver behavior tends to fall within a reasonably constant range, so traffic flows themselves tend to show a reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically in a generic way.
In order to obtain a more accurate representation of the traffic flow, the three main variables were correlated: (1) flow rate, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for planning, designing and managing road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take flight; the ability to fly allowed them to more easily evade enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
Many insects benefit from the ability to fold their wings along their bodies.
This allows them to exploit a greater variety of small crevices to hide from predators.
Among all the existing insects today, the only ones that are not able to fold their wings are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the Sun.
Some were right, but many others believed the opposite, that is, that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and also the other stars), moved around the Earth.
Which seems reasonable, because we don’t feel that the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the largest and second-longest river in the world, carrying a volume of water that is 8 times greater than that of the second-largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river in the world, with a width that reaches six miles in some places.
A total of 20% of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long, and it receives the waters of thousands of smaller tributaries.
Stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of size and technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were still enchanted by the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City consists of approximately 800 inhabitants, making it the smallest independent state in the world and the one with the smallest population.
The language of the Vatican City for legislation and official communications is Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most people working within the state, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
In Vatican City, all citizens are Roman Catholics.
The man started to get to know basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper in ancient times: these elements can be found in nature in their native form and can be extracted quite easily with the help of primitive tools.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is composed of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
These do indeed resemble the four states of matter, namely (in order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma. However, he also theorized that they transform into new substances, forming what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains numerous elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There can also be alloys composed of small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter, and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly small, so many trillions of them could fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
After its invention, the pencil has proven to be a good friend for many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and less widespread use.
Today, everyone types messages on computer screens and never needs to approach a thermometer.
We can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer arrives.
The principle that energy is required to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is the basis of how a fission bomb works.
In practice, it's like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. So, by further dividing the nucleus, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break apart in the presence of little or no force.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust, and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of approximately 70 km on the nearest side and 100 km on the farthest side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under mountainous areas.
The maria may be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner, which has facilitated the upwelling of lava at the surface.
Theories about content focus on finding what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they grow up.
These theories analyze what unites certain people and drives them to want to do what they do, and what are the factors of the context in which they live that push them to do or not do certain things.
Among the most popular theories on content, there are Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg’s Two-Factor Theory.
In general, when managers start to manage their former colleagues, two behaviors can emerge. On the one hand, there are those who try to remain "one of the guys" (or the girls).
The manager of this type finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, define and assign responsibilities.
At the opposite extreme, the manager transforms into a completely different person, feeling that they must change the entire operation of the team and make it their own.
In the end, the leader is the person who is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often creates disagreements between leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence for virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with a few small differences.
Members of the virtual team often serve as a point of contact for their next physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, since meetings can take place according to different time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The existence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
The management team, to which each member refers, is referred to as the "invisible team" and it is the team that establishes the standards for each member.
Why should an organization want to go through the long process of building a learning organization? A good reason for implementing the concepts of organizational learning may be innovation.
When you can effectively utilize all available resources across all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the path of collaboration within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
For an organization to be considered innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates the theory of the continuum as a method employed to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
The neurobiological results have demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition; the field of research becomes more narrow and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is the focus of research by scientists.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors can affect behavior and modify certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and brain processes that have never been observed before.
This gives us a wealth of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Despite having a strong science fiction connotation, AI represents a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research into AI includes the creation of machines to automate operations that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of applications include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer queries, as well as recognition of handwriting, voice and facial features.
These things have become distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-world problems.
Today, AI systems are often used in the economic, medical, engineering, and military fields, and are also integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are a fundamental part of education, and teachers often want to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution is offered by technology with virtual tours. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great opportunity to share travel experiences and reflections with future classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennet School, North Carolina, design a website about their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogs can also help improve students’ writing skills. Often, their first experiences with blogging are characterized by poor grammar and spelling, but typically the presence of an audience changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, in order to avoid negative judgments, the blog author commits to improving their writing.
Blogs also "force students to become more aware of the world around them." The need to engage the public motivates students to be inventive and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop students’ learning well beyond the normal school day.
The proper use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their own position within the writings of others, as well as delineate their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming and bilingual capital of Canada, rich in art galleries and museums that tell the story of the country’s past and present.
Further south you can find the Niagara Falls and to the north you can admire the natural beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All of this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian, according to foreigners’ opinions.
The wider areas further north are sparsely populated, some of which are almost uninhabited wildernesses.
If you compare the population, the result may come as a surprise to many: in the United States, the number of African American citizens is higher than the number of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a continent in its own right.
Almost all of the smaller islands, known for their luxurious beach resorts, are mostly independent nations or associated with France.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the islands, which then made its way to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape Route, which goes from Europe to India, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama paved the way for European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, while to the south and west it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean.
For female travelers: it is recommended that all women declare themselves to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
It is appropriate for women to realize that cultural differences can lead to what they themselves consider harassment, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Have the strength to refuse men, and don't be afraid to stand up to them (cultural differences or not, there is no excuse!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; under the name of Anfa, it was a port of strategic importance used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinides.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city, which was called Daru l-Badya, and later renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who chose this location for their trading posts.
Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a plethora of trinkets, but all of this is reserved solely for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying much of the city's streets, especially those in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is advisable to do thorough research before making any visits outside of Goma, in order to assess the state of the ongoing clashes in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as one of the less expensive opportunities for seeing the mountain gorillas of Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around in Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Also as a result of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" ended up becoming a metaphor for an exotic and distant land.
Today, Timbuktu is a decaying city, but due to its reputation it remains a tourist attraction, complete with an airport.
In 1990 it was included in the list of UNESCO heritage sites that are in danger, due to the threat posed by the desert sands.
The special by Henry Louis Gates on PBS "Wonders of the African World" was one of the main stops.
With its more Arabic than African influence, the city stands out distinctly from the others in the country.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and stretches east along the border with Mozambique, to the north it borders Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
With a surface area of 19,500 km², the park comprises 14 different ecozones, each of which provides sustenance to a different wildlife population.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the most important of the South African national parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily conservation fees and entry fees to the park.
Purchasing a Wild Card may also be useful, as it allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island, which gives its name to the entire territory, is the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a glittering bar graph, made all the more striking by its setting against the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the waterfront of Kowloon across the way.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development has been concentrated on reclaimed land on the densely populated north coast.
This is the place that the English colonizers chose for themselves, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this land, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast inland in Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest located within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, forests are not only made up of mangrove swamps: they also contain what remains of the impressive jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about a third consists of marshy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for wildlife; it is estimated that there are 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the interdistrict bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang) depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
As buses that serve different districts are often full, it is a good idea to buy your ticket a few days in advance.
Most neighborhoods are served by comfortable and sturdy Japanese minibuses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby locations, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a suspension bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
Its two pylons are 83 metres tall, it is 378 metres long, and has two lanes that are 3.50 metres wide.
The space under the bridge is 15 metres high. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
In September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge should be fully operational.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in present-day eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and the Payaguá, who lived off hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The Great Province of the Indies", was founded in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous native groups.
The Spanish ushered in a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its identity and its native characteristics.
Everyone knows that Argentina boasts one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the most important tournament of the year takes place in the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Here you can watch minor tournaments and matches at other times of the year as well.
For information on tournaments and purchasing tickets for polo matches, contact the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The Falkland Islands have their own official currency, the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the value of which is equivalent to that of the British pound (GBP).
The only bank on the islands, located in Stanley in front of the FIC West store, offers currency exchange services.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley it is often possible to pay with credit cards and US dollars.
It is likely that in the outlying islands credit cards will not be accepted, although British and US currencies may be accepted. Check with the owners in advance to decide on an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so change your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical region; temperatures above 30°C are quite normal during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the feeling of a temperature lower than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no defined "dry" and "rainy" seasons: the amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year.
Even if many of the animals in the park are used to human presence, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park authorities recommend keeping a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals.
No matter how docile they may seem: bison, moose, deer, bears, practically all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they fail to maintain an appropriate distance; these animals need to be given adequate space, as they are large, wild, and potentially dangerous.
Also, keep in mind that odors can attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking foods with very strong smells, and try to keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoa Islands. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This port was the site of the infamous naval standoff of 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk, with the exception of a British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme chief.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is located between two harbors. The most popular ones are divided into three areas.
The beaches facing the Pacific Ocean on the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are mainly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook Waitemata Harbour.
These are family-friendly beaches that can get crowded at times, surrounded by a wide variety of shops, and swimming is safe.
The most well-known local beer is a simple, refreshing and pleasant beer called "Number One". The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can get many French wines, but Australian and New Zealand wines might fare better on the journey.
The tap water in the area is totally safe to drink, but if you are worried, bottled water is easy to find.
According to the Australians, the 'flat white' coffee was born from a foreign idea. An 'espresso' is a short black coffee, a cappuccino is covered in cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is on par with that of Belgium. Fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Throughout the year, many excursions to the coral reef are organized and accidents due to these reasons on the coral reef are rare.
Always seek advice from the authorities, follow their instructions, and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Cubomedusae appear from October to April near the beaches and river estuaries north of Seventeen Seventy; outside of this period they can only be found occasionally.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack humans; most sharks fear humans and tend to keep their distance.
The habitat of saltwater crocodiles consists mainly of the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton, as they do not actively live in the ocean.
By booking in advance, the traveler can rest assured of finding a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with certain hotels, but it is still possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages that include breakfast, transfers to and from the airport, or even combined flight+hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain additional documents required for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any changes or requests must be made beforehand to the travel agent, and not directly to the hotel.
On the occasion of some music festivals, most of the attendees decide to camp on site, considering this aspect a crucial element of the experience.
To be close to the center of the action, you need to arrive early and secure a spot near the music.

They usually offer exclusive food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in high spirits and make them want to stay.
In some establishments, alcoholic beverages are offered free of charge by the house. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and every good gambler knows how important it is to remain sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice or temperatures close to zero.
On icy and snow-covered carriageways, friction is reduced and it is not possible to drive as well as on clean asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in such a short time that you can get stuck.
Even precipitation and gusts of snow, or the formation of ice or condensation on the vehicle windows, can reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the centerpiece of many visitors' vacations.
In its popular usage, the term safari refers to trips taken over land, particularly in the savannah, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to come closer to cars, so normal equipment is sufficient to get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, which is why it is possible to observe them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk", "safari excursion", or "walking safari") is an excursion that can last a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2012, and some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.

If your booking for flights and accommodation for 2020 was made before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, however, most of the cancellation policies related to the coronavirus, as of the end of March 2020, do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
It is expected that the cost of most event tickets will be between 2,500 ¥ and 130,000 ¥, while regular tickets will cost around 7,000 ¥.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry faster. Many hotels offer the use of an iron and ironing board, even if they are not present in the room.
If you don’t have an iron, or you don’t like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if you have one available.
Be careful not to expose the fabrics to excessively high temperatures, to avoid shrinkage or, in the worst case scenario, burning.
There are various ways to sanitize water, and some of them are more effective against specific risks.
In some areas it is sufficient to boil the water for a minute, while in others it takes many minutes.
The effectiveness of filters can vary, so in case of doubt it is advisable to consider purchasing water that is packaged in sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travellers may come into contact with animal parasites that are not found in their home regions.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case scenario, trigger allergic reactions, as well as transmit poison or infections.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with force are not usually classified as harmful animals.
Duty Free shopping is an opportunity to buy tax-free and duty-free products in certain locations.
Travellers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway between Point Marion and Fairmont is the one with the most difficult driving conditions, as it often crosses isolated areas surrounded by vegetation.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, it is advisable to keep a close eye out, as steep inclines, narrow roads and tight bends are common.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than those applied in the previous and subsequent sections (usually 35-40 mph/56-64 km/h). Their strict observance is extremely important.
Strangely, however, the level of mobile phone coverage in this area is much higher than in other parts of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German desserts are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite tasty and varied, similar to those of nearby Austria to the south.
Fruit desserts are a timeless classic, from those with apples available all year round to those with cherries and plums, which make an appearance during the summer.
Several German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. The most popular cakes often pair very well with a cup of strong coffee.
Those who want to taste small pastries that are big on flavour can opt for those that, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid it contains.

Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term generally refers to foods originating from the central and eastern regions of the main island, Java.
The cuisine of Java, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a series of dishes that are easy to prepare; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Indonesian coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet and are located on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but may present safety issues due to the possibility that the rider's feet may become trapped.
If a jockey is thrown off a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged along by the fleeing horse. To minimize this risk, there are some safety measures that can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a rather thin sole.
Later, some saddles, especially those made in England, included safety bars that cause a leather strap to detach from the saddle when, in the event of a fall, the rider pulls it backwards.
Cochamó Valley: the most important climbing destination in Chile, known as South America’s Yosemite, where there are a large number of enormous granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks of the summits offer breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world are constantly tracing new routes up its potentially infinite walls.
Downhill snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular and involve sliding down the snow using skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and has many enthusiasts, sometimes referred to as "ski bums", who dedicate entire holiday periods to skiing in a particular area.
The principle behind skiing is very old: the first cave paintings depicting humans skiing date back to 5000 B.C.!
Alpine skiing as a sport has its origins at least as far back as the 17th century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia by Norwegians.
Ski hiking: this activity is also known as off-piste skiing, ski mountaineering or ski trekking.
She is connected to, even if she doesn’t usually participate in them, touring skiing and skimo, which are practiced on steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski run as a path similar to a hiking trail.
If conditions are good, you can cover somewhat greater distances than when walking, but you will only rarely reach cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack on well-trodden trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but made up of many independent countries. Normally, to travel through multiple countries you would need to apply for a visa and go through passport control multiple times.
However, in this regard, the Schengen area functions more like a single country.
If you stay within this area, you can normally go from one border to the other without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for separate visas for each member country, thus saving time, money and hassle.
There is no universal definition of what makes an item an antique. Some tax agencies consider an item to be an antique if it is at least 100 years old.
The definition presents geographical differences compared to the age limit, which may be lower, as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
Craft objects could be defined as pieces of antique furniture, even if they are more recent than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer husbandry is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture underlying this trade is also the foundation of many other professions.
Even over time, not all Sámi have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding; some lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer primarily as work animals.
Today, many Sámi people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the territory of the Sámi people.
Even though it is widely used, particularly among non-Rom people, the word "zingaro" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a misperception of the Roma people.

You may also be interested in the opinions of governments other than your own, but keep in mind that these opinions are aimed at the citizens of those governments.
To give an example, American citizens in the Middle East may encounter different situations compared to Europeans or Arabs.
The alerts simply constitute a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions reported are often superficial, general and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Adverse weather conditions" is the general term used to describe any dangerous meteorological phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of them depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, above-average precipitation, and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similarly to thunderstorms, tornadoes, sea tornadoes, and cyclones.
Among the regional and seasonal weather phenomena of high intensity are thunderstorms, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travellers are advised to check the weather conditions in their area, as they may affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could potentially be considered a war zone must undergo professional training.
By searching the Internet for 'Hostile environment course', you are likely to find the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A standard course typically lasts between 2 and 5 days and includes role-playing games, as well as many training activities on first aid and sometimes on weapons.
Books and magazines about survival in the wilderness are abundant, while publications about war zones are few and far between.
Travellers who plan to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have valid travel documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without gender designations (X) or to update documents to match a desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents is equally variable.
Even inspections of security checks have become much more thorough in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
People who are pre-operative transgender should not expect to pass through security checks without their privacy and dignity being violated.
Rip currents are formed by the return flow of waves breaking on the beach, often near a coral reef or similar formation.
Given the submarine topography, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current towards the open sea can form.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion while attempting to swim against the current, which can prove impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back will no longer be more difficult than usual.
Try to find a location where you are not at risk of being trapped again, or consider whether to wait for rescue, based on your skills and whether you have been spotted.
Re-entry shock manifests itself in a shorter period of time than cultural shock (since there is a shorter "honeymoon" phase), lasts longer, and can be more serious.
Travelers who have found it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes have difficulty readjusting to their home country's culture.
When returning home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the customs of your original culture.
In your first experience abroad, you are likely to have encountered patient and understanding people, aware that travelers in a new country need time to adjust.
Many people did not imagine that patience and awareness were also necessary for those returning home.
The spectacle of sounds and lights at the pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions in the area for children.
Before the start of the show, it will be possible to admire the pyramids bathed in darkness and silence.
Normally, you can always hear the noise caused by tourists and vendors; the spectacle of sounds and lights is just like a collection of short stories.
The Sphinx becomes the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids, and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by various countries, the southern Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the highest number of bases, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest island and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among the other islands are Livingston Island and Deception Island; in the latter, the caldera of an active volcano filled with water has given rise to a magnificent natural harbor.
The Ellsworth Land is the region located to the south of the peninsula and overlooks the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, before re-emerging to form the Ellsworth Mountains, a chain of 360 km divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Range, boasts the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches a height of 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas with no cellular coverage, a satellite phone may be the only possible alternative.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outside with an unobstructed view of the satellite in order to make a call.
The service is often used by pleasure boats, including those used for recreational purposes, as well as by missions that require remote data and voice communication.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
One of the options that is increasingly popular among those who plan to take a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly popular among recent graduates, as they can take a year off before starting university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad during the sabbatical year can actually increase the chances of returning to higher education back in one’s home country.
Usually, enrollment in these educational programs requires payment of a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love boating: in the "Land of a Thousand Lakes", there are also thousands of islands, both within the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don’t necessarily need a yacht for the archipelagos and lakes.
Even if the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime of Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This also happens in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but it is generally a rather singular phenomenon (for example, in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Most of the different Baltic cruises include a multi-day stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that it is possible to visit the historic town for two full days, returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.
A separate visa will not be required for disembarkation (as of 2009) using the onboard excursions.
Some brochures also offer cruises to Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea, and visiting the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be scary for people of all ages and conditions, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not dissimilar to the fears and personal aversions that many people manifest towards other things.
For some people, understanding a bit about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can be helpful in overcoming a fear based on the unknown or a lack of control.
Courier services are well paid to deliver products quickly, and often timing is very important in the case of business documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
For some routes, the larger companies use their own planes, but for other routes and in the case of smaller companies, problems emerged.
On some routes, shipments by air would have taken days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to get it there faster would be to ship it as checked luggage, and that’s where you come in, since airline regulations don’t allow for shipping luggage without a passenger.
To fly first or business class, the most obvious way is to pay a pretty penny for the privilege (or, even better, convince your company to do so).
However, the price to pay is high: you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for Business travel, and up to eleven times the fare for first class travel!
In general, on direct flights from A to B, it’s not even worth looking for discounts on first-class or business-class seats.
Airlines know there is a category of travelers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably at their destination, and they accordingly apply certain rates.
The capital of Moldavia is Chişinău and the local language is Romanian, however Russian is also very common.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has in the past been the site of an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two regions of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is Christian Orthodoxy.
Izmir is Turkey’s third largest city, with a population of around 3.7 million; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important transport hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna is developed on a huge bay, is surrounded by mountains and currently constitutes a modern, evolved and active commercial center.
Although the city has a more Mediterranean European feel than traditional Turkey, wide avenues, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centres are dotted with the distinctive red-tiled roofs, a 18th-century market and ancient mosques and churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and you can visit a unique octagonal church.
In the churchyard, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
Half an hour is enough to walk around the charming village.
To the north lies the romantic and charming town of Sintra, which is easily accessible and became famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to the brilliant account of its splendours written by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb line bus 403 regularly connects with Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north, visit the great sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (a place of worship), a site of Marian apparitions famous throughout the world.
Remember that the site you are visiting is essentially a mass grave, and it has an almost incalculable significance to a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived these places, and many others who saw their loved ones murdered or forced to work until death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Avoid jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Avoid defacing these places by marking the structures with signs or graffiti.
In the city of Barcelona, the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, while the vast majority is able to understand it; Spanish is known by practically everyone.
However, most of the signs are written exclusively in Catalan, which is the official first language by law.
Spanish, however, is also widely used for public transportation and other services.
On the metro, regular announcements are only in Catalan. Any unscheduled service interruptions are communicated in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese, thanks to an automatic system.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Even if it is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to feel at ease in Paris is still to behave in the best possible way, acting like a “bien élevé” (well-mannered) person. This will definitely make your travels easier.
The rough exterior of Parisians will quickly disappear if you display some basic good manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is rich in forests, mainly composed of beech, pine, and fir trees, and is characterized by a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a variety of microclimates, different types of soil, and different altitudes, it presents a wide variety of plant communities.
The area is also home to a huge variety of animal and bird species.
Rare species such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat, and capercaillie live in these places, alongside many other more commonly found animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and to cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide stoles for women who arrive unprepared, but if you already have one, especially if it is brightly colored, you will earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long pants down to their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the storage area at the entrance; however, the garments are not washed after each user, so wearing these skirts may not be comfortable for you. For men, a single size for everyone!
The cuisine of Majorca, like that of similar regions in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil everywhere.
Pa amb Oli is a simple, popular summer dish: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any other condiments available, such as cheese or tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the pronoun "Sie" used for the polite form of "du" (you), always begin with a capital letter, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This represents an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
This aspect probably also makes the text easier to read, although the need to understand whether a verb or adjective is being used in a substantivised form makes the writing rather complex.
Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most words are pronounced the way they are spelled.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation changes depending on the vowel that follows them.
Also make sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: caro means dear, while carro means carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar manual could help you a lot with Persian grammar and understanding sentences.
It goes without saying that if you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with a basic knowledge of the Spanish language may come to the hasty conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore does not need to be studied separately.
Nowadays, pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete and serve as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution was not a problem during their heyday, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, which are more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous structures located in remote areas where the atmospheric conditions are favorable.
The practice of admiring the cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where the flowering of plum trees was preferred.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were organized by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy close to the imperial court.
Plants thrive when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even just one specimen.
If you visit an Italian garden, even picking up a few specimens of plants will cost you an immediate expulsion from the premises, without discussion.
In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy city to navigate; you can pretty much buy anything once you get there.
But being in the "high tropics," just a few degrees north of the equator, you'll have to contend with heat (always) and strong sun (more rarely, when the sky is clear).
Some buses also head north, towards Hebron, the traditional site where the Bible's patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives, were buried.
Make sure the bus you want to take goes inside Hebron and doesn't stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great theme around which to organize a holiday.
For example, you can visit castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, take a cruise to visit the interesting cities on the Danube, or navigate on the Erie Canal.
In addition, they define the routes of well-known hiking trails and bike paths.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
One tradition involves spending Easter night awake in an open-air location in order to witness the sunrise.
There are of course Christian theological explanations for the origins of this tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual linked to spring and fertility.
In more traditional churches, a Easter Vigil is often held on the Saturday night of the Easter weekend, with congregations often starting the ceremony at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands did so by swimming, flying or floating.
Since the distance from the mainland was considerable, mammals were unable to make the journey, which led to the giant tortoise becoming the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Numerous mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs, and cats were introduced to the Galapagos after the arrival of humans.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic territories during winter, you can experience the polar night, when the sun remains below the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the possibility of witnessing the Northern Lights, as the sky remains dark for almost the entire day.
Since the territories are sparsely populated, light pollution is often not a problem and you can enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners tend to be used to.
Office clothing usually consists of a jacket and tie or a suit, and colleagues are addressed by their last name or professional title.
The harmony of the workplace is of crucial importance, as it emphasizes the commitment of the group rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often need approval from their superiors for every decision, and are expected to follow instructions without question.
