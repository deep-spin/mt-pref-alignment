Siminoff appeared on the home shopping network QVC in late 2017.
Ring also reached a settlement with the competing security services company, ADT Corporation.
While there appears to be an experimental vaccine that can reduce mortality from Ebola, no drug has yet been found that has clearly proven itself in treating the existing infection.
An antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially looked promising in the field, but formal studies have shown it to be less effective than hoped in preventing deaths.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp was used as a control, meaning scientists used it as a reference and compared it to the other three therapies.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes the absolute necessity for the Olympic community to work together to create a safe environment for all its athletes.
We agree with the USOC that the best interests of our athletes and our clubs, and their sport, can be better served by driving meaningful change within our organization, rather than decertification.
USA Gymnastics has launched an independent investigation into how it is possible that abuse of the magnitude described so bravely by those who have survived Larry Nassar could have been hidden for so long, and is willing to implement any necessary or appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the same goal: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a reliable, positive and responsible environment.
In the 1960s, Brzezinski was an advisor to John F. Kennedy and later to the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.

Turkey, the statement says, would also take over the custody of ISIS fighters who are being held prisoner, and who, in the face of European nations' refusals, have not been repatriated.
This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely accepted, but provides more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was brownish-gray on top, with a pale or carotenoid coloration on the bottom.
The discovery also allows for detailed information to be obtained about the evolution of bird feathers.
Because the dinosaur's feathers lack the basic structure, the so-called rachis, but instead have other features typical of feathers, barbs and barbules, the researchers concluded that the rachis is likely the result of an evolutionary development subsequent to these features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or courtship. The researchers hypothesize that, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the find shows adult feathers and not those of a chick.
According to the researchers' hypotheses, despite the tail belonging to a young dinosaur, the sample reveals a plumage from an adult specimen and not that of a chick.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two officers and injuring more than twenty people.

They found that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all stars in the solar system is determined by nothing other than their luminosity and rotation.
Brightness is used in conjunction with rotation to define a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in response to magnetic reversals.

He also added that they should not, however, be forced to assume obligations that go beyond their stage of development, as well as their responsibilities and competencies.
The Iraq Study Group presented its report today at 12:00 GMT.
He cautioned: "No one can guarantee that any action in Iraq at this time will stop sectarian warfare, growing violence or a slide towards chaos."
The report begins with a call for open debate and consensus-building in the United States about policy toward the Middle East.
The report is highly critical of almost every aspect of the government's current policy towards Iraq and calls for an immediate change of direction.
The first of its 78 recommendations calls for a new diplomatic initiative to be launched by the end of this year aimed at protecting Iraq's borders from hostile action and resuming diplomatic relations with its neighbours.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the actual measurements of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team's hoped-for effect was to be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter in this galaxy and the dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a tidal force on Earth, causing the tides, the Milky Way exerts a tidal force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same effects that "normal" matter has.
This theory suggests that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is collected in a kind of halo, made up of a multitude of small particles.
Television reports show white smoke coming out of the plant.
Local authorities are warning people living near the plant to stay indoors, turn off air conditioning and not drink tap water.

Dr Tony Moll has identified extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province.
In a statement given in an interview, this new variant was "highly concerning and alarming, due to the high mortality rate".
Dr Moll said some patients may have picked up the bug in hospital, with at least two of them healthcare workers at the hospital.
In the course of a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
Still, the percentage of XDR-TB in the overall TB population appears to be low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any one time in South Africa.

Following the construction of the dam in 1963, seasonal floods that spread sediment along the river course have stopped.
This sediment was instrumental in creating both beaches and sandbanks that became habitats for wildlife.
As a result, two species of fish have become extinct and two more are at risk of extinction, including the humphead wrasse.
Even though the flood will only raise the water level by a few metres, the authorities hope that it will be enough to restore the eroded sandbanks further downstream.

Infrared images show thermal oscillations between day and night, proving that they are probably caves.
During the day they are colder than the surrounding surface, and at night they are warmer.
Glen Cushing of the USGS Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona, said: "Their thermal behavior is not as consistent as that of large terrestrial caves, which often maintain a relatively stable temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground."
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters enter an isolated booth and put a pre-printed ballot into an envelope indicating their chosen candidate.
After the officials verify their identity, the voter deposits the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral register.
The French electoral law codifies the procedures in a rather strict way.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that no envelopes are present at the start of the vote and that no others are added to those of the duly counted and authorised voters.
Candidates may send their representatives to attend each stage of the process. In the evening, the volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, in accordance with specific procedures.

The other race she competed in, the giant slalom, saw her finish tenth in the women's sitting category with a combined time of 4:41.30, more than 2:11.60 minutes behind the winner, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and more than 1:09.02 minutes behind ninth-placed Hungarian GyÃ¶ngyi Dani.
Four female skiers in the women's event failed to finish their runs, and 45 of the 117 starters in the giant slalom did not finish the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police managed to recover the laptop and the mobile phone that had been stolen.
Deputy Inspector General DK Arya announced: "Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman. We have also found her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
None of the three people who were in the house at the time of the car crash were injured.
Despite this, the driver was seriously injured to the head.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been at Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with killing her own son.
She is being held in custody pending trial and sentencing, but any testimony from an eyewitness could be tainted, as her image has been widely publicized.
It is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice has different parameters. Scottish courts have deemed the publication of the photos potentially prejudicial.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee, "journalists who publish photos or other material of suspects are walking on a minefield."
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecutions, said it would not be making any further comment until the formal charge was made.
The document is expected to focus on the dispute over borders, which Palestinians want to be based on the lines that existed before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other issues reportedly discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement was signed, Israel demanded a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agreed to abandon such presence only for five years.
Shooters on the experimental feral control program had to be closely supervised by rangers, as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of the Sporting Shooters Association hunting program, the NPWS, in partnership with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., has recruited qualified volunteers.
The four shooters chosen for the first firing operation have received comprehensive training and safety instructions, according to Mick O'Flynn, acting Park Conservation and Heritage Manager of the NPWS.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth provisional electoral council in four years.
Last month a presidential commission proposed a package of measures aimed at pushing the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests, beginning in October, that challenge the regime.
The occasionally violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which were scheduled as far back as 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of malfunctioning iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents involving the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of another 34 incidents related to overheating, which the company described as "not serious."
In its response, the ministry called Apple's delay of the report "absolutely deplorable."
The earthquake in the Mariana Islands was felt at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office, no damage was reported in the nation.
And the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that there were no signs of a tsunami in progress.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino policeman took hostage Hong Kong tourists after hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle, Rolando Mendoza fired on the tourists.
Many of the hostages were saved, at least six died.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were freed immediately along with the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an elderly lady who needed to use the toilet. Mendoza was struck dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
After training as an obstetrician, she joined the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began studying cases of premature labor in his free time.
His research showed that the administration of a hormone would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two "black boxes" with flight recordings.
Even his fellow wrestlers wanted to pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. She passed away on the night of the two moons. Unique, just like her. A strong woman."
"Luna was as weird as me... maybe even weirder... I loved her and I'm going to miss her... Hopefully she's in a better place," was Dustin "Goldust" Runnels' comment.
According to a poll of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 per cent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard said she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
This view is shared by 34% of survey respondents, who believe that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
At the other end of the poll, 29 per cent of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent believe it should never become one.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games but has suffered a number of ailments which have raised doubts about her fitness.
She couldn't take the painkillers she needed because they are banned from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at Central Missouri University, discovered the largest prime number known to date.
The discovery was verified by multiple people using various hardware and software in early February, and was announced Tuesday.
Comets could have been one of the sources that brought water and organic matter, the material that can form proteins and support life, to Earth.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form and in particular how the Earth formed, having collided with comets a long time ago.
Mr. Cuomo, 53, has been in office since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he signed a law that makes same-sex marriage legal.
According to him, speculation is nothing more than "political chatter and nonsense."
He is considering a candidacy for the presidency in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel annually, reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system employs satellite technology rather than the outdated ground-based radar-based system, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being arranged and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, while there are no car parks or park and ride facilities on site.
Fears over the lack of transport have raised the possibility of the game being played behind closed doors, without the support of the team's fans.
According to a study published on Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of bird has been born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers from Princeton University, USA, and Uppsala University, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that the time needed for this process was much longer; this as a result of mating between a Darwin's endemic finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrated cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into any shape. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled until it forms a thin wire, suitable for being twisted and interwoven. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts" precisely because it could be made so thin.
This is the so-called pH of the substance. Using red cabbage juice, it is possible to build a pH indicator.
The juice of the cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
The pH level of the chemical being tested is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the H in pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with clean, wet hands, roll them into a ball.
Between the moisture on your hands and the outer layers, a reaction will occur that will cause a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
Almost all the houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with running water connected to an advanced sewage system.
In Greece, the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini have revealed the remains of sewage systems.
Toilets in ancient times also existed in Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization they were sometimes included in public baths, frequented by a mixed public of men and women.
To call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts the light and the view.
A rocket more than 100 feet tall is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world enormously. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important one is that it has provided us with simpler and faster transport.
Thanks to his invention, the train, the automobile and several other means of transportation appeared.
Below them are other medium-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including feral domestic cats) that feed on vastly more numerous prey items, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The concept of niche is the secret of their success, a particular goal that each feline has and that allows them not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats and live in large groups called prides.
The herds are composed of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and cubs that can reach 30.
Usually the females are closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The lion pride behaves much like a wolf or dog pack, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not of other big cats), including in their deadly attacks on prey.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (albeit not very well), swim, jump very long distances and exert a pulling force five times greater than that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the genus Panthera) as the lion, the leopard and the jaguar. These four felines are the only ones that roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as that of the lion, but it more resembles a sentence of shouted and angry words.
Ocelots love to feed on small animals. If possible, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds, and almost all the prey they catch is much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find their prey by smell, sniffing out where they have been on the ground.
Thanks to their night vision, they are able to see very well in the dark, and are also able to move stealthily. To hunt their prey, ocelots blend in with their surroundings before pouncing on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population it belongs to (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or a river, or moves to a new island, making it difficult to return), it will likely find itself in a different environment than it was in before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, so in order to position itself as a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations than those required previously.
The indigenous population has not changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
As time goes on and the new population adapts to its new environment, it looks less and less like the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which involves the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide exhaled by humans (through breathing out).
Plants process their own nourishment with the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes from plants and we make our clothes from plants. Much of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its era and so it feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were lined with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an additional row on the palate, so that anyone who crossed its path was doomed.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that it had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have been a cannibal.
He would attack anything that went into the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex would not have been able to compete with him.
While many of their foods would be familiar to us, Roman banquets also featured several strange or unusual dishes, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a gopher.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, the wealthy men liked to feast together while lying on their sides while consuming their meal.
Of course, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no maize, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each deity, which was considered the dwelling place of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to provide for the needs of the deities through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built and became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
Thanks to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, the house was not of fundamental importance.
Much of the Jewish family's life took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard, while shops were simple open-air stalls that faced the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no great forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas it is said that it was Erik the Red who gave it its name, having encountered Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But, regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although all were "Scandinavian" countries, the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland were very different.
If you saw the movie "The Da Vinci Code," you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence is a treasure map.
However, this is false. Even if something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence has the words "Original Declaration of Independence July 4, 1776" written on it, and the text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence the large parchment document (measuring 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Therefore, the annotation was probably just a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing fighting had brought northern France to liberation, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the Vichy regime, that is, by those French who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and had allied themselves with the invaders, instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France: this offensive operation was called "Operation Dragoon".
American and Free French forces had liberated southern France in just two weeks and were heading towards Germany.
Civilization refers to a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, forming a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis", which means civil; the term is in turn connected with "civis", that is citizen, and "civitas", that is city or city-state, and in a certain way it also defines the dimensions of society.
City-states are the first to anticipate the idea of nation. Culture of civilization means to transmit knowledge through multiple generations, to leave an indelible cultural imprint through fair distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving any significant historical traces, and are thus not recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states formed a weak central government for the first time, and the Congress was its only member, according to the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to enforce taxes, and with no executive or judicial power at the national level, it relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce its acts.
He didn't even have the authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
To change the articles required the unanimous consent of all states, and these states had so little regard for the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German team, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
The most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are more widespread in the northern regions and see Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of almost 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
Geographically, Japan is referred to as an "archipelago" due to the presence of groups of islands that make up the country.
Taiwan was born in the 15th century, when European sailors who passed by soon recorded the name of the island with the name of Ilha Formosa, or wonderful island.
The Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan in 1624, initiating a transformation of the aborigines' grain production systems and bringing in Chinese labourers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan came under the control of the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, thereby ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan; the island remained under Japanese rule until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Much of the peripheral buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30% of the Machu Picchu site had been recovered, but restoration work is still ongoing.
The most common format in the world for still photography, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the most commonly used film at the end of the era of analog photography.
It is still produced today and, more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Oddly enough, the height of the 35 mm format is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest ratio of whole numbers) are therefore considered to be 3:2.
The aspect ratios of many common formats (for example, the APS format family) are equal to or very close to this value.
The oft-abused and often-ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while still maintaining a sense of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point to place the main subject corresponds to the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
At this stage in European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, found itself under scrutiny.
Christian religion had acted as a glue between European states for more than a thousand years, despite linguistic and cultural differences.
Its ubiquitous power has influenced everyone from the king to the common citizen.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary reserves exist precisely for this reason.
The church's central authority remained in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this convergence of power and money has led many to question whether this principle was ever respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective: it involved the interruption of any essential military and civilian supply, despite this blockade violating international law, which is usually accepted and codified by multiple international treaties of the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any vessel from accessing whole sections of the ocean, putting even neutral ships at risk.
As this tactic had elicited a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its indiscriminate U-boat warfare campaign.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer at the Edison Company in New York City, which led him to move to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his boss at his previous job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, the different periods of time were indicated in a very unique way: each period of China or each family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
The intervals between the individual dynasties were also characterized by periods of instability and division between the provinces. The most famous was the so-called period of the Three Kingdoms, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
During these periods, fierce wars broke out between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in battles to secure a place of honor in the imposing palace in Xi'an.
The social and political effects are numerous, among these we can mention the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to the republic, nationalism and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and is not the property of a single sovereign.
Moreover, after the Revolution, professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same goes for the military, as army rankings, instead of being based on class, are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also an inspiration for many other oppressed workers of various countries to start their own revolution.
But Mohammed was deeply interested in matters beyond the life of this world. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, offers a very clear picture of the spirituality of Mohammed.
The cave sits atop one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely cut off from the rest of the world.
It is not easy to find, even if you know it exists, and once inside the cave, isolation is total.
You can see nothing but a beautiful clear sky and a lot of mountains around. From the inside of the cave you can see or hear very little of the surrounding world.
Of the Seven Wonders of the World, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one that has survived to the present day without being in ruins.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramid structures built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, is home to numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), various smaller tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the pharaoh's wives and family members.
The "up arc" looks like a V and the "down arc" looks like a staple or a square with a missing bottom.
Up means you should start from the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start from the alamaro (which is where the hand supports the bow) and pull the bow towards you.
An up bow usually produces a softer sound, while a down bow produces a stronger, more decisive sound.
You can decide to add your own custom markings to the pencil, but keep in mind that the arching marks you find printed have a musical value, so they should be respected in general.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of market women forced King Louis XVI, in a state of terror, to leave Versailles and return to Paris, along with Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie ThÃ©rÃ¨se and 4-year-old Louis Charles) and the king's sister, Elizabeth.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and screaming threats at the royals.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep their carriage windows open.
At one point someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The war expenses of US imperialism to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover much of the expenses and the interest on the bonds fluctuated in the name of the Philippine government through the banking institutions of Wall Street.
Clearly, the huge profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people formed the profits at the base of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history covering the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (from 1000 to 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or technological imperative to the narrow sense according to which the fate of man is moved by an underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Many interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: one is that the development of technology itself follows a course that is far beyond the influence of politics and culture, and the other is that technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the automobile necessarily involves the development of the road network.
However, a national road network for just a few cars is not economically sustainable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs associated with car ownership.
Mass ownership of automobiles also leads to a higher percentage of accidents on the roads, and as a result, the invention of new rescue techniques for the care of injured people.
Romanticism was characterized by a strong component of cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography conditioned individuals, and over time, usages, customs and culture linked to this geography arose which, being in harmony with the context of society, proved more effective than laws imposed arbitrarily.
Similarly to Paris, known today as the capital of contemporary fashion, Constantinople was the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a hub of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until around 1100 AD.
During the 12th century its prestige declined, mainly because the crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of the Gothic style was reached in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the east.
But the slowness of communication channels means that the spread of styles in the West can be delayed by 25-30 years.
By the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the era, resulting from the Crusades, was the introduction of buttons for fastening clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is defined as agriculture practised solely for the purpose of producing sufficient food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, usually organic, using seed stocks native to the ecological region in association with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at getting the most out of the harvest.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and in many developing countries, it still is.
Subcultures unite individuals with the same opinions who do not feel represented by society's standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, manners, and slang.
One of the most commonly used methods of explaining the importance of socialization is to analyze some unfortunate cases of children who, as a result of neglect, misfortune, or the effect of intentional abuse, grew up without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "feral" or wild. Some of them have been segregated by people (often their own parents): in some cases, abandonment is motivated by the refusal of a serious intellectual or physical handicap by the parents.
Feral children may have suffered serious violence or trauma before abandonment or flight.
Other children may have been raised by animals; still others seem to have lived alone in the wild.
When the feral child is fully raised by non-human animals, it shows behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely analogous to those of the particular animal that took care of it, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Project-based learning should make learning itself easier and more interesting, while scaffolding goes a bit further.
Scaffolding is not a mode of learning, but rather a help for those who undertake a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "scaffolding," but so is the little paperclip helper in Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are designed to query, prompt and explain the procedures that the student may have found difficult to manage on their own.
Children are put up for adoption for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, if not even extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that does not guarantee them nourishment, care and education, but they do.
We believe that fostering is a safe place for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education, and reliable health care.
It is assumed that foster care meets all the needs not met in the home from which the child was removed.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the theory of uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord's (1998) study of audience reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal involvement" and "continuous relationships."
The use of video recording has allowed for significant discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is argued that it is possible to find out if a person is lying by interpreting micro-expressions correctly.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks illustrated how people unable to understand spoken language due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even argues that such abilities in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century research has shown the existence of two pools of genetic variability, namely hidden variability and expressed variability.
With mutation, new genetic variability is added; with selection, it is eliminated from the pool of expressed variability.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute the variability back and forth between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive system similar to humans, it is difficult to meet amino acid requirements with the plant resources available in the savannah.
Moreover, the failure to carry out these activities has serious consequences: slowed growth, malnutrition and, eventually, even death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us they are difficult to digest, unless cooked.
Animal foods, on the other hand (such as ants, termites, and eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
In light of all this, it should come as no surprise that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a sense much like savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the intentional process of waking during the normal sleep period, followed by resumption of sleep (10â€“60 minutes later).
This process can be easily practiced using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you into a state of consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you decide to reset the clock while you sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biological rhythm-focused options include drinking a lot of fluids before bed (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which forces you to get up to urinate.
A person enjoys inner peace in proportion to the tension existing in his body and spirit.
The less tension, the more positive the vital force is. Everyone has the potential ability to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can attain enlightenment, and this goal is only hindered by our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of love of the Mahayana ritual and by various techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It is based on Kundalini Yoga, meditation and an all-embracing path of love.
Kundalini Yoga activates the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) through the use of yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualisations.
Deity Yoga is the core of Tibetan meditation. By visualizing various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is developed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, systemic, procedural and cultural conflicts led to a break between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would have lasted for the next 40 years and would have been fought for real, by mercenary armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and in many other countries.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence had already been broken through; the only option was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans proved to be obsolete almost immediately, as more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers advanced and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Using ships to transport goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the navy has always been to guarantee the country the safeguarding of its ability to move people and goods, while at the same time countering the ability of enemies to move their people and goods.
One of the recent examples in support of this theory and most notably is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. During the battle, the Americans were trying to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to support Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, attempted to disrupt this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have had the chance to conquer Great Britain, just as it had done in the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
They were domesticated by ancient cultures and tribes for their milk, wool, meat and hides.
Domestic goats were usually raised in herds that were allowed to roam the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by caprari (similar to shepherds) who were often children or teenagers. These methods of pastoralism are still used today.
Wagonways were already being built in England in the 16th century.
Although they were simply formed of parallel wooden planks, the wagonways, compared to the slightly more bumpy roads of the period, allowed horses to travel faster and carry heavier loads.
The sleepers were introduced relatively early to keep the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was realised that the rails would be more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
It became a common practice, although the iron caused greater wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Finally, wooden wheels gave way to iron ones. In 1767, the first completely iron rails appeared.
The first means of transport that mankind knew were the legs. Humans started walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means "upright man").
Its predecessor, the australopithecine, did not habitually walk upright.
Bipedal walking specialization signs are present in Australopithecus fossils dating back to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate future suffering to some extent, we can start to adopt more environmentally friendly lifestyles, we can join the environmental movement and also do activism.
In many cases this only works as a symptomatic treatment. If we do not want only a temporary solution, we should find the ultimate cause of the problems and deactivate it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of humanity, while the problems have increased due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
After Congress adopted it on July 4, a manuscript copy signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were produced that night, known today as the "Dunlap broadsides."
The document was first read publicly on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall, and the task was entrusted to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops stationed in New York on July 9, while a copy arrived in London on August 10.
Dunlap's 25 known broadsides are the oldest extant copies of the document; the original manuscript is lost.
According to many paleontologists today, one category of dinosaurs survived and is still alive. They are the ones we call birds.
Many tend not to consider them dinosaurs because of the feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds share many characteristics with dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they have scaly feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs.
Ultimately, the manipulation of information encoded as binary numbers is the basis of all computers currently in use.
A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and in technical computer language these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and its symptoms, including vomiting, are very general, making it impossible to make an immediate diagnosis.
The main sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or hazardous chemicals in the home.
Check the label for first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term mite is used formally by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the familiarity in ancient times with bed bugs, insects that have strongly adapted to become parasites of man.
Both bed bugs and assassin bugs are nesting, meaning they are adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States of America, multiple sclerosis (MS) affects around 400,000 people, making it the most common neurological disease affecting young adults and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has highlighted that the chances of developing MS in females are double that of males.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their interest, or in the interest of their child.
These couples have the possibility to choose an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the natural parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides most scientific inquiry.
But it is not just experimentation, since an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also allows scientific research to be guided.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on the various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the gradual decline of the Greek language, the West was isolated from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior are critically dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been documented, which are not just reactions to external periodic signals, in relation to most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was the one conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments highlighting the bacteriophage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a range of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material involved and whether the cells affected are germ line cells.
Mutations that can be passed on to children are only those in germ cells; mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including flora and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, park visits, and studying ecosystem information.
For example, by visiting, photographing and getting to know the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small rural towns in their cars to go to work, crossing paths with others whose workplace is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic give-and-take, everyone is somehow connected to and supporting a private car-based transportation system.
Today science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere outside of one of its conditions of stability that allowed human evolution over the past two million years.
Every person participates in social life and uses transport systems, which almost everyone complains about.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about the quality of water or the bridges falling into disrepair.
Why do transport systems attract so many complaints, why are they failing every day? Is it because the engineers who design them are incompetent, or are there deeper motivations?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is complex because driversâ€™ behaviour cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, driver behavior tends to fall within a reasonably constant range, so traffic flows themselves tend to show a reasonable constancy and can be represented mathematically in a generic way.
To obtain a more accurate representation of the traffic flow, the three main variables were correlated: (1) volume, (2) density and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for planning, designing and managing road structures.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. The ability to fly allowed them to escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Many insects are helped by the ability to fold their wings along their bodies.
This allows them to exploit a greater variety of small crevices to hide from predators.
Of all the insects alive today, the only ones that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the Sun.
Some were right, but many others believed the opposite, that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and other stars as well), moved around the Earth.
Which seems sensible, because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the largest and second-longest river in the world, carrying 8 times the amount of water as the second-largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river in the world, with a width of up to six miles in some places.
20% of the total water that flows from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It is fed by the waters of thousands of smaller tributaries.
Stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in terms of size and technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were still enchanted by the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the one with the smallest population.
The official language of the Vatican City for legislation and official communications is Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most people working within the state, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
In the Vatican City all citizens are Roman Catholics.
The man began to get to know the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper already in ancient times: these elements can be discovered in nature in native form and can be extracted quite easily with the help of primitive tools.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is made up of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
These do indeed resemble the four states of matter, namely (in order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma. However, he also theorised that they transform into new substances, forming what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains numerous elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There can also be alloys composed of small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter, and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly small, so many trillions of them could fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
After its invention, the pencil has proved to be a good friend for many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and less widespread use.
Today everyone types messages on computer screens and never has to approach a thermometer.
We can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something new arrives.
The principle that energy is required to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is the basis of the operation of the fission bomb.
It's like rolling a heavy cart up a hill, so by further dividing the nucleus, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break apart in the presence of little or no force.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust, and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under mountainous areas.
The maria may be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner, which has facilitated the upwelling of lava to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they grow up.
These theories look at what it is that unites some people and drives them to want to do what they do, and what are the factors in the context in which they live that drive them to do or not do certain things.
Among the most popular content theories are Maslowâ€™s Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzbergâ€™s Two-Factor Theory.
In general, when managers start to manage their former colleagues, two behaviours can emerge. On the one hand, there are those who try to remain "one of the guys" (or the girls).
The manager of this type finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, to implement disciplinary actions, to evaluate performance, to define and assign responsibilities.
At the opposite extreme, the manager becomes a completely different person, feeling that he must change the entire operation of the team and make it his own.
In the end, the leader is the person who is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often creates disagreements between leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence for virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with a few differences.
Members of the virtual team often serve as the point of contact for their next physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as meetings can take place according to different time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
The management team to which each member refers is called the "invisible team" and it is the one that establishes the standards for each member.
Why should an organization want to go through the long process of building a learning organization? A good reason for implementing the concepts of organizational learning may be innovation.
When you can effectively utilize all available resources in all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the path of collaboration within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
For an organization to be innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates the theory of the continuum as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
The neurobiological results have demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. The research area becomes narrower and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behaviour is the basis of the researchers' work.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumours can affect behaviour and modify certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and brain processes that have never been observed before.
This gives us a wealth of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Despite having a strong science fiction connotation, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research includes building machines to automate operations that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of applications include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and queries, as well as recognising handwriting, voice and facial features.
These things have become distinct disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in economic, medical, engineering and military fields, and are also integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are an essential part of education, and teachers often want to take their students to places that are not accessible by bus.
The solution is offered by technology with virtual tours. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great excuse to share travel experiences and reflections with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennet School, North Carolina, design a website about their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. Often, their first blogging experiences are marked by poor grammar and spelling, but the presence of an audience tends to change that.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative judgments the blog author is committed to improving writing.
Blogs also "force students to become more aware of the moment they are in." The need to feed the public's interest motivates students to be ingenious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop students' learning well beyond the normal school day.
"Proper use of blogs 'can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their own position within the writings of others, as well as delineate their own perspectives on specific issues' (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the charming and bilingual capital of Canada, rich in art galleries and museums that tell the story of the country's past and present.
Further south, you can visit the Niagara Falls, and to the north, you can admire the natural beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All of this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
The broad areas to the north are sparsely populated, some of them being almost uninhabited wildernesses.
If you compare the population, the result can be surprising for many: in the United States, the number of African-American citizens is higher than the number of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a continent in its own right.
Almost all of the smaller islands, known as luxurious seaside resorts, are mostly independent nations or associated with France.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the land, which embarked on a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape Route, which goes from Europe to India, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama paved the way for European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, while to the south and west it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean.
For travellers: all women are advised to declare themselves as married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassment, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Have the strength to refuse men, and do not be afraid to say no (cultural differences or not, there is no excuse!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE; under the name of Anfa, it was a port of strategic importance used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city, which was called Daru l-Badya, and then it was called Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who chose this place for their commercial bases.
Of all the cities in Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting for shopping.
In the vicinity of the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and lots of trinkets, but all of this is reserved only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying much of the city's streets, especially those in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is advisable to research thoroughly before undertaking any visits outside of Goma, in order to assess the state of the ongoing conflict in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the least expensive opportunities to see Africa's mountain gorillas.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Also because of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has ended up becoming a metaphor for exotic and distant land.
Today Timbuktu is a decaying city, but for its reputation it remains a tourist attraction, equipped with an airport.
In 1990 it was included in the list of UNESCO World Heritage sites in danger, due to the threat posed by desert sands.
It was one of the featured stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World."
With its more Arabic than African touch, the city stands out from the others in the country.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and stretches east along the border with Mozambique, to the north it borders Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
Covering an area of 19,500 kmÂ², the park comprises 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's top attractions and is considered the most important of South Africa's national parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees.
A Wild Card purchase could also be useful, as it allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong, which gives its name to the entire territory, is the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been likened to a glittering bar graph, made all the more striking by being framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the waterfront of Kowloon across the bay.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development has been concentrated on the reclaimed land of the densely populated north shore.
This is the place that the English colonizers chose for themselves, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this land, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove coastal belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast into the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest included in the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only made up of mangrove swamps: they also contain what is left of the impressive jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 kmÂ², of which about a third is made up of marshy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for wildlife; it is estimated that there are 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang) depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
As the shuttle buses between different districts are often full, it is a good idea to buy your ticket a few days in advance.
Most neighborhoods are served by comfortable and sturdy Japanese minibuses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby locations, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
Its two pylons are 83 metres high, it is 378 metres long and has two lanes that are 3.50 metres wide.
The free vertical space under the bridge is 15 metres. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
In September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge should be fully operational.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group living in present-day eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and the PayaguÃ¡, who lived off hunting, gathering and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Province of the Indies," was born in the 16th century from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish started a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
Since the foundation of AsunciÃ³n in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its identity and its native peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina boasts one of the best teams and players of polo in the world.
In December, the most important tournament of the year takes place in the polo fields of Las CaÃ±itas.
Here you can watch minor tournaments and games at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and purchasing tickets for polo matches, contact the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
Falkland Islands has its own official currency, the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to the British pound sterling (GBP).
The islands' only bank, located in Stanley opposite FIC West, offers currency exchange services.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are often accepted in Stanley.
It is likely that in the outlying islands they will not accept credit cards, although British and US currency may be accepted. Check with the owners in advance to decide on an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so change your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months temperatures over 30Â°C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no defined "dry" and "rainy" seasons: the amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year.
Even though many of the park's animals are used to human visitors, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials recommend keeping at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife.
No matter how docile they may seem: bison, moose, deer, bears, practically all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured for not keeping a proper distance. These animals need to be given enough space as they are large, wild and potentially dangerous.
Also, remember that odors can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking very strong-smelling foods, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoa Islands. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This port saw the infamous 1889 naval standoff, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the Mau movement's struggle for independence, a peaceful rally in the town resulted in the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the paramount chief.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is situated between two harbours. The most popular ones are divided into three areas.
The Pacific Ocean beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are mainly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook Waitemata Harbour.
These are family-friendly beaches that can get crowded at times, surrounded by a wide range of shops. Swimming is safe.
The most well-known local beer is a non-complex, pleasant and refreshing beer called "Number One". The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can get many French wines, but Australian and New Zealand wines might cope better with the journey.
The tap water is totally safe to drink, but if you are worried, bottled water is easy to find.
According to Australians, the 'flat white' coffee was born from a foreign idea. 'Espresso' is short black coffee, cappuccino is covered with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is on par with Belgian hot chocolate. Fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Throughout the year, many excursions are made to the coral reef and accidents due to one of these causes on the coral reef are rare.
Always seek advice from the authorities, follow their instructions and pay particular attention to safety notices.
Box jellyfish appear from October to April near the beaches and river estuaries north of Seventeen Seventy, and outside this period they can only be found occasionally.
Sharks are present, but rarely attack humans. Most sharks fear humans and tend to keep their distance.
The saltwater crocodiles' habitat is mainly the river estuaries north of Rockhampton, with them not actively living in the ocean.
By booking in advance, the traveller has the peace of mind of finding a place to sleep once they have arrived at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with certain hotels, but it is still possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages that include breakfast, transfers to and from the airport or even flight+hotel packages.
They can also hold the booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or to get additional documents required for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests must be made beforehand to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, most attendees choose to camp on site, considering this a crucial part of the experience.
To be close to the action, you need to get there early and grab a spot near the music.
Remember that once the main stages have finished, there may be sections of the festival where the music goes on until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the North Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice causes quite a bit of noise for those who are most exposed to it.
St. Petersburg cruises include time for you to explore the city, and cruise passengers are granted visa-free entry (check conditions).
Generally, casinos do everything they can to increase the amount of time and money their guests spend there. There are typically no windows or clocks, and exits can be hard to find.
They usually offer exclusive food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests in high spirits and make them stay.
In some establishments, alcoholic beverages are offered by the house. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and every good gambler knows how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice or temperatures close to zero.
On icy and snow-covered carriageways, the friction is reduced and it is not possible to drive as when on clean asphalt.
In a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in such a short time that you can get stuck.
Precipitation and snow squalls, or the formation of ice or condensation on the vehicle windows, can also reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the centerpiece of many visitors' holidays.
In its popular usage, the term safari refers to overland trips, particularly in the savannah, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to come closer to cars, so normal equipment is enough to get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, which is why you can observe them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk", "hiking safari", or "foot safari") is a hike that can last a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2012, and some events will take place in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, the first of which took place in 1964.
If your booking for flights and accommodation for 2020 was made before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but most coronavirus-related cancellation policies as of late March 2020 donâ€™t extend until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that the cost of most event tickets will be between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, while regular tickets will cost around 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry faster. Many hotels offer the use of an iron and ironing board, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if you have one.
Be careful not to expose the fabrics to too high temperatures, to avoid shrinkage or, in the worst case, burning.
There are various ways to sanitize water, and some of these are more effective against specific risks.
In some areas, it is enough to boil the water for a minute, in others it takes many minutes.
The effectiveness of filters is variable, so in case of doubts it is advisable to evaluate the purchase of water packaged in sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travellers may come into contact with animal parasites that are not found in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, as well as spread poison or infections.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with force are not usually classified as harmful animals.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy tax-free and duty-free products in certain locations.
Travellers heading to high-tax countries can sometimes save a lot, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The Buffalo-Pittsburgh section of the highway between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most challenging to drive, as it often passes through isolated areas of vegetation.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, it is advisable to keep your eyes wide open, as steep slopes, narrow roads and sharp bends predominate.
The posted speed limits are much lower than those on the previous and following stretches (normally 35-40 mph/56-64 km/h). Their strict observance is extremely important.
Strangely, however, the mobile phone coverage in this area is much better than in other parts of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite flavoursome and varied, similar to those of nearby Austria further south.
Fruit desserts are a timeless classic, from apples all year round to cherries and plums, which make an appearance during the summer.
Several German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. The most popular cakes often go very well with a cup of strong coffee.
Those who want to taste small but flavourful cakes can opt for those that, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices mixed with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid it contains.
In northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used for curries in the inland regions; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more commonly used.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a generic term covering a wide variety of regional cuisines found in the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term generally refers to foods originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island, Java.
The cuisine of Java, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a series of dishes of simple preparation; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially the Indonesian coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet and are hung on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can present safety problems because the rider's feet can become trapped.
If a jockey is thrown off a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged along by the escaping horse. To minimise this risk, there are some safety measures that can be taken.
First of all, most knights wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather thin sole.
Later, some saddles, especially English ones, included safety bars, which cause a leather strap to break away from the saddle when, in the event of a fall, the rider pulls it back.
CochamÃ³ Valley: Chile's most important climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, where there are a large number of enormous granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks include breathtaking vistas, and climbers from all over the world are continually tracing new routes up its potentially infinite walls.
Downhill snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular and involve sliding down snow using skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts many enthusiasts, sometimes even called "ski bums", who dedicate entire holiday periods to skiing in a particular area.
The principle behind skiing is very old: the first cave paintings depicting humans skiing date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport has its origins in at least the 17th century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia by Norwegians.
Ski touring: the activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski mountaineering or ski touring.
It is linked, even if it does not usually understand it, to touring skiing or skimo, which are practiced on steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski run as a hiking trail.
If conditions are good, you can cover distances somewhat greater than when walking, but you will only rarely reach cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it is made up of many independent countries. Normally, when travelling through multiple countries, you would need to apply for a visa and go through passport control multiple times.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area functions more like a single country.
If you stay within this area, you can usually go from one border to the other without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual member countries, thus saving time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what makes an item an antique. Some tax agencies consider an item to be an antique if it is at least 100 years old.
The definition has geographical differences from the age limit which may be lower, as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
Craft items could be described as antiques, even if they are more recent than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood for the SÃ¡mi and the culture that underpins this trade is also the basis of many other professions.
Even over time, not all SÃ¡mi have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding; some lived off fishing, hunting and similar activities, using reindeer mainly as work animals.
Today, many SÃ¡mi people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in SÃ¡pmi, the SÃ¡mi homeland.
Although widely used, particularly among non-Roma, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive because of its association with negative stereotypes and a misperception of Roma people.
If a travel warning is issued for the destination you are visiting, there may be consequences for your travel health insurance or your cancellation insurance.
You may also be interested in the opinions of governments other than your own, but keep in mind that these opinions are aimed at the citizens of those governments.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The alerts are simply a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions reported are often superficial, general and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Adverse weather conditions" is the general expression used to describe any dangerous meteorological phenomenon that may cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and there are many different types, depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, above-average rainfall and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similarly to thunderstorms, tornadoes, sea tornadoes and cyclones.
Among regional and seasonal weather phenomena of high intensity are thunderstorms, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travellers are advised to check the weather conditions in their area, as they may affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could potentially be considered a war zone must undergo professional training.
By searching the Internet for 'Hostile Environment Training' you are likely to find the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A typical course lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing games, as well as many training activities on first aid and sometimes on weapons.
Books and magazines about survival in the wild are abundant, while publications about war zones are few and far between.
Travellers who plan to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have valid travel documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without sex markers (X) or to update documents to match a desired name and gender is variable.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept such documents is equally variable.
Even security checks have become much more thorough in the post-9/11 era.
Pre-operative transgender people should not expect to pass through security without their privacy and dignity being violated.
Rip currents are formed by the return flow of waves breaking on the beach, often near a coral reef or similar formation.
Due to the submarine topography, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current towards the open sea can form.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion in attempting to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back will not be any more difficult than normal.
Try to find a place where you are not likely to get trapped again, or consider waiting for rescue based on your skills and whether you have been spotted.
Re-entry shock is shorter than culture shock (since there is a shorter "honeymoon" phase), lasts longer, and can be more serious.
Travelers who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes have difficulty readjusting to the culture of their home country.
When you return home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the customs of your home culture.
In your first experience abroad, you are likely to have encountered patient and understanding people, aware that travelers in a new country need to adjust.
Many people did not imagine that patience and awareness were also necessary for those returning home.
The light and sound show at the pyramid is the most interesting thing for children in the area.
Before the start of the show, it will be possible to admire the pyramids immersed in darkness and silence.
Normally, you can always hear the noise caused by tourists and vendors. The light and sound show is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx becomes the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and each pyramid is lit up.
Claimed by various countries, the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the largest number of bases, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the caldera of an active volcano has filled with water to create a magnificent natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the region located to the south of the peninsula and overlooks the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the peninsula's mountains merge into the plateau, then re-emerge as the Ellsworth Mountains, a 360-km-long chain bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Range, boasts the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4,892 m (15,900 ft) with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, where there is no mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only possible alternative.
A satellite phone is not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outside with a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by recreational boaters, including those on houseboats, as well as by missions that need remote data and voice.
Your local phone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
One of the increasingly popular options for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly popular among recent graduates, as they can take a year off before starting university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad during the gap year can actually increase the chances of returning to higher education in the home country.
Usually, enrollment in these educational programs requires payment of a fee.
Finland is an ideal destination for boating enthusiasts. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, both within the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You donâ€™t necessarily need a yacht for the archipelagos and lakes.
Even if the coastal archipelagos and the larger lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national pastime, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This also happens in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but it is a rather singular fact (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one to forty).
Many of the different Baltic cruises include a multi-day stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic town for two full days, returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.
For landing on the ground, a separate visa will not be required (as of 2009) using the onboard excursions.
Some brochures also offer cruises to Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea, and visiting the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be daunting for people of all ages and conditions, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not unlike the fears and personal aversions that many people manifest towards other things.
For some people, understanding a bit about how planes work and what happens during a flight can be helpful in overcoming a fear based on the unknown or a lack of control.
Delivery drivers are well paid to deliver products quickly. Often, timing is very important in the case of business documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
For some routes the larger companies use their own planes, but for other routes and for smaller companies there were problems.
On some routes, air shipments would take days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to get it there faster would be to ship it as checked baggage, and that's where you come in, since airline rules don't allow bags to be shipped without a passenger.
To fly first or business class, the obvious way is to pay a lot of money for the privilege (or, even better, convince your company to do so).
However, the price to pay is high: you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for Business travel and up to eleven times the fare for First Class travel!
In general, on direct flights from A to B, it is not even worth looking for discounts on first class or business class seats.
Airlines know there is a category of travelers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau and the local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has been the scene of ethnic conflict in the past.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is Christian Orthodox.
Istanbul is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important transport hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna is spread out over a huge bay, is surrounded by mountains and currently constitutes a modern, developed and active commercial center.
Although the city has a Mediterranean European feel rather than traditional Turkey, wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centres are dotted with the distinctive red-tiled roofs, 18th-century market, and ancient mosques and churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and you can visit a unique octagonal church.
On the churchyard, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
Half an hour is enough to walk around the charming village.
To the north is the romantic and enchanting town of Sintra, which is easily accessible and became famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to the brilliant tale of its splendors written by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb 403 bus service runs regularly to Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north, visit the great sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (place of worship), a place of Marian apparitions famous throughout the world.
Remember that the site you are visiting is basically a mass grave, and it has an almost incalculable significance to a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived these places, and many others who saw their loved ones murdered or worked to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Avoid jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Avoid defacing these places by marking the structures with signs or graffiti.
In the city of Barcelona, the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority is able to understand it; Spanish is known by practically everyone.
However, most of the signs are written exclusively in Catalan, which is the first official language by law.
Spanish, however, is also widely used for public transport and other services.
On the metro, regular announcements are only in Catalan. Any unscheduled service interruptions are communicated in a variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese, thanks to an automatic system.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and arrogant.
Even if it is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to feel at ease in Paris is still to behave as well as possible, relating to people as a "bien Ã©levÃ©" (well-bred) person. This will definitely make your travels easier.
The gruff exterior of Parisians will quickly disappear if you show some basic good manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is rich in forests, mainly beech, pine and fir, and is characterized by a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a multiplicity of microclimates, soils and altitude levels, it presents a great variety of plant communities.
The area is also home to a huge variety of animal and bird species.
Rare species such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and capercaillie live in these places, alongside several other more widespread animal species.
When visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and to cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries will provide stoles for women who arrive unprepared, but if you already have one, especially if it's brightly colored, you'll earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long pants down to their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the store at the entrance; however, the garments are not washed after each user, so wearing these skirts may not be comfortable. For men, one size fits all!
The cuisine of Majorca, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
Pa amb Oli is a simple, popular summer dish: bread with olive oil, tomato and any condiments you can find, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the pronoun "Sie" used for the polite form of "you," are always capitalized, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This represents an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
This aspect probably also facilitates reading, although the need to understand whether a verb or an adjective is used in a substantivized form makes the writing rather complex.
Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most words are pronounced the way they are spelled.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation changes depending on the vowel that follows.
Also, make sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: caro means dear, while carro means carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar handbook could help you a lot with Persian grammar and understanding sentences.
It goes without saying that if you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with a basic knowledge of Spanish may come to the hasty conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore does not need to be studied separately.
Nowadays, pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete and serve as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution was not a problem in their heyday, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, which are more easily accessible than modern-day sites.
Most modern research telescopes are huge structures in remote locations where the weather is good.
The admiration of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where the flowering of plum trees was preferred.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were organized by the emperor just for himself and other members of the aristocracy close to the imperial court.
Plants do their best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "just" one specimen.
If you visit an Italian garden, even picking up a few specimens of plants will cost you removal from this place, without discussion.
In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy city to navigate; you can buy just about anything once you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics," just a few degrees north of the equator, you'll have to contend with heat (always) and strong sun (more rarely, when the sky is clear).
Some buses also head north to Hebron, the traditional site of the burial of the Bible's patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and their wives.
Make sure the bus you want to take goes inside Hebron and doesn't stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great theme around which to organise a holiday.
For example, you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, take a cruise to visit the interesting cities on the Danube or sail on the Erie Canal.
They also define the routes of well-known hiking trails and cycle paths.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with this holiday have been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
One tradition is to spend Easter night staying awake in an open place to be able to admire the dawn.
There are of course Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could just as well be a pre-Christian fertility ritual linked to spring.
In more traditional churches, an Easter Vigil is often held on the Saturday night of the Easter weekend, with congregations often starting the ceremony at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally came to the islands arrived by swimming, flying or floating.
Because the distance from the mainland was considerable, mammals were unable to make the journey, which meant that the giant tortoise became the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Numerous mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs and cats were introduced to the Galapagos after the arrival of humans.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic during winter, you can experience the polar night, when the sun stays below the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the possibility of seeing the Northern Lights, because the sky remains dark almost all day.
Since the territories are sparsely populated, light pollution is often not a problem and you can also enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners tend to be used to.
Business attire usually consists of a jacket and tie or a suit, and colleagues are addressed by their last name or professional title.
The harmony of the workplace is of crucial importance, as it emphasizes the commitment of the group rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often need approval from their superiors for every decision, and are expected to follow instructions without question.
