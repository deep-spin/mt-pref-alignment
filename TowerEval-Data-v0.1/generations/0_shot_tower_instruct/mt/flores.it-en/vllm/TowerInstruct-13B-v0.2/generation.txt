"We have four-month-old mice that were diabetic and now are not," he added.
The study is still in its early stages, as cautioned by Dr. Ehud Ur, a professor of medicine at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and director of clinical and scientific affairs at the Canadian Diabetes Association.
Like other experts, he is sceptical about the possibility of curing diabetes, stressing that these results are not relevant for those already suffering from type 1 diabetes.

USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes the absolute necessity for the Olympic community to work together to create a safe environment for all of its athletes.
We agree with the USOC that the best interests of our athletes and our clubs, and our sport, can be best served by bringing about meaningful change within our organization, rather than decertification.
USA Gymnastics has launched an independent investigation to understand how abuse of the size described so courageously by those who have survived Larry Nassar could have been hidden for so long, and is committed to implementing whatever changes are necessary or appropriate.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the same goal: to make gymnastics and all sports as safe as possible so athletes can pursue their dreams in a trustworthy, positive and accountable environment.

This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely accepted, but provides more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was brownish-rust on the upper part, with a pale or carotenoid coloration on the lower part.
The discovery also allows for detailed information about the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the dinosaur's plumage does not have the basic structure, the so-called rachis, but instead has other features typical of feathers, barbs and barbules, the researchers concluded that the rachis is probably the result of an evolutionary development subsequent to these features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or courtship. The researchers hypothesize that, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the find shows adult plumage and not the down of a chick.
According to the researchers' hypotheses, despite the fact that the tail belongs to a young dinosaur, the sample reveals plumage from an adult specimen and not that of a chick.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two officers and injuring more than twenty people.

They found that the Sun's workings are based on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all stars in the solar system is determined by nothing more than their brightness and rotation.
Brightness is used together with rotation to define a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is compared to magnetic reversals.

He also added that they should not, however, be forced to take on obligations that go beyond their stage of development, as well as their responsibilities and competencies.
The Iraq Study Group presented its report today at 12:00 GMT.
He warns: "No one can guarantee that any action in Iraq at this time will stop sectarian warfare, increasing violence or a slide into chaos."
The report begins with a call for open debate and the creation of a consensus in the United States about policy toward the Middle East.
The report is highly critical of almost every aspect of the government's current policy on Iraq and calls for an immediate change of direction.
The first of its 78 recommendations is to launch a new diplomatic initiative by the end of this year to protect Iraq's borders from hostile actions and to resume diplomatic relations with its neighbors.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the surveys of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for was to be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter in this galaxy and the dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a gravitational pull on Earth that creates tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to deduce that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same effects that "normal" matter has.
This theory suggests that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is collected in a kind of halo, made up of a multitude of tiny particles.
Television reports show white smoke coming out of the plant.
Local authorities are warning people living near the plant to stay indoors, turn off air conditioning and not drink tap water.

Dr Tony Moll has identified extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province.
According to a statement released in an interview, this new variant was "highly concerning and alarming, because of the high mortality rate."
Dr Moll said some patients may have picked up the bug inside the hospital, and at least two of them were hospital staff.
In the course of a year an infected person can contaminate from 10 to 15 close contacts.
Nevertheless, the proportion of XDR-TB in the whole group of people with TB still seems low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any one time in South Africa.

The government has also promised several million doses of the encephalitis vaccine, so that health facilities are not caught unprepared next year.
Delivery plans for vaccines in historically hard-hit areas this year have been delayed for lack of funding and because they were given a low priority compared to other diseases.
Three years after his move to Sweden in 1956, Słania began working for the Swedish Post Office, becoming its chief engraver.
He created more than 1,000 stamps, both for Sweden and for a further 28 countries.
The quality and detail of his work is so recognised that he has become one of the very few "household names" among philatelists, with some even specialising in collecting his work alone.
In 2000, it got its thousandth stamp, the magnificent "Great Deeds by Swedish Kings" by David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl, which is listed in the Guinness Book of Records.
His work also included engraving banknotes for many countries, with recent examples of this work being the portraits of the Prime Minister on the front of the new Canadian $5 and $100 banknotes.

After the dam was built in 1963, the seasonal floods that spread sediment along the river stopped.
This sediment has been critical in the creation of both beaches and sandbars that have become habitats for wildlife.
As a result, two species of fish have become extinct and two more are at risk of extinction, including the humpbacked goby.
Although the flood will only raise the water level by a few metres, the authorities hope that it will be enough to restore the sandbanks eroded further downstream.

The entrances to the caves, dubbed "The Seven Sisters," all have a diameter of at least 100-250 meters (328-820 feet).
Infrared images show thermal oscillations between day and night, demonstrating that they are probably caves.
During the day they are colder than the surrounding surface and at night they are warmer.
Glen Cushing of the US Geological Survey's astrogeology team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona, said: "Their thermal behaviour is not consistent with that of large terrestrial caves, which often maintain a relatively stable temperature, but is consistent with being deep holes in the ground."
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: Voters enter a booth, fill out a pre-printed slip indicating their choice, and drop it into a box.
After his identity has been verified by the officials, the voter deposits the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral register.
The French electoral law codifies the procedures in a rather strict manner.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers can testify that at the beginning of the vote there are no envelopes and that no other envelopes are inserted other than those of the voters, duly counted and authorized.
Candidates can send their representatives to attend every stage of the process, and in the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, in accordance with specific procedures.

The first in the slalom, where he recorded a DNF in the first descent. Another 36 competitors out of 116 in the same race did not complete the test.
The other race she participated in, the giant slalom, saw her finish tenth in the women's sitting category, with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than first-placed Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than ninth-placed Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four female skiers failed to finish their downhill runs, and 45 of the 117 competitors in the giant slalom did not qualify for the race.
Madhya Pradesh police managed to recover the laptop and mobile phone that were stolen.
Deputy Inspector General DK Arya said: "Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman. We have also found her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
None of the three people who were in the house at the time of the car crash were injured.
Nevertheless, the driver was seriously injured to the head.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya is now at Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with killing her own child.
She is being held pending trial and a trial, but any testimony from an eyewitness could be tainted, as her image has been widely published.
It is common practice in other parts of the UK but Scottish justice has different parameters. Scottish courts have found the publication of the photos potentially prejudicial.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee, "journalists who publish pictures or other material of suspects are walking on a minefield."
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecutions, told reporters there would be no further comment until at least formal charges are laid.
According to leaks, the subject of the document will be the dispute over borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders existing before the Middle East War of 1967.
Other topics reportedly discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement was signed, Israel demanded a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agreed to abandon this presence for only five years.
The shooters within the experimental pest control program had to be closely monitored by the rangers, as the experiment was being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program, the NPWS, in conjunction with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the Park Conservation and Heritage of the NPWS, the four shooters chosen for the first shooting operation received exhaustive training and safety instructions.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth provisional electoral council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission proposed a package of measures aimed at pushing the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests, which began in October, against the regime.
Occasionally violent protests have been sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which were scheduled as far back as 2011.
There have been about 60 reports of overheating in malfunctioning iPods, which have caused a total of six fires and caused minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of another 34 incidents related to overheating, which the company described as "not serious."
In its response, the ministry called Apple's delay in submitting the report "absolutely deplorable."
The earthquake in the Mariana Islands was felt at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management, no damage was reported in the nation.
And the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported there were no tsunami warnings in effect.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino policeman took hostage some tourists from Hong Kong after hijacking their bus.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Many of the hostages were saved, at least six died.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were immediately released along with the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
After training in midwifery, she joined the staff of Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, in his spare time Liggins began to study cases of premature labor.
His research showed that administering the hormone would speed up the maturation of the lungs in the foetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday retrieved two "black boxes" with flight recordings.
Even his fellow wrestlers wanted to pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, just like her. A strong woman."
"Luna was as weird as me... Maybe even more... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she is in a better place," was the comment of Dustin "Goldust" Runnels.
According to a poll of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election, opposition to Australia becoming a republic rose 8 per cent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, then-acting prime minister Julia Gillard said she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
This view is shared by 34% of poll participants, who believe that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
At the other end of the poll, 29 per cent of respondents said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent said it should never become one.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games but has been plagued by a series of ailments that have cast doubt over her fitness.
He was unable to take the necessary painkillers because they are banned from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at Central Missouri University, discovered the largest prime number ever known to date.
The discovery was verified by several people using different hardware and software in early February, and was announced Tuesday.
Comets could have been one of the sources that brought water and organic matter, that is, matter capable of forming proteins and supporting life, to Earth.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and in particular how the Earth formed, by colliding with comets a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, has been in office since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he signed a law that makes same-sex marriage legal.
In his opinion, speculation is nothing more than "political chatter and nonsense".
He is rumoured to be running for president in 2016.
The FAA says the NextGen system will allow planes to fly more direct routes and save millions of gallons of fuel a year, reducing carbon emissions.
The system uses satellite technology instead of outdated ground-based radar to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transport is being laid on and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, while there is no car parking or interchange parking at the site.
The fears linked to the absence of transport have made the possibility of the match being played behind closed doors, without the support of the team's fans, emerge.
According to a study published on Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of bird has emerged on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers from Princeton University, USA, and Uppsala University, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that the time required for this process was much greater; this was due to the mating between a Darwin endemic finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into any shape. It can be rolled up to create tiny shapes.
It can be drawn out to form a thin wire, suitable for twisting and weaving. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts" because of its ability to be made so thin.
This is the so-called pH of the substance. Using red cabbage juice, it is possible to construct a pH indicator.
The juice of the cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
The pH level of the chemical being tested is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the H in pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons stripped away (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dried powders together and then, with clean, wet hands, roll them into a ball.
Between the moisture on your hands and the outer layers, a reaction will occur that will cause a strange sensation and form a sort of shell.
Almost all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with running water connected to an advanced sewage system.
In Greece, the remains of sewer systems have been discovered in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini.
In ancient times, toilets also existed in Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilisation, they were sometimes included in public baths, which were frequented by a mixed public of men and women.
To call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then beams it back almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space using a rocket, and scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts light and vision to some extent.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, a rocket more than 100 feet tall is needed.
The wheel has changed the world enormously. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important one is that it has provided us with simpler and faster transport.
Thanks to his invention, the train, the automobile and several other means of transportation made their appearance.
Below them are other medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats in the wild) that feed on much smaller prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The concept of niche is the secret of their success, a particular goal that every feline has and that allows them not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats and live in large groups called prides.
The packs are composed of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and cubs that can reach 30.
Usually the females are closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The lion pack behaves very similarly to the wolf or dog pack, whose behaviour is in fact surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not that of other big cats), even as regards deadly attacks on their prey.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (albeit not too well), swim, make very long jumps and exert a pulling force five times greater than that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard and jaguar. These four big cats are the only ones that roar.
The tiger's roar is not as powerful as the lion's, but it sounds more like a string of angry, shouted words.
Ocelots love to feed on small animals. If possible, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds and almost all the prey they catch are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that kittens follow and find their food (prey) thanks to their sense of smell, sniffing the ground where they have been.
Thanks to their night vision, they can see very well in the dark, and they are also able to move stealthily. To hunt their prey, ocelots camouflage themselves with the surrounding environment and then pounce on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the main population to which it belongs (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or river, or moves onto a new island, making it difficult to return), it will probably find itself in a different environment to the one it was in before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, so, to position itself as a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations than those needed before.
The native population has not changed at all; it still needs the same adaptations as before.
As time goes on and the new population adapts to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists of the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and is a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants process their food with the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants, we make our clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the superpredator of its era and for this reason it feared nothing, if not other mosasaurs.
More than 70 razor-sharp teeth protruded from its long jaws, plus an additional row on the palate, so there was no escape for anyone who crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that it had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and it's also possible that it was a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that came into the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex would not have been able to compete with it.
Although much of their food would be familiar to us, Roman banquets also included some strange or unusual dishes, such as wild boar, peacock, snails and a type of rodent called a wood pigeon.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate while sitting on chairs, the wealthy men loved to feast together while lying on their side while consuming their meal.
Of course, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include various foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a chief temple for each deity, which was regarded as the dwelling place of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to provide for the needs of the deities through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
Thanks to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, the house was not of fundamental importance.
Much of Jewish family life took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard, while the shops were simple outdoor counters that faced the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no great forests, so wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Nordic sagas it is said that Erik the Red gave it its name, having encountered Greenland on his travels after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although all "Scandinavian" countries, the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think that there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is false. Even though something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence reads "The original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776." The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
While it's not known for sure who wrote it, it's believed that at the beginning of its existence, the large parchment document (29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled up for storage.
So the annotation was probably just put on as a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent fighting had brought liberation to northern France, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the Vichy regime, those French who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and allied themselves with the invaders, instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France: this offensive action was called "Operation Dragoon".
American and Free French forces had liberated southern France in just two weeks and were heading towards Germany.
Civilization refers to a specific culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, constituting a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis", which means civil; the term is in turn connected with "civis", that is citizen, and "civitas", that is city or city-state, and in a certain way therefore also defines the dimensions of society.
City-states are the first realities to anticipate the idea of nation. Culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge through multiple generations, leaving an indelible cultural imprint through fair diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving any significant historical traces, and are therefore not recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states formed for the first time a weak central government, and Congress was its only component, according to the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes, and, given the absence of a national executive or judiciary, it relied on often uncooperative state authorities to enforce its acts.
It didn't even have the authority to bypass tax laws and tariffs between states.
To change the articles required the unanimous consent of all the states; and these, on their part, had so little respect for the central government, that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German team, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are: football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 car races.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions and see Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of almost 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
Geographically, Japan is referred to as an "archipelago" due to the presence of groups of islands that make it up.
Taiwan was born in the 15th century, when the European sailors who passed by soon recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or the wonderful island.
The Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan in 1624, beginning a transformation of the indigenous people's grain production systems and hiring Chinese laborers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan came under the control of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces; in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the first Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, thereby ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan; the island remained under Japanese rule until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the outlying buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
In 1976, 30% of the Machu Picchu site had been recovered, but restoration work is still ongoing.
The most common format in the world for still photography, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the most commonly used film at the end of the era of analogue photography.
It is still produced today and, more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strangely, the height of the 35mm format is 24mm and its width is 36mm.
The proportions of this format (divide by twelve to get the simplest ratio of whole numbers) are therefore considered to be 3:2.
The proportions of many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are equal to or very close to this value.
The oft-exploited and often derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while still maintaining a sense of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point to place the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
At this stage in European history, the Catholic Church, having become wealthy and powerful, found itself under scrutiny.
The Christian religion had acted as a glue between the European states for over a thousand years, despite linguistic and cultural differences.
Its ubiquitous power influenced everyone from the king to the common citizen.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary reserves exist for this very reason.
The central authority of the church has remained in Rome for over a thousand years, and this convergence of power and money has led many to wonder if this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective: it provided for the interruption of any essential military and civilian supplies, despite the fact that this blockade violated international law, which is usually accepted and codified by multiple international treaties of the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to deny access to whole sections of the ocean, endangering neutral ships as well.
As this tactic had elicited a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its indiscriminate submarine warfare campaign.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer from the Edison Company in New York City, which led him to move to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his boss at his previous job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different periods of time were named in a very unique way: each period of China or each family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
Even the intervals between individual dynasties were characterized by periods of instability and division between the provinces. The most famous was the so-called Three Kingdoms period, between the Han and Jin dynasties, which lasted for 60 years.
During these periods, fierce wars broke out between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying as they fought for a place of honour in the grand palace in Xi'an.
The social and political effects are numerous, among which we can mention the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to the republic, nationalism and the conviction that the nation belongs to the people and is not the property of a single sovereign.
Moreover, after the Revolution, professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same goes for the military, as army rankings, instead of being based on class, are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers in various countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters beyond this life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, offers a very clear picture of the spirituality of Mohammed.
The cave sits atop one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely cut off from the rest of the world.
In reality it is not at all easy to find, even if you know it exists. Once inside the cave, the isolation is total.
You see nothing but a beautiful clear sky and a lot of mountains around. From inside the cave you can see or hear very little of the surrounding world.
Among the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one that has reached our days not in a state of ruin.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramidal structures erected in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, is home to numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Khufu), various smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The important pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the Pharaoh's wives and family members.
The "arc up" indication looks like a V and the "arc down" indication looks like a paperclip or a square without the bottom side.
Up means you should start from the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start from the nock (which is where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow towards yourself.
An upward bow usually generates a softer sound, while a downward bow results in a stronger and more decisive sound.
You can decide to add your own personalised markings in pencil, but remember that the printed arching marks have a musical value, so they should be respected as a general rule.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of market women forced King Louis XVI, in a state of terror, to leave Versailles and return to Paris, along with Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, 11, and Louis Charles, 4), and Elizabeth, the king's sister.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and screaming threats against the monarchs.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The war expenses of US imperialism to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover much of the expenses and the interest on the bonds fluctuated in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly the huge profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the profits underpinning US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history that covers the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (from the year 1000 to 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or the technological imperative to the strict sense according to which the destiny of man is driven by an underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Much of the interpretation of technological determinism has in common two general ideas: one is that the development of technology itself follows a course that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the automobile necessarily involves the development of the road network.
However, a national road network for only a few cars is not economically sustainable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs associated with car ownership.
The mass possession of automobiles also leads to a higher percentage of accidents on the roads, and as a result, the invention of new techniques for the care of injured people.
Romanticism was characterized by a substantial component of cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography has conditioned individuals, and over time, customs, habits and culture linked to such geography have arisen, which, being in harmony with the context of society, have proved more effective than laws imposed arbitrarily.
Similarly to Paris, known today as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a nerve centre of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until around 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century its prestige declined, not least because the crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of Gothic style was reached in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the east.
But the slowness of the communication routes means that the spread of styles in the West can be delayed by 25-30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had developed its own style. One of the most significant developments of the time, as a result of the Crusades, was the introduction of buttons to fasten clothes.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence when it is practised solely for the purpose of producing enough to meet the food requirements of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, usually organic, that uses locally adapted seeds in association with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at getting the most out of the crops.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and in many developing countries, this is still the case.
Subcultures bring together individuals with the same opinions who do not feel represented by society's standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished by the age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, manners, and jargon.
One of the most commonly used methods of explaining the importance of socialization is to analyze some unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or the effect of intentional abuse, grew up without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "feral" or "wild". Some of them have been locked up by people (often their own parents): in some cases, the abandonment is motivated by the refusal of a serious intellectual or physical disability by the parents.
Feral children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Other children may have been raised by animals; still others seem to have lived alone in the wild.
When the feral child is totally raised by non-human animals, it shows behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely analogous to those of the particular animal that took care of it, such as fear or indifference towards man.
Project-based learning should make learning itself easier and more interesting, while scaffolding goes a bit further.
Scaffolding is not a mode of learning, but rather an aid for those who undertake a new learning experience, such as the use of a new computer program or the start of a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "scaffolding," but so is the little paperclip assistant in Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to question, stimulate and explain the procedures that the student may have had difficulty managing on their own.
Children are given into foster care for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, if not outright extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that does not guarantee nourishment, care and education, but it happens to them.
We believe that fostering represents a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to meet all the needs that were not met in the home from which they were removed.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the theory of uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord's (1998) study of audience reactions to Web sites identified two new aspects of motivation, "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships."
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that it is possible to tell if a person is lying by interpreting micro-expressions correctly.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks described how people who are unable to understand spoken language because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even argues that these skills in interpreting human behaviour can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research has shown the existence of two pools of genetic variability, namely hidden variability and expressed variability.
With mutation, a new genetic variability is added, with selection it is eliminated from the pool of expressed variability.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute the variability back and forth between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to meet their amino acid requirements with the plant resources available in the savannah.
Furthermore, the failure to carry out such activities has serious consequences: slowed growth, malnutrition and, eventually, even death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
Animal foods, on the other hand (such as ants, termites, and eggs), are not only easy to digest, but provide a high amount of protein, containing all essential amino acids.
In light of all this, it should come as no surprise that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the intentional waking process that occurs during the normal sleep period, followed by a return to sleep (10–60 minutes later).
This process can be easily put into practice by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to a state of consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you do decide to reset the alarm in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options focused on the biorhythm involve consuming a lot of liquids before going to bed (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which forces you to get out of bed to urinate.
A person enjoys an inner peace that is proportionate to the tension in his body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force that exists. Each of us has the potential ability to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. This goal is only hindered by our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been enriched by the path of love of the Mahayana ritual and by various techniques of Indian yoga.
Basically, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It is based on Kundalini Yoga, meditation and a path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini Yoga activates the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) through the use of yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the core of Tibetan meditation. Through the depiction of various deities, the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is developed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, systemic, procedural and cultural conflicts led to a break between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought for real, by mercenary armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other countries.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence had already been broken through; the only option was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans, however, proved immediately obsolete, as more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Using ships for the transport of goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the navies has always been to guarantee the country the safeguarding of its ability to move people and goods, while at the same time countering the same ability of the enemies to move their people and their goods.
One of the more notable recent examples supporting this theory is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II, where the Americans were trying to move men and goods across the Atlantic to support Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, tried to interrupt this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have had the chance to conquer Great Britain, just as it had done in the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
They were first bred by the cultures and tribes of antiquity to have milk, wool, meat and skin readily available.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that were allowed to roam freely on hillsides or other grazing areas, often tended by goatherds (similar to shepherds) who were often children or teenagers. These methods of herding are still used today.
In the 16th century, wagonways were already built in England.
Although simply made of parallel wooden planks, wagonways, when compared to the slightly more rugged roads of the period, allowed the horses that travelled on them to reach higher speeds and to move heavier loads.
The sleepers were introduced relatively early to hold the rails in place, but gradually it was realised that the rails would be more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
It became a common practice, even though the iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron appeared.
The first means of transportation that man has known were his legs. Humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means "upright man").
Its predecessor, Australopithecus, did not habitually walk upright.
Signs of specialization for bipedal locomotion are present in the fossils of Australopithecus dating back to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate future suffering we can start by adopting more environmentally friendly lifestyles, we can join the environmental movement and even do activism.
In many cases this only works as a symptomatic treatment. If we don't want just a temporary solution, we should find the root cause of the problems and disable it.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity, while problems have increased due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
After Congress adopted it on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to the printing office of John Dunlap a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were produced overnight, today known as "The Dunlap Broadside."
The document was first read publicly on July 8 in the yard of Independence Hall, and the task was entrusted to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops stationed in New York on July 9, while a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 shots of Dunlap still known are the oldest existing copies of the document. The original manuscript is lost.
According to many paleontologists today, one category of dinosaurs survived and is still alive. They are the ones we call birds.
Many tend not to consider them dinosaurs because of the feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds have many features in common with dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on their hind legs.
Ultimately, the manipulation of information encoded as binary numbers is at the heart of all computers in use today.
A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and in computer jargon these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious, and its symptoms, including vomiting, are very general, making it impossible to make an immediate diagnosis.
The main indication of internal poisoning could be the presence in the house of an open container of drugs or toxic chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term mite is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the familiarity in ancient times with bed bugs, insects that have strongly adapted to become parasites of humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are nest dwellers, meaning they are adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States of America, multiple sclerosis (MS) is responsible for around 400,000 known cases, making it the leading neurological disease affecting young people and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
The research showed that the likelihood of developing MS among females is double that of males.
A couple may decide that bringing up a child is not in their interest, or in the interest of their child.
These couples have the option to choose an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the natural parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific inquiry.
But it is not just about experimentation, since an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also allows scientific research to be directed.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on the various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the gradual decline of the Greek language, the West was isolated from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior are critically dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely responses to periodic external signals, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was that conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, which are viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments labeling the bacteriophage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a range of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material involved and whether the affected cells are in the germ line.
The mutations that can be passed on to children are only those in the germ cells; mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including wild flora and fauna.
Examples of activities to do on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, park visits and studying information about the ecosystem.
For example, by visiting, photographing and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns to drive to work, crossing paths with others whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic comings and goings, everyone is somehow connected to a transportation system based on private cars, which they also support.
Today science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere outside of one of its conditions of stability that has allowed human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in social life and uses transport systems, which almost everyone complains about.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges falling into disrepair.
Why do transport systems attract so many complaints, why are they failing every day? Are the engineers who design them incompetent, or are there deeper reasons?
"Traffic Flow" is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and the interactions that they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, driver behaviour tends to fall within a reasonably constant range, so, in turn, traffic flows tend to show reasonable constancy and can be represented generically in mathematical terms.
To get a more accurate representation of the traffic flow, the three main variables were correlated: (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for planning, designing and managing road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. The ability to fly allowed them to escape enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects are helped by the ability to fold their wings along their body.
This allows them to exploit a greater variety of small crevices to hide from predators.
Of all the insects in existence today, the only ones that are not capable of folding their wings are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some were right, but many others believed the opposite, that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and other stars), moved around the Earth.
Which makes sense, because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the largest river and the second longest river on Earth. It carries a volume of water eight times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with a width that in some places reaches six miles.
20% of the total water that flows from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and receives the waters of thousands of smaller tributaries.
Stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of size and technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom remained spellbound admiring the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the one with the smallest population.
The language of Vatican City for legislation and official communications is Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most people working within the state, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
In Vatican City all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man began to know the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper already in ancient times: these elements can be discovered in nature in native form and can be extracted in a fairly simple way with the help of primitive tools.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is made up of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
These do indeed resemble the four states of matter, namely (in order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma. However, he also theorised that they could transform into new substances, forming what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains numerous elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There may also be alloys composed of small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly tiny, so trillions of them could fit at the end of this sentence.
After its invention, the pencil has therefore proved to be a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and less widespread use.
Today everyone writes messages on computer screens and never has the need to approach a typewriter.
We can only wonder what fate the keyboard will meet when something newer comes along.
The principle that it takes energy to hold together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is the basis of how a fission bomb works.
It's like rolling a heavy cart up a hill, so by further dividing the nucleus, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break apart in the presence of little or no force.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountainous areas.
The Maria may be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner, which facilitated the rise of lava to the surface.
Content theories focus on the search for what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or wants that are internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what unites some people and drives them to want to do what they do, and what are the contextual factors in which they live that push them to do or not do certain things.
Among the most popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, when managers start to manage their former colleagues, two behaviours can emerge. On the one hand, there are those who try to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, to implement disciplinary actions, to evaluate performance, to define and assign responsibilities.
At the other extreme, the manager becomes a completely different person, who feels that they have to change the entire way the team operates and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is the person who is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often creates dissent between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence for virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with a few small differences.
Members of the virtual team often serve as the point person for their physical next group.
They often have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as meetings can take place according to different time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The existence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
The management team to which each member refers is defined as the "invisible team" and is the one that sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the long process of building a learning organization? A good reason for implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized in all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the collaborative journey within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer's needs.
For an organization to be innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates the continuum theory as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
The neurobiological results have demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. The area of research becomes narrower and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behaviour is at the heart of the scientists' research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors can affect behavior and change certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been observed before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Despite having a strong science fiction connotation, AI represents a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research includes the development of machines that can automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples of application are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as recognition of writing, vocal and facial.
These things have become distinct disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, and is also integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are a fundamental part of teaching, and often teachers would like to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution is offered by technology with virtual tours. Students can see the artifacts of museums, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great opportunity to share experiences and travel reflections with future classes.
For example, each year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned each year, but previous versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Often, their first experiences with blogging are marked by poor grammar and spelling, but having an audience usually changes that.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative judgments, the blog author is committed to improving his writing.
Blogs also "force students to become more aware of the moment around them." The need to keep the audience interested motivates students to be ingenious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop students' learning well beyond the normal school day.
Proper use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to materials on the Internet, students can define their position within the writings of others, as well as delineate their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the evocative and bilingual capital of Canada, rich in art galleries and museums that tell the past and present of the country.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and to the north you can admire the natural and unspoiled beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All of this and more makes Ontario quintessentially Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
The wide areas to the north are sparsely populated, among which some are almost uninhabited wild lands.
If you compare the population, the result may be surprising for many: in the United States, the number of African-American citizens is higher than that of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a continent in its own right.
Almost all of the smaller islands, known as luxurious seaside resorts, are mostly independent nations or associated with France.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, which then began a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape Route, which goes from Europe to India, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama paved the way for European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, while to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
For women travellers: it is recommended that all women declare that they are married, regardless of their actual civil status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassment, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Have the strength to refuse men, and don't be afraid to oppose them (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; under the name of Anfa, it was a strategically important port used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it with the name Casa Branca, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city, which was called Daru l-Badya, then called Casablanca by Spanish traders who chose these places for their commercial bases.
Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
In the surroundings of the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and lots of trinkets, but all this is reserved only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying much of the city's roads, especially those in the centre.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is advisable to do your research before undertaking any visits outside of Goma, so as to assess the state of the ongoing clashes in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the climb up the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the less expensive opportunities to see the mountain gorillas of Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around in Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
As a result of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today Timbuktu is a decaying city, but its reputation remains a tourist attraction, and it even has an airport.
In 1990 it was placed on the list of UNESCO World Heritage sites that are in danger, due to the threat posed by the desert sands.
It was a major stop on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World."
With its more Arab than African feel, the city is distinct from the rest of the country.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and stretches east along the border with Mozambique, to the north it borders Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
With an area of 19,500 km², the park includes 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different wildlife population.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the most important of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, daily conservation fees and park entry fees apply.
Buying a Wild Card could also be useful, as it allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong, which gives its name to the entire territory, is the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings that form the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a sparkling bar chart, even more evident because framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the waterfront of Kowloon opposite.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development has been concentrated on the reclaimed land of the densely populated northern coast.
This is the place that the English colonizers chose for themselves, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this land, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast in Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest included in Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, forests are not only made up of mangrove swamps: they also contain what remains of the impressive jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about a third is made up of marshy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for wildlife; it is estimated that there are 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the Inter District Bus Station (across the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang) depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the buses that run between different districts are often full, it is a good idea to buy your ticket a few days in advance.
Most neighborhoods are served by convenient and sturdy little Japanese buses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby locations, including Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque in Brazil to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two pylons are 83 metres high, it is 378 metres long and has two lanes 3.50 metres wide.
Under the bridge, the free vertical space is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was only opened to traffic in March 2017.
In September 2017, when Brazil's customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge should be fully operational.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group living in present-day eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and the Payaguá, who lived off hunting, gathering and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The Great Province of the Indies," was born in the 16th century from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its indigenous identity and character.
Everyone knows that Argentina has one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the most important tournament of the year takes place in the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Here you can watch minor tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and tickets for polo matches, contact the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The Falklands have their own official currency, the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to the British Pound (GBP).
The only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite FIC West, offers currency exchange services.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley you can often pay with credit cards and US dollars.
It is likely that credit cards will not be accepted on the outlying islands, although British and US currency may be accepted. Check with the owners in advance to decide on an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so change your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months, temperatures over 30°C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the feeling of a temperature lower than that marked by the thermometer.
There are no defined "dry" and "rainy" seasons: the amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials recommend keeping a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife.
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, elk, deer, bears, virtually all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured for not keeping a safe distance. It is necessary to leave these animals with enough space as they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Also, be aware that odors can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking food with strong odors, and try to keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This port was the site of the infamous naval blockade of 1889, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the independence struggle organised by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the town led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the paramount chief.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is located between two harbors. The most popular ones are divided into three areas.
The Pacific Ocean beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are mainly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, the stylish suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook the Waitemata Harbour.
These are family-friendly beaches that can get a bit crowded at times, surrounded by a wide range of shops. It is safe to swim here.
The most well-known local beer is a simple, pleasant and refreshing beer called "Number One". The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can get a lot of French wines, but the Australian and New Zealand ones might handle the journey better.
The tap water in the place is totally safe to drink, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
According to the Australians, the 'flat white' coffee comes from a foreign idea. The 'espresso' is a black short coffee, the cappuccino is covered in cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is on par with Belgian hot chocolate. The fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Throughout the year there are many coral reef tours and injuries from these causes on the reef are rare.
Always ask the authorities for advice, follow their instructions and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear from October to April near the beaches and river estuaries north of Seventeen Seventy, and are only occasionally seen outside of this period.
Sharks are present, but rarely attack humans. Most sharks fear humans and tend to keep their distance.
The habitat of saltwater crocodiles is mainly the river estuaries north of Rockhampton, not actively living in the ocean.
By booking in advance, the traveller has the peace of mind of finding a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with certain hotels, but it is also possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages that include breakfast, transfers to and from the airport, or even flight + hotel packages.
They can also hold the booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or to get additional documents required for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests must be made to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, most attendees choose to camp on site, considering this an essential part of the experience.
To be close to the action, you need to arrive early and claim a spot near the music.
Remember that once the music is over on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival where the music goes on until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as crossing ice causes quite a lot of noise, which is more noticeable for those who are more exposed to it.
St. Petersburg cruises include time to explore the city, and cruise passengers are granted visa-free entry (conditions apply).
Generally, casinos go to great lengths to maximize the amount of time and money their guests spend. There are usually no windows, no clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer exclusive food, drinks and entertainment to keep the mood of the guests high and make them stay.
In some places, alcoholic drinks are offered by the house. However, the state of drunkenness alters the ability to judge and every good gambler knows how important it is to remain sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or near-freezing temperatures.
On icy and snow-covered roads, the friction is reduced and it is not possible to drive as when on clean asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you can get stuck.
Rain, snow squalls, or the formation of ice or condensation on the vehicle's windows can also reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably Africa's biggest tourist draw and the centerpiece of many visitors' vacations.
In popular usage, the term safari refers to land-based travel, particularly in the savannah, to see Africa's beautiful wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to the car, so normal equipment is enough to get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and can be better observed with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "walking safari", or "foot safari") is an excursion that can last a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2012, and some of the events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two summer Olympic Games, the first of which was held in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, however, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
The cost of most of the event tickets is expected to be between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, while regular tickets will cost around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry faster. Many hotels offer the use of an iron and ironing board, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if you have one.
Be careful not to expose the fabric to too high temperatures, to avoid shrinkage or, in the worst case, burns.
There are various ways to sanitize water, and some of these are more effective against specific risks.
In some areas, boiling the water for one minute is sufficient, while in others it may take several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters is variable, so if in doubt, it is advisable to consider purchasing bottled water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travellers may come into contact with animal parasites that are not common in their home regions.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, as well as transmit poison or infections.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with force are not usually qualified as harmful animals.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy products that are exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travellers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The Buffalo-Pittsburgh stretch of highway between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most challenging to drive on, as it often cuts through isolated areas amid vegetation.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, it is advisable to keep your eyes open, as steep gradients, narrow roads and tight bends predominate.
The speed limits posted are significantly lower than those on the preceding and succeeding sections (usually 35-40 mph/56-64 km/h). Strict adherence to these limits is extremely important.
Oddly, though, cellphone coverage in this area is much better than in other parts of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite tasty and varied, similar to those of the neighboring Austria to the south.
Fruit desserts are a timeless classic, from apple-based ones available all year round to cherry and plum ones that make their appearance during the summer.
Several German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. The most popular cakes often pair well with a cup of strong coffee.
Those who want to try some small but flavourful cakes can opt for those that, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid it contains.
In northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used for curries in the interior regions; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more commonly used.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a broad term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without further qualification, the term generally refers to foods originating in the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a series of dishes that are easy to prepare; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet and are attached to the two sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can present safety issues due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting trapped.
If a jockey is thrown from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged by the escaping horse. To minimise this risk, there are some safety measures that can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather thin sole.
Later, some saddles, especially English ones, have included safety bars, which cause a leather bracket to detach from the saddle when, in the event of a fall, the rider pulls it back.
Cochamó Valley: the most important climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, where a large number of huge granite walls and cliffs can be found.
The peaks of the summits include breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world are constantly tracing new paths on its walls, potentially infinite.
Snow sports that involve sliding downhill on snow, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and has many enthusiasts, sometimes even called "ski bums" who devote entire vacation periods to skiing in a particular area.
The principle behind skiing is very old: the first cave paintings depicting humans skiing date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport has its origins at least in the 17th century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Ski touring: the activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski mountaineering or ski trekking.
It is related to, but usually not included in, ski touring or skimo, which are done on steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski run as a similar path to a hiking trail.
If conditions are good, you can cover somewhat more distance than you would walking, but only very rarely will you reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but made up of many independent countries. Normally, to travel through multiple countries, you would need to apply for a visa and go through passport control multiple times.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area functions more like a single country.
If you stay within this area, you can normally travel from one border to the other without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for individual country visas, saving you time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what makes an item an antique. Some tax agencies consider an item to be an antique if it is at least 100 years old.
The definition has geographic differences in the age limit, which can be lower, as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
Craft objects could be defined as antiques, even if they are more recent than similar mass-produced objects.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood for the Sámi and the culture on which this trade is based is also the basis for many other professions.
Even over time, not all Sámi have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding; some have lived off fishing, hunting and similar activities, using reindeer mainly as working animals.
Today, many Sami have modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami territory.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a misperception of Roma people.
If a travel warning is issued for your destination, it may affect your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
You might also be interested in the opinions of governments other than your own, but keep in mind that those opinions are aimed at the citizens of those governments.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The alerts are simply a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions expressed are often superficial, general and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Adverse weather conditions" is the general expression used to refer to any dangerous meteorological phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social inconvenience or loss of human life.
Extreme weather events can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of extreme weather events, depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hailstorms, above-average precipitation and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similarly to thunderstorms, tornadoes, marine whirlwinds and cyclones.
Among the regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena are thunderstorms, snowstorms, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travellers are advised to check the weather conditions in their area, as they may affect travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could potentially be considered a war zone must undergo professional training.
If you search the internet for 'hostile environment course' you are likely to find the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing games, as well as many training activities on first aid and sometimes on weapons.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in nature are widespread, while there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Travellers who plan to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they have valid travel documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without sex (X) designations or updated documents to match a desired name and gender is variable.
Equally variable is the willingness of foreign governments to accept such documents.
Even inspections at security checkpoints have become much more thorough in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Pre-operative transgender people should not have to expect to pass through security checks without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves breaking on the beach, often near a coral reef or similar formation.
Given the submarine topography, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current towards the open sea can form.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion while trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you are out of the current, swimming back will not be more difficult than normal.
Try to find an area where you won't get trapped again, or consider waiting for rescue, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted.
Reverse culture shock manifests itself in a shorter time than cultural shock (since there is a shorter "honeymoon" phase), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travellers who found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it difficult to readjust to the culture of their home country.
When you return home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the customs of your home culture.
In your first experience abroad, you are likely to have encountered patient and understanding people, who are aware that travellers in a new country need to adapt.
Many people did not imagine that patience and awareness were necessary even for those returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is the most interesting thing in the area for children.
Before the show begins, you can admire the pyramids in the dark and silence.
Normally you always hear the noise caused by tourists and vendors. The spectacle of sounds and lights is just like a book of stories.
The Sphinx becomes the background and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by various countries, the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the largest number of bases, of which sixteen were active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among the other islands are Livingston Island and Deception; in the latter, the caldera of a still active volcano filled with water has given rise to a magnificent natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the region that lies south of the peninsula and overlooks the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then re-emerge to form the Ellsworth Mountains, a 360 km long range cut in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Range, boasts the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas with no cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only viable alternative.
A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a cell phone, because you have to be outside with a clear view of the sky to make a call.
The service is often used by recreational craft, including yachts, as well as by missions that require remote data and voice.
Your local phone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
One of the increasingly popular options for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly popular among fresh graduates, as they can take a year off before starting university without compromising their education.
In many cases, taking a course abroad during a gap year can actually increase the chances of resuming higher education upon returning to one's home country.
Usually, enrollment in these educational programs requires payment of a fee.
Finland is an ideal destination for boating enthusiasts. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, both within the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht for archipelagos and lakes.
While the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly vast enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is also the case in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in general it is a rather unique phenomenon (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one to forty).
Many of the different Baltic cruises include a multi-day stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that it is possible to visit the historic town for two whole days, returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.
For the landing on land a separate visa will not be required (from 2009) using the onboard excursions.
Some brochures also offer cruises to Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be scary for people of all ages and conditions, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not dissimilar to the fears and personal aversions that many people have towards other things.
For some people, understanding a bit about how planes work and what happens during a flight can be helpful in overcoming a fear based on the unknown or a lack of control.
Courier services are well paid to deliver products quickly. Often, timing is very important in the case of business documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
For some routes the larger companies use their own planes, but for other routes and for smaller companies there were problems.
On some routes, air shipments would have taken days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to get it there faster would be to send it as checked baggage, and that's where you come in, since airline regulations don't allow for baggage to be sent without a passenger.
To fly first or business class, the obvious way is to shell out a pretty penny for the privilege (or, better still, persuade your company to do so).
However, the price to pay is high: you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class travel and up to eleven times the fare for first class travel!
In general, on direct flights from A to B, it is not even worth looking for discounts on first or business class seats.
Airlines know that there is a category of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably at their destination, and as a result, they apply certain rates.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău and the local language is Romanian. However, Russian is also very common.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has been the scene of ethnic conflict in the past.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistria Republic in the eastern part of Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two regions of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is Christian Orthodox.
Izmir is Turkey's third-largest city, with a population of around 3.7 million; it is the second-largest port after Istanbul and an important transportation hub.
The ancient city of Izmir is built on a huge bay, surrounded by mountains and is now a modern, developed and active commercial center.
Although the city has an atmosphere more like that of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey, the wide avenues, buildings with glass facades and modern shopping centres are dotted with the characteristic red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market and ancient mosques and churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and visit a unique octagonal church.
In the churchyard, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
Half an hour is enough to walk around the charming village.
To the north is the romantic and enchanting city of Sintra, easily accessible. It became famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to the brilliant account of its splendours written by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb 403 bus line regularly connects with Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north, visit the large sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (place of worship), a place of famous Marian apparitions throughout the world.
Remember that the site you are visiting is essentially a mass grave, and has almost incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived these places, and many others who saw their loved ones murdered or worked to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Avoid jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Avoid defacing these places by tagging or graffiti.
In the city of Barcelona, the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority is able to understand it; Spanish is known by practically everyone.
However, most signs are written exclusively in Catalan, which is by law the first official language.
Spanish, however, is widely used for public transport and other services.
On the metro, the regular announcements are only in Catalan. Any unscheduled service interruptions are communicated in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese, thanks to an automatic system.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and arrogant.
Even if it is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is to behave at your best, relating to people as a "bien élevé" (well-educated) person. This will definitely facilitate your movements.
The rough Parisian exterior will quickly fade away if you show off some basic good manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is rich in forests, mainly of beech, spruce and fir trees, and is characterised by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a multiplicity of microclimates, different soils and altitude levels, it presents a great variety of plant communities.
The area is also home to a huge variety of animal and bird species.
Rare species such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and grouse live in these places, alongside several other more widespread animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and to cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries have stoles available for women who arrive unprepared, but if you have one already, especially if it's brightly coloured, you'll earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long pants that go all the way down to their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the wardrobe at the entrance; however, the clothes are not washed after every user, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. For men, one size fits all!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
Pa amb Oli is a simple, popular dinner, typical of the summer season: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the condiments available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the pronoun "Sie" used for the polite form of "you," always begin with a capital letter, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
This probably also makes reading easier, although the need to understand whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantivised form makes the writing quite complex.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy since most words are pronounced as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation changes depending on the vowel that follows.
Also make sure you pronounce the "r" and "rr" differently: caro means beloved, while carro means carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar manual could help you a lot with Persian grammar and sentence comprehension.
It goes without saying that if you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with a minimal knowledge of Spanish may jump to the hasty conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore need not be studied separately.
Nowadays, pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete and serve as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution was not a problem in their heyday as it is today, they are usually located in cities or campuses, which are more accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge structures in remote locations where the atmospheric conditions are favourable.
The admiration of the cherry blossom, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where the blossoming of plums was preferred.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy close to the imperial court.
Plants do best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "just" one specimen.
If you visit an Italian garden, even picking a few plants will cost you a ban from the site, no discussion.
In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy city to get around; you can buy pretty much anything once you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics", just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with the heat (always) and the strong sun (more rarely, when the sky is clear).
Some buses also head north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the Bible's patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and their wives.
Make sure the bus you want to take goes into Hebron and doesn't stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great theme around which to organise a holiday.
For example, you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, you can take a cruise to visit the interesting cities of the Danube or you can sail on the Erie Canal.
They also define the routes of very well-known hiking trails and cycle paths.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals in Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
One tradition is to spend the night of Easter staying awake in an open place in order to admire the dawn.
There are of course Christian theological explanations behind this tradition, but it could just as well be a pre-Christian ritual linked to spring and fertility.
In more traditional churches, a Easter Vigil is often held on the Saturday night of the Easter weekend, with congregations often starting the ceremony at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands got there by swimming, flying or floating.
Because the distance from the mainland was considerable, mammals could not make the journey, which meant that the giant tortoise became the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Numerous mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs and cats were introduced to the Galapagos after the arrival of man.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic territories during winter, you will be able to experience the polar night, when the sun remains below the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the possibility to witness the Northern Lights, because the sky remains dark almost all day long.
Since the territories are sparsely populated, light pollution is often not a problem and you can enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners tend to be accustomed to.
Office attire usually consists of a jacket and tie or a suit, and colleagues are addressed by their surname or professional title.
The harmony of the workplace is of crucial importance, as it emphasizes the commitment of the group rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to get approval from their superiors for every decision, and are expected to follow instructions without asking questions.
