In the PALM study, ZMapp was used as a control, meaning scientists used it as a reference and compared it to the other three therapies.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes the absolute necessity for the Olympic community to work to create a safe environment for all its athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, can be better served by driving significant change within our organization, rather than by decertification.
USA Gymnastics has launched an independent investigation to understand how it was possible that an abuse of the size described with so much courage by those who managed to survive Larry Nassar could have remained hidden for so long, and is willing to implement any necessary or appropriate changes.

This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely accepted, but provides more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was brownish-grey on top, with a pale or carotenoid coloration on the bottom.
The discovery also allows for detailed information about the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the dinosaur's plumage is not endowed with the basic structure, the so-called rachis, but instead has other features typical of feathers, barbs and barbules, the researchers concluded that the rachis is probably the result of an evolutionary development subsequent to these characteristics.
The structure of the plumage suggests that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or courtship. Researchers hypothesize that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not a downy chick's plumage.
According to the researchers' hypotheses, despite the tail belonging to a young dinosaur, the sample reveals a plumage from an adult specimen and not that of a chick.

The work carried out was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the actual surveys of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect sought by the team was to be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts an attractive force on the Earth that generates tides, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to deduce that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same effects that "normal" matter has.
This theory suggests that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is collected in a kind of halo, formed by a multitude of small particles.

Dr Tony Moll has identified extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal.
According to a statement released in an interview, this new variant was "highly concerning and alarming, due to the high mortality rate."
According to Dr. Moll, some patients may have contracted the microbe within the hospital, and at least two of them were healthcare workers at the hospital itself.

Infrared images show thermal oscillations between day and night, demonstrating that they are probably caves.
During the day they are cooler than the surrounding surface and at night they are warmer.
Glen Cushing of the astrogeology team at the US Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona, said: "Their thermal behavior is not as constant as that of large terrestrial caves, which often maintain a relatively stable temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground."
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters enter an isolated booth and put a pre-printed sheet into an envelope indicating their chosen candidate.
After the officials verify his identity, the voter deposits the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral register.

Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers can testify that there are no envelopes present at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added to those of the voters, duly counted and authorized.
Candidates can send their representatives to attend every stage of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, in accordance with specific procedures.

The victims were Nicholas Alden, 25, and the driver, Zachary Cuddeback, 21.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider will undergo surgery to reconstruct his face.
Uka's weapon did not explode when it was pointed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider has constant pain, is blind in one eye, has a section of his skull missing and his face has been reconstructed in titanium.
Schneider testified via videoconference from a USAF base in his country.
In addition to the event on Wednesday, Carpanedo participated in two individual races of the Championships.
The first in the slalom, where in the first run he recorded a DNT. Another 36 competitors out of 116 in the same race did not finish the race.
The other race in which she participated, the giant slalom, saw her finish tenth in the women's "seated" category, with a combined time of 4:41.30, more than 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-placed Austrian Claudia Loesch, and more than 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-placed Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four female skiers in the women's group were unable to finish their runs, and 45 of the 117 participants in the Giant Slalom did not qualify for the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police managed to recover the laptop and the cell phone that had been stolen.
The Deputy Inspector General, DK Arya, announced: "Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman. We have also found her cell phone and her laptop."
The names of the defendants are: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to the superintendent of the police Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
None of the three people who were in the house at the time of the car crash were injured.
Despite this, the driver was seriously injured to the head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed, while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
From that moment, Adekoya is at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the accusation of having killed his own son.
She is being held in custody pending trial and sentencing, but any testimony given by an eyewitness could be tainted, as her image has been widely published.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice has different parameters. Scottish courts have deemed the publication of the photos potentially prejudicial.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee, "journalists who publish photos or other material of suspicious subjects are walking on a minefield."
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for legal proceedings, has told journalists that no further comment will be made until the formal charge is made.
According to leaks, the document will address the dispute over borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East War.
According to what is said, the other topics covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to abandon such a presence only for five years.
The shooters within the experimental program for the control of harmful animals had to be carefully monitored by the rangers, since the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association, the NPWS, in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., has recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the Park Conservation and Heritage of the NPWS, the four shooters chosen for the first shooting operation have received comprehensive training and safety instructions.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
This is the fifth provisional electoral council of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission proposed a package of measures aimed at pushing the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP.
The commission has constituted Martelly's response to the widespread protests, which began in October, that contest the regime.
The occasional violent protests have been triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were scheduled as early as 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of malfunctioning iPods have been reported, which have caused a total of six fires and caused minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has stated that it is aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of another 34 incidents related to overheating, which the company described as "not serious".
In its response, the ministry called Apple's delay of the report "absolutely deplorable."
The earthquake in the Mariana Islands was felt at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office, no damage has been reported in the nation.
And the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no signs of a tsunami in progress.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino policeman took hostage some Hong Kong tourists after hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle, Rolando Mendoza fired on the tourists.
Many of the hostages have been saved, at least six have died.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were immediately released along with the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was fatally struck.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
After training in obstetrics, she joined the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While serving at the hospital, in his free time Liggins began to study cases of premature labor.
His research showed that the administration of a hormone would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two "black boxes" with flight recordings.
Even his fellow wrestlers wanted to pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, just like her. A strong woman."
"Luna was as crazy as me... Maybe even more... I love her and I will miss her... Let's hope she is in a better place," was the comment of Dustin "Goldust" Runnels.
According to a survey of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal elections, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% from 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, the acting prime minister, Julia Gillard, stated that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
This opinion is shared by 34% of survey participants, who believe that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
At the other end of the survey, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe it should never become one.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to compete in the 100 and 200 meter freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but suffered from several ailments that led to doubts about her physical condition.
He was not able to take the necessary medication to overcome the pain because it is banned from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date.
The discovery was verified by several people through the use of various hardware and software at the beginning of February, and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been one of the sources that brought water and organic matter to Earth, i.e. matter capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form and in particular how the Earth formed, having collided with comets a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, has been in office since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he signed a law that makes same-sex marriage legal.
According to him, speculation is nothing but "chatter and political idiocy".
A candidacy for the presidency in 2016 is being considered.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow planes to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year, thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system uses satellite technology instead of the outdated ground-based radar technology, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being set up and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, while there are no car parks or interchange parking available on site.
Fears about the lack of transport have led to the possibility of the match being played behind closed doors, without the support of the team's fans.
According to a study published Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of bird has been born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers from Princeton University, United States, and Uppsala University, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that the time required for this process was much longer; this was due to mating between a Darwin's endemic finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into any shape. It can be rolled to create tiny shapes.
It can be pulled until it forms a thin wire, suitable for being twisted and intertwined. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. Sometimes it has been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts" precisely because of its ability to be made so thin.
This is the so-called pH of the substance. Using red cabbage juice, it is possible to build a pH indicator.
The color of the cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
The pH level of the chemical substance analyzed is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the pH letter H).
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been stripped (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dried powders together and then, with clean and wet hands, roll them into a ball.
Between the moisture on your hands and the outer layers, a reaction will occur that will cause a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
Almost all the houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with running water connected to an advanced sewage system.
In Greece, in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, remains of sewage systems have been discovered.
In ancient times, toilets also existed in Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, they were sometimes included in public baths, frequented by a mixed public of men and women.
To call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space using a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and vision.
A rocket more than 100 feet tall is needed to transport a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has greatly changed the world. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important one is that it has provided us with simpler and faster transportation.
Thanks to his invention, the train, the automobile, and several other means of transportation appeared.
Below them are other medium-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including feral domestic cats) that feed on much more numerous small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The concept of niche is the secret of their success, a particular goal that every feline has and that allows them not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats and live in large groups called prides.
The packs are made up of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and cubs that can reach 30.
Usually the females are closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The lion pack acts in a way very similar to the wolf or dog pack, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not that of other big cats), even as far as deadly attacks on their prey are concerned.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (albeit not very well), swim, make very long jumps and exert a pulling force five times greater than that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the Panthera genus) as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar. These four felines are the only ones to roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as that of the lion, but it is more like a sentence of shouted and angry words.
Ocelots love to feed on small animals. If possible, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the prey they catch is much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that the ocelots follow and find their prey thanks to their sense of smell, sniffing the ground where they have been.
Thanks to their night vision, they are able to see very well in the dark, as well as being able to move stealthily. To hunt their prey, the ocelots blend in with their surroundings before pouncing on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population to which it belongs (for example, if it moves beyond a mountain range or a river, or moves to a new island, making a possible return difficult), it will likely find itself in an environment different from the one it was in before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, so, in order to position itself as a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations than those needed previously.
The original population has not changed at all; it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists of the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and is a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide expelled by humans (through exhalation).
Plants process their own nutrition with the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and produce our clothes from plants. Much of the food we eat is made from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its era and therefore feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
From its long jaws, more than 70 razor-sharp teeth protruded, plus an additional row located on the palate, so that anyone who crossed its path was doomed.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that it had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it's also possible that it was a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex couldn't compete with him.
Although much of their food would appear familiar to us, Roman banquets also included various strange or unusual dishes, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a ghiro.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate while sitting on chairs, the rich men loved to feast together while lying on their sides while consuming their meal.
Of course, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include various foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each deity, which was considered the abode of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to provide for the needs of the deities through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built, which became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
Thanks to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, the house was not of fundamental importance.
Much of the Jewish family's life took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard, while the shops were simple open-air stalls that faced the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas it is said that it was Erik the Red who gave it its name, having encountered Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But, regardless of its discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although all countries are "Scandinavian", the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you have seen the movie "The Mystery of the Templars", you might think that a treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is false. Even if there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence the large parchment document (measuring 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Therefore, the annotation was probably just added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the fighting that followed had brought the north of France to liberation, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the Vichy regime, that is, by those French who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and had allied with the invaders, instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France: this offensive operation was called "Operation Dragoon".
The American and Free French forces had liberated the south of France in just two weeks and were heading towards Germany.
Civilization refers to a specific culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, forming a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis", which means civil; the term is in turn connected with "civis", that is, citizen, and "civitas", that is, city or city-state, and in a certain way therefore also defines the dimensions of society.
City-states are the first entities to anticipate the idea of a nation. The culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge through multiple generations, leaving an indelible cultural imprint through fair distribution.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving any significant historical traces, and are therefore not recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states formed a weak central government for the first time, and the Congress was its only component, according to the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes and, given the absence of an executive or judicial power at the national level, it relied on the state authorities, often uncooperative, for the application of its own acts.
He didn't even have the authority to bypass tax laws and tariffs between states.
To amend the articles, the unanimous consent of all states was necessary. These, for their part, had so little regard for the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German team, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
The most popular sports are: football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, track cycling and Formula 1 car races.
Winter sports are more widespread in the northern regions and see Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
The Japanese archipelago includes almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
From a geographical point of view, Japan is referred to as an "archipelago", considering the presence of groups of islands that make it up.
Taiwan was born in the 15th century, when European sailors passing through soon recorded the name of the island with the name of Ilha Formosa, or wonderful island.
The Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest part of Taiwan in 1624, initiating a transformation that involved the indigenous people's cereal production systems and hiring Chinese laborers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan came under the control of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the first Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, thus ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan; the island remained under Japanese rule until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Much of the peripheral buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30% of the Machu Picchu site had been recovered, but restoration work is still ongoing.
The most common format in the world for still image photography, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the most commonly used film at the end of the era of analog photography.
It is still produced today and, more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strangely, the height of the 35 mm format is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest ratio of whole numbers) are therefore considered 3:2.
The proportions of many of the common formats (for example the APS format family) are equal to or very close to this value.
The much-abused and often derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective place to position the main subject corresponds to the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
At this stage in European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, found itself under scrutiny.
Christian religion had acted as a glue between European states for over a thousand years, despite linguistic and cultural differences.
Its omnipresent power has influenced everyone, from the king to the common citizens.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary reserves exist precisely for this reason.
The central authority of the church has remained in Rome for over a thousand years and this convergence of power and money has led many to wonder if this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective: it involved the interruption of any essential military and civilian supplies, despite this blockade violating international law, which is usually accepted and codified by multiple international treaties over the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any vessel from accessing entire sections of the ocean, putting even neutral ships at risk.
Since this tactic had elicited a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its indiscriminate submarine warfare campaign.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer at the Edison Company in New York City, which led him to move to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his supervisor in his previous job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different periods of time were indicated in a very unique way: every period of China or every family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
The intervals between the individual dynasties were also characterized by periods of instability and division between the provinces. The most well-known was the so-called Three Kingdoms period, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
During these periods, fierce wars broke out among many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent eras in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting for a place of honor in the imposing palace of Xi'an.
The social and political effects are numerous, among these we can mention the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to the republic, nationalism and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and is not the property of a single monarch.
Furthermore, after the Revolution, professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same applies to the military, since the army rankings are now based on caliber instead of class.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers from various countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, offers a very clear image of the spirituality of Muhammad in itself.
The cave sits atop one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely detached from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find, even if you know it exists. Once inside the cave, isolation is total.
There is nothing else to see but a beautiful clear sky and a large amount of mountains around. From the inside of the cave, you can see or hear very little of the surrounding world.
Among the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one that has survived to this day.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramidal structures built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, is home to numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), various smaller tombs, various temples, and the great Sphinx.
The important pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Cheope, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the pharaoh's wives and family members.
The "arcata in su" indication resembles a V and the "arcata in giù" indication resembles a staple or a square without the bottom side.
Up means you should start from the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start from the alamaro (which is where the hand supports the bow) and pull the bow towards you.
An ascending bow usually generates a softer sound, while a descending bow results in a stronger and more decisive sound.
You can decide to add your own custom markings to the pencil, but keep in mind that the archery marks you find printed have a musical value, so they should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of market women forced King Louis XVI, in a state of terror, to leave Versailles and return to Paris, along with Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Maria Teresa, 11 years old, and Louis Charles, 4 years old) and Elizabeth, the king's sister.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and screamed threats against the monarchs.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed in Versailles.
The war expenses of US imperialism to conquer the Philippines have been paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover a large part of the expenses and the interest on the bonds fluctuated in the name of the Philippine government through the banking institutions of Wall Street.
Clearly, the enormous profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people formed the basis of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history that covers the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (from 1000 to 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or the technological imperative to the strict sense according to which the fate of man is moved by an underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Much of the interpretation of technological determinism has two general ideas in common: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology has its own "effects" on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the automobile necessarily involves the development of the road network.
However, a national road network for just a few cars is not economically sustainable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs associated with owning a car.
The mass possession of automobiles also leads to a higher percentage of accidents on the roads, and consequently the invention of new rescue techniques for the care of injured people.
Romanticism was characterized by a consistent component of cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography has conditioned individuals, and over time, customs, costumes, and culture related to this geography have emerged that, being in harmony with the context of society, have proven to be more effective than laws imposed arbitrarily.
Like Paris, now known as the capital of contemporary fashion, Constantinople was the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
Its notoriety as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until approximately 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century, its prestige declined, especially because the crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of the Gothic style was reached in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the east.
But the slowness of communication channels means that the spread of styles in the West can be delayed by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the time, resulting from the Crusades, was the introduction of buttons for fastening clothes.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence when it is practiced solely for the purpose of producing enough to meet the food needs of the farmer/farmer's family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, usually organic, that uses seeds native to the ecological region in association with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at getting the most out of the harvest.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and in many developing countries it still is.
Subcultures unite individuals with the same opinions, who do not feel represented by the standards of society, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished based on the age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Often, members of a subculture indicate their membership through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, manners, and slang.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyze some unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, following misfortunes, or as a result of intentional abuse, grew up without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "feral" or wild. Some of them have been segregated by people (often their own parents): in some cases, abandonment is motivated by the refusal of a serious intellectual or physical disability by the parents.
Feral children may have suffered serious violence or trauma before abandonment or flight.
Other children may have been raised by animals; still others seem to have lived alone in the wild.
When the feral child is fully raised by non-human animals, it shows behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely analogous to those of the particular animal that has taken care of it, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Project-based learning should make learning itself simpler and more interesting, while scaffolding goes a bit further.
Scaffolding is not a mode of learning, but rather a help for those who undertake a new learning experience, such as the use of a new computer program or the start of a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "scaffolding", but so is the little staple-shaped assistant in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are designed to query, prompt, and explain procedures that the student may have difficulty managing on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, if not even extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that does not guarantee him nourishment, care and education, but that is what happens to them.
We believe that foster care represents a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education, and reliable health care.
It is assumed that the foster care will meet all the needs not met in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the theory of uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord's (1998) study of audience reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships".
The use of video recording has allowed significant discoveries to be made in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that it is possible to discover whether a person is lying by interpreting micro-expressions correctly.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks explained how people who are unable to understand spoken language due to brain damage are still able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that these skills in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research has shown the existence of two pools of genetic variability, namely hidden variability and expressed variability.
With mutation, new genetic variability is added, and with selection, it is eliminated from the pool of expressed variability.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute variability back and forth between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to meet their amino acid needs with the plant resources available in the savannah.
Furthermore, the failure to carry out these activities has serious consequences: slowed growth, malnutrition, and, ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us they are difficult to digest, unless they are cooked.
Animal foods, on the other hand (such as ants, termites, and eggs), are not only easy to digest, but they provide a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
In light of all this, it should come as no surprise that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a sense similar to how savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the intentional process of waking up during the normal sleep period, followed by a resumption of sleep (10–60 minutes later).
This process can be easily practiced using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you into a state of consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you decide to reset the clock while sleeping, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you will be forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options focused on the biorhythm involve consuming a lot of fluids before bed (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which forces you to get up to urinate.
A person enjoys inner peace in proportion to the tension existing in his body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force is. Every one of us has the potential ability to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. This goal is only hindered by our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been enriched by the path of love of the Mahayana ritual and by various techniques of Indian yoga.
In general, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It is based on Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and a path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini Yoga activates the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) through the use of yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the core of Tibetan meditation. By visualizing various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is developed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to collaboration between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, systemic, procedural, and cultural conflicts caused a rift between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the allies of the past had become enemies; the Cold War began.
It would have lasted for the next 40 years and would have been fought for real, by mercenary armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other countries.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been breached; the only option was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans proved to be immediately obsolete, however, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Using ships for the transport of goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the navy has always been to ensure that the country safeguards its ability to move people and goods, while at the same time countering the ability of the enemy to move their people and goods.
One of the recent examples in support of this theory and most noteworthy is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. During the battle, the Americans tried to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to support Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, tried to disrupt this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have had the opportunity to conquer Great Britain, just as it had done in the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains, Iran.
They were bred by ancient cultures and tribes to have milk, wool, meat and skin readily available.
Domestic goats were usually raised in herds allowed to roam the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by herdsmen (similar to shepherds) who were often children or teenagers. These methods of pastoralism are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although they were simply made up of parallel wooden planks, the wagonways, compared to the slightly more rugged roads of the time, allowed horses to travel at greater speeds and carry heavier loads.
The sleepers were introduced relatively early to keep the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they had a bar of iron on top.
It became a common practice, although the iron caused greater wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Finally, wooden wheels gave way to iron ones. In 1767, the first completely iron rails appeared.
The first means of transport that man has known are his legs. Humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means "upright man").
Its predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not habitually walk upright.
Signs of bipedalism are present in Australopithecus fossils dating back to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate the future suffering to some extent, we can start to adopt more environmentally friendly lifestyles, we can join the environmental movement and also do activism.
In many cases, this only works as a symptomatic treatment. If we want a permanent solution, however, we must find the root cause of the problem and eliminate it.
It is quite clear that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of humanity, while the problems have increased due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humans.
After the Congress adopted it on July 4, a manuscript draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printing shop a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were produced that night, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides".
The document was first read publicly on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall and the task was entrusted to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops stationed in New York on July 9, while a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 known drafts of Dunlap's are the oldest existing copies of the document. The original manuscript is lost.
According to many paleontologists today, a category of dinosaurs survived and is still alive. They are the ones we call birds.
Many tend not to consider them dinosaurs because of their feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds have many characteristics that they share with dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they have scaly feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs.
In short, the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers is the basis of all computers currently in use.
A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and in computer science these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Its symptoms, including vomiting, are very general, making an immediate diagnosis impossible.
The main indication of internal poisoning could be the presence of an open container of medication or harmful chemicals in the home.
Check the label for first aid instructions related to that specific poison.
The term mite is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the familiarity in ancient times with bed bugs, insects that have strongly adapted to become parasites of humans.
Both bed bugs and assassin bugs are nesting, meaning they are adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States of America, multiple sclerosis (MS) affects about 400,000 people, making it the most common neurological disease affecting young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The research has highlighted that the chances of developing MS are twice as high in women as in men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child.
These couples have the option to choose an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the natural parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides most scientific inquiry.
But it is not just about experimentation, since an experiment is a test that is used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also allows you to guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's opinions on various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the gradual decline of the Greek language, the West was isolated from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior are determined by the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been documented, which are not just reactions to external periodic signals, in relation to most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was that conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, i.e. viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments highlighting the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a range of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the relevance of the piece of genetic material involved and whether the cells affected belong to the germ line.
Mutations that can be passed on to children are only those at the level of germ cells; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including flora and wild fauna.
Examples of activities to do on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visits to parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
For example, by visiting, photographing and getting to know the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small rural towns to drive to work, crossing paths with others whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic back and forth, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system based on private cars, which they also support.
Today, science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere outside of one of its conditions of stability that has allowed human evolution over the last two million years.
Every person participates in social life and uses transport systems, which almost everyone complains about.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about the quality of water or bridges falling into disrepair.
Why do transport systems attract so many complaints, why are they rejected every day? Are the engineers who design them incompetent, or are there deeper motivations?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, driver behavior tends to fall within a reasonably constant range, so in turn, traffic flows tend to show reasonable constancy and can be represented mathematically in a generic way.
To obtain a more accurate representation of the traffic flow, the three main variables have been correlated: (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for planning, designing and managing road structures.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. The ability to fly allowed them to escape their enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects are advantageous because they can fold their wings along their body.
This allows them to exploit a greater variety of small crevices to hide from predators.
Among all the insects that exist today, the only ones that are not able to fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the Sun.
Someone was right, but many others believed the opposite, that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and also the other stars), moved around the Earth.
Which seems sensible, because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on Earth. It carries 8 times the amount of water as the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river in the world, with a width that in some places reaches six miles.
20% of the total water that flows from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and is fed by the waters of thousands of smaller tributaries.
Stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in terms of their size and technical excellence.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom remained enchanted by admiring the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were much more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is made up of around 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the one with the smallest population.
The language of the Vatican City for legislation and official communications is Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most people working within the state, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
In the Vatican City, all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man began to know the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper already in ancient times: these elements can be found in nature in their native form and can be extracted quite easily with the help of primitive tools.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is made up of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
These in fact resemble more the four states of matter, namely (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma. However, he also theorized that they transformed into new substances, forming what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains numerous elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There can also be alloys composed of small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly small, so much so that trillions of them could fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
After its invention, the pencil has proved to be a good friend for many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and less widespread use.
Today, everyone writes messages on computer screens and never needs to approach a thermometer.
We can only wonder what fate the keyboard will have when something newer arrives.
The principle that energy is needed to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is the basis of the operation of the fission bomb.
In practice, it's like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. So, by further dividing the nucleus, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break apart in the presence of little or no pressure.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust, and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km on the farthest side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under mountainous areas.
The maria could be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner. This facilitated the rise of the lava to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what unites some people and pushes them to want to do what they do, and what are the factors of the context in which they live that push them to do or not do certain things.
Among the most popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, when managers start to manage their former colleagues, two behaviors can emerge. On the one hand, there are those who try to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
The manager of this type finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, to implement disciplinary actions, to evaluate performance, to define and assign responsibilities.
At the opposite extreme, the manager becomes a completely different person, who feels that he must change the entire work of the team and make it his own.
In the end, the leader is the person who is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often generates disagreements between leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence for virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with some small differences.
Members of the virtual team often serve as a point of contact for their next physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as meetings can take place according to various time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
The management team to which each member refers is called the "invisible team" and it is the one that establishes the standards for each member.
Why should an organization want to go through the long process of building an organization of learning? A good reason to implement the concepts of organizational learning may be innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized in all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the path of collaboration within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
For an organization to be considered innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates the theory of the continuum as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
The neurobiological results have demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. The research area becomes narrower and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is the basis of scientists' research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors can affect behavior and modify certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and brain processes that have never been observed before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Despite having a strong science fiction connotation, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research on AI includes the creation of machines to automate operations that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples of applications are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, as well as the recognition of writing, vocal and facial.
These things have become distinct disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as well as being integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are a fundamental part of education. Often, teachers would like to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution is offered by technology with virtual tours. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great excuse to share travel experiences and reflections with future classes.
For example, every year the students at Bennet School, North Carolina, design a website about their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Often, their first experiences with blogs are marked by poor grammar and spelling, but generally the presence of an audience changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative judgments the blog author is committed to improving writing.
Blogs also "force students to become more aware of the world around them." The need to engage the public motivates students to be creative and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop student learning well beyond the normal school day.
The correct use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their own position within the writings of others, as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming and bilingual capital of Canada, rich in art galleries and museums that tell the country's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and to the north you can admire the natural and unspoiled beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All of this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
The vast areas to the north are sparsely populated, some of which are almost uninhabited wildernesses.
If you compare the population, the result may be surprising for many: in the United States, the number of African American citizens is higher than that of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a continent in its own right.
Almost all the smaller islands, known as luxurious seaside resorts, are mostly independent nations or associated with France.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the islands, which began a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape Route, which goes from Europe to India, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama paved the way for European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, while to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
For female travelers: all are advised to declare themselves as married, regardless of their actual civil status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
It is appropriate for women to realize that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassment, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Have the courage to reject men, and do not be afraid to oppose them (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; under the name of Anfa, it was a port of strategic importance used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merinids.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it with the name of Casa Branca, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city, which was called Daru l-Badya, then called Casablanca by the Spanish traders who chose these places for their commercial bases.
Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and lots of souvenirs, but all of this is reserved only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying much of the city's streets, especially those in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is advisable to research well before making any visits outside of Goma, in order to assess the state of the clashes that still persist in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, in addition to being one of the least expensive opportunities to see the mountain gorillas of Africa.
It is possible to use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to move around in Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Also as a result of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuctù" has ended up becoming a metaphor for exotic and distant land.
Today, Timbuktu is a decayed city, but for its reputation it remains a tourist attraction, also equipped with an airport.
In 1990 it was included in the list of Unesco heritage sites that are in danger, due to the threat posed by the desert sands.
In Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World," it was one of the main stops.
With its more Arabic than African touch, the city stands out sharply from the others in the country.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and stretches east along the border with Mozambique, north with Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
With a surface area of 19,500 km², the park includes 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different wild fauna.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the most important of the South African national parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily conservation fees and entry fees to the park.
Purchasing a Wild Card may also be useful, as it allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
The Island of Hong Kong, which gives its name to the entire territory, is the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings that form the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a sparkling bar graph, even more evident because it is framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the Kowloon waterfront across the way.
Most of the urban development of Hong Kong Island has focused on reclaimed land on the densely populated north coast.
This is the place that the English colonizers chose for themselves, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this land, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove coastal belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast inland in Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest included in the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just made up of mangrove swamps: they also contain what remains of the impressive jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about a third is made up of marshy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for wild fauna; it is estimated that there are 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang) depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses between different districts are often full, it is best to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most neighborhoods are served by comfortable and sturdy Japanese minibuses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby locations, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a truss bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
Its two pylons are 83 meters high, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
Under the bridge, the free vertical space is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but the opening to traffic only took place in March 2017.
In September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge should be fully operational.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group living in present-day eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and the Payaguá, who lived off hunting, gathering and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century from the meeting between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
Since the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its identity and its native peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina boasts one of the best teams and best polo players in the world.
In December, the most important tournament of the year takes place in the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Here you can watch minor tournaments and matches at other times of the year too.
For information on tournaments and purchasing tickets for polo matches, please contact the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The Falklands have their own official currency, the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to the British pound (GBP).
The only bank on the islands, located in Stanley in front of the FIC West store, offers currency exchange services.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands. In Stanley, you can often pay with credit cards and US dollars.
It is likely that credit cards will not be accepted on the outlying islands, although British and US currencies may be accepted. Check with the owners in advance to decide on an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so change your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months temperatures above 30°C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the impression of a temperature lower than that indicated by the thermometer.
There are no defined "dry" and "rainy" seasons: the amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year.
Even if many of the park's animals are used to the sight of humans, the fauna is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities recommend keeping a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals.
No matter how docile they may seem: bison, moose, deer, bears, practically all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors suffer injuries for not maintaining an adequate distance. It is necessary to leave these animals an adequate space as they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Also, be aware that odors can attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking foods with very strong odors, and try to keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoa Islands. It is located on the island of Upolu and its population is just under 40,000.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In this port, the infamous naval standoff of 1889 occurred, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme chief.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is located between two ports. The most popular are divided into three areas.
The beaches facing the Pacific Ocean on the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are mainly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook Waitemata Harbour.
These are family-friendly beaches that can get a bit crowded, surrounded by a wide choice of shops. You can swim safely.
The most well-known local beer is a non-complex, pleasant and refreshing beer called "Number One". The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can have many French wines, but Australian and New Zealand wines could better withstand the journey.
The tap water is totally safe to drink, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
According to the Australians, the 'flat white' coffee was born from a foreign idea. The 'espresso' is a short black coffee, the cappuccino is covered with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is on par with Belgian chocolate. Fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Throughout the year, many excursions are made on the coral reef and accidents due to one of these causes on the coral reef are rare.
Always ask for advice from the authorities, follow their instructions and pay particular attention to safety notices.
Cubomedusae appear from October to April near the beaches and estuaries of the rivers north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside this period they can only be found occasionally.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks fear humans and tend to keep their distance.
The habitat of saltwater crocodiles is mainly made up of the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton, as they do not actively live in the ocean.
By booking in advance, the traveler has the peace of mind of finding a place to sleep once they reach their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with certain hotels, but it is still possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transfers to/from the airport or even combined flight+hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain additional documents necessary for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any changes or requests must be made to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
During some music festivals, most of the participants decide to camp on site, considering this aspect a crucial element of the experience.
To be close to the center of the action, you need to get there early and secure a spot near the music.
Remember that once the main stages are done, there may be sections of the festival where the music goes on until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the North Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice causes quite annoying noises for those who are most exposed to it.
St. Petersburg cruises include time for exploring the city. Cruise passengers are granted visa exemption (check conditions).
Generally, casinos do everything they can to increase the amount of time and money spent by their guests as much as possible. Typically, there are no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer food, drinks, and exclusive entertainment to keep the guests' spirits high and make them want to stay.
In some places, alcoholic drinks are offered by the house. However, intoxication alters judgment and every good gambler knows how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow, ice or temperatures close to zero.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is reduced and it is not possible to drive as well as on clean asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a short time that you can get stuck.
Even precipitation and snow squalls, or the formation of ice or condensation on the vehicle's windows, can reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the focus of many visitors' holidays.
In its popular use, the term safari refers to land-based trips, particularly in the savannah, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so normal equipment is sufficient to get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and for this reason it is possible to observe them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk", "hiking safari", or "walking safari") is an excursion that can last a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2012, and some of the events will take place in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games. The first Olympics took place in 1964.
If your booking for flights and accommodation for 2020 was made before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, however, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies do not go until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that the cost of most event tickets will be between 2,500 ¥ and 130,000 ¥, while regular tickets will cost around 7,000 ¥.
Ironing wet clothes can facilitate drying them. Many hotels offer the use of an iron and ironing board, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if you have one available.
Be careful not to expose the tissues to too high temperatures, to avoid shrinkage or, in the worst case, burns.
There are various ways to sanitize water and some of these are more effective against specific risks.
In some areas, it is sufficient to boil the water for a minute, in others it takes many minutes.
The effectiveness of filters is variable, so in case of doubts it is advisable to consider buying bottled water in sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travellers may come into contact with animal parasites that are not found in their home regions.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, as well as transmit poison or infections.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with force are not usually classified as harmful animals.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy tax-free and duty-free products in certain locations.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway between Point Marion and Fairmont is the one with the most difficult driving conditions, as it often passes through isolated areas among the vegetation.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, it is advisable to keep your eyes wide open, as steep slopes, narrow roads and sharp bends predominate.
The speed limits shown are considerably lower than those applied in the previous and subsequent sections (usually 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h). Their strict observance is extremely important.
Strangely, however, in this area the level of coverage of the mobile phone service is much higher than that present in other stretches of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite flavorful and varied, similar to those of neighboring Austria to the south.
Fruit desserts are a timeless classic, from those with apples available all year round to those with cherries and plums, which appear during the summer.
Several German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. The most popular cakes often go very well with a cup of strong coffee.
Those who want to taste small but flavorful sweets can opt for those that, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid it contains.
In northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is usually used for curries in the inland regions; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more commonly used.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found in the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term generally refers to foods originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island, Java.
The Javanese cuisine, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a series of dishes of simple preparation; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet and are attached to the two sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider but can present safety problems due to the possibility that the rider's feet may become trapped.
If a jockey is thrown off a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged along by the escaping horse. To minimize this risk, there are some safety measures that can be taken.
First of all, most knights wear riding boots with heels and a smooth, rather thin sole.
Later, some saddles, especially English ones, included safety bars, which cause a leather strap to detach from the saddle when, in the event of a fall, the rider pulls it back.
Cochamó Valley: the most important climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, where a large number of enormous granite walls and cliffs are found.
The peaks of the summits include breathtaking panoramas. Climbers from all over the world are constantly tracing new routes on its potentially infinite walls.
Downhill snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular and involve sliding on snow using skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and has many enthusiasts, sometimes even called "ski bums", who dedicate entire holiday periods to skiing in a particular area.
The principle behind skiing is very ancient: the first rock paintings depicting humans skiing date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport has its origins at least in the 17th century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by the Norwegians.
Ski touring: the activity is also called off-piste, ski mountaineering or trekking on skis.
It is connected, although usually not understood by them, to touring skiing or skimo, which are practiced on steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski slope as a hiking trail.
If conditions are good, you can cover distances somewhat greater than those covered by walking, but you will only rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it is made up of many independent countries. Normally, to travel through multiple countries, you would need to apply for a visa and go through passport control multiple times.
However, in this regard, the Schengen area functions more like a single country.
If you stay within this area, it is usually possible to go from one border to the other without having to go through passport controls again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual member countries, thus saving time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what makes an item an antique. Some tax agencies consider an item to be an antique if it is at least 100 years old.
The definition presents geographical differences compared to the age limit which can be lower, as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
Craft objects could be defined as antiques, even if they are more recent than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer husbandry is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi and the culture on which this trade is based is also the basis of many other professions.
Even over time, not all Sámi have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding; some lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer primarily as work animals.
Today, many Sámi people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi territory.
Even if it is very used, especially among non-Rom people, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a wrong perception of Roma people.
If a travel warning is issued for the destination you will be visiting, there could be consequences for your travel health insurance or your cancellation insurance.
You might also be interested in the opinions of governments other than your own, but keep in mind that these opinions are aimed at the citizens of those governments.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East might encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The alerts simply provide a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions reported are often superficial, general and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Adverse weather conditions" is the general expression used to indicate any dangerous meteorological phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur in every part of the world, and there are different types of them, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong wind gusts, hail, above-average precipitation, and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similar to thunderstorms, tornadoes, sea tornadoes, and cyclones.
Among the regional and seasonal weather phenomena of strong intensity are thunderstorms, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are advised to check the weather conditions in their area, as they could affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone must undergo professional training.
Searching the Internet for 'Course on hostile environments' is likely to find the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually using practical experience.
A standard course lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing games, as well as many first aid and sometimes weapons training activities.
Books and magazines about survival in the wild are widespread, while there are few publications that deal with war zones.
Travelers who plan to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should make sure they have valid documents for their return trip.
The intention of governments to issue passports without indications regarding sex (X) or updated documents to match a desired name and gender is variable.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept such documents is equally variable.
Even inspections of security checks have become much more thorough in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Transgender people in the pre-operative stage should not expect to pass through the controls without their privacy and dignity being affected.
Rip currents are formed by the backwash of waves that break on the beach, often near a coral reef or similar formations.
Given the submarine topography, the return flow concentrates in some deeper sections where a strong current can form towards the open sea.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion in trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back will no longer be as difficult as usual.
Try to find an area where you are not at risk of being trapped again, or consider waiting for help, based on your skills and whether you have been spotted.
The re-entry shock occurs in a shorter time than the cultural shock (as there is a shorter "honeymoon" phase), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travelers who have found it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes have difficulty readapting to the culture of their own country of origin.
When you return home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of the customs of your original culture.
In your first experience abroad, you are likely to have met patient and understanding people, aware of the fact that travelers in a new country need to adjust.
Many people did not imagine that patience and awareness were also necessary for those returning home.
The sound and light show of the pyramid is the most interesting thing for children in the area.
Before the show begins, you can admire the pyramids immersed in darkness and silence.
Normally you always hear the noise caused by tourists and vendors. The show of sounds and lights is just like a book of stories.
The Sphinx becomes the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by various countries, the southern Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the highest number of bases, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among the other islands are Livingston Island and Deception; in the latter, the caldera of an active volcano filled with water has given rise to a magnificent natural harbor.
The Ellsworth Land is the region located south of the peninsula and overlooking the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then re-emerge and form the Ellsworth Mountains, a 360 km long chain cut in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Range, boasts the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only possible alternative.
A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a cell phone, because you have to be outside with an unobstructed view of the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by pleasure boats, including those for leisure, as well as by missions that need data and voice at a distance.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
One of the increasingly popular options for those planning to take a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly popular among recent graduates, as they can take a year off before starting university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad during the sabbatical year can actually increase the chances of resuming higher education upon return to one's home country.
Usually, enrollment in these educational programs requires payment of a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love sailing. In the "Land of a thousand lakes", there are also thousands of islands, both within the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht for archipelagos and lakes.
Even if the coastal archipelagos and the larger lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime of Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This also happens in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in general it is a rather singular fact (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Most of the different Baltic cruises include a multi-day stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that it is possible to visit the historic town for two whole days, returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.
For the disembarkation on land, a separate visa will not be necessary (as of 2009) using the on-board excursions.
Some brochures also offer cruises to Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be scary for people of all ages and conditions, especially if they have never flown before or have had some traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not dissimilar from the fears and personal aversions that many people manifest towards other things.
For some people, understanding a bit about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can be useful to overcome a fear based on what is unknown, or on not having control.
Delivery drivers are well paid to deliver products quickly. Often, timing is very important in the case of business documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
For some routes, the larger companies use their own planes, but for other routes and in the case of smaller companies, problems emerged.
On some routes, air shipments would take days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to get it there faster would be to ship it as checked luggage, and that's where you come in, since airline regulations do not allow luggage to be shipped without a passenger.
To fly first class or business class, the obvious way is to pay a lot of money for the privilege (or, even better, convince your company to do it).
However, the price to pay is high: you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business travel and up to eleven times the fare for first class travel!
In general, on direct flights from A to B, it is not even worth looking for discounts on first class or business class seats.
Airlines know that there is a category of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably at their destination, and as a result, they apply certain fares.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău and the local language is Romanian. However, Russian is also very widespread.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has been the scene of an ethnic conflict in the past.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic relations between these two areas of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is Christian Orthodoxy.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of around 3.7 million; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important transport hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna is built on a huge bay, is surrounded by mountains and currently constitutes a modern, evolved and active commercial center.
Although the city has an atmosphere more similar to that of Mediterranean Europe than that of traditional Turkey, the wide avenues, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers are dotted with the characteristic red tile roofs, the 18th-century market, and ancient mosques and churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and you can visit a unique octagonal church.
In the churchyard, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
Half an hour is enough to walk around the charming village.
To the north is the romantic and charming city of Sintra, easily accessible. It became famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to the brilliant account of its splendors written by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb 403 bus line regularly connects with Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Always to the north, visit the great sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (place of worship), a place of Marian apparitions famous throughout the world.
Remember that the site you are visiting is essentially a mass grave, and it has an almost incalculable significance for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived these places, and many others who saw their loved ones murdered or worked to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Avoid jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Avoid defacing these places by defacing the structures with signs or graffiti.
In the city of Barcelona, the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority is able to understand it; Spanish is known by practically everyone.
However, most of the signs are written exclusively in Catalan, which is the first official language by law.
Spanish, however, is also widely used for public transport and other services.
On the metro, regular announcements are only in Catalan. Any unscheduled service interruptions are communicated in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese, thanks to an automatic system.
Parisians are known to be self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Even if it is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to feel at home in Paris is still to behave in the best possible way, relating to people as a "bien élevé" (well-educated) person. This will definitely make your travels easier.
The rough exterior appearance of Parisians will quickly disappear if you show off some basic good manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is rich in forests, mainly of beech, pine and fir, and is characterized by a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a multiplicity of microclimates, different soils and altitude levels, it presents a great variety of plant communities.
The area is also home to a wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare species such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and capercaillie live in these places, alongside several other more common animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and to cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide stoles for women who arrive unprepared, but if you already have one, especially if it is brightly colored, you will earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long pants down to their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the store at the entrance; however, the clothing is not washed after each user, so wearing these skirts may not be comfortable for you. For men, a single size for everyone!
The Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
Pa amb Oli is a simple, popular summer dish: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the condiments available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, in addition to the pronoun "Sie" used for the polite form of "Lei", always start with a capital letter, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This represents an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
This aspect probably also facilitates reading, although the need to understand whether a verb or an adjective is used in a substantivized form makes writing rather complex.
Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most words are pronounced as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, since their pronunciation changes depending on the vowel that follows.
Also, make sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: caro means beloved, while carro means carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar manual could help you a lot with Persian grammar and understanding sentences.
It goes without saying that if you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with a basic knowledge of Spanish may come to the hasty conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore does not need to be studied separately.
Nowadays, pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete and serve as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution was not a problem during their heyday, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, which are more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes for research are enormous structures in remote areas where the atmospheric conditions are favorable.
The admiration of the cherry blossom, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where the flowering of plums was preferred.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy close to the imperial court.
Plants do their best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take just one.
If you visit an Italian garden, even collecting some specimens of plants will cost you the removal from this place, without discussion.
In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy city to navigate; you can buy practically anything once you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics", just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with the heat (always) and the strong sun (more rarely, when the sky is clear).
Some buses also head north, towards Hebron, the traditional place where the patriarchs of the Bible, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives were buried.
Make sure the bus you want to take reaches the interior of Hebron and does not stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great theme around which to organize a holiday.
For example, you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, you can take a cruise to visit the interesting cities on the Danube, or you can sail on the Erie Canal.
They also define the routes of well-known hiking trails and bike paths.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals of Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
A tradition involves spending Easter night awake in an open place to be able to admire the dawn.
There are of course Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual related to spring and fertility.
In more traditional churches, a Easter Vigil is often celebrated on the Saturday night of the Easter weekend, with congregations often starting the ceremony at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally came to the islands arrived by swimming, flying or floating.
Since the distance from the mainland was considerable, the mammals were unable to make the journey. This led to the giant tortoise becoming the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Numerous mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs and cats were introduced to the Galapagos after the arrival of humans.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic territories during the winter, you can experience the polar night, when the sun remains below the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the opportunity to witness the Northern Lights, because the sky remains dark almost all day.
Since the territories are sparsely populated, light pollution is often not a problem and you can also enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners tend to be used to.
Office clothing usually consists of a jacket and tie or a suit and one addresses colleagues by their surname or professional title.
The harmony of the workplace is of crucial importance, as it emphasizes the commitment of the group rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often need to get the approval of their superiors for every decision, and they are expected to follow instructions without asking questions.
