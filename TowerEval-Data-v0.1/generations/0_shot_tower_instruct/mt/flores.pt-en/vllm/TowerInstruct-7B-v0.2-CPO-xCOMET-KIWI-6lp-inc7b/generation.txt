This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already well accepted, but also offers details that are not found as often in fossils, such as colors and the three-dimensional arrangement.
. Scientists claim that the upper plumage of this animal was chestnut and the lower part was light or carotenoid.
The discovery also provides clues about the evolution of feathers in birds.
Dinosaur feathers, known as rakes, do not have a well-developed shaft, but do have other features, such as spines and barbules. In view of this, the researchers concluded that the rake was possibly the result of an evolutionary development subsequent to these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for display or temperature regulation. The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample has the plumage of an adult, not a juvenile.
The researchers suggested that, despite the tail being from a young dinosaur, the sample reveals adult plumage, not down.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other people.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts an attraction on Earth, causing the tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around a galaxy in a kind of halo and is made up of various tiny particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
He warned that the new variant was "very worrying and alarming because of the high mortality rate," in an interview.
According to Dr. Moll, some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital and at least two were healthcare professionals.
Over the course of a year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 close contacts.

They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as the large caverns on planet Earth, which usually maintain a very constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing, of the Astrogeology Team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters retreat to a booth and drop a pre-printed sheet into an envelope indicating the candidate of their choice.
After the officers verify the voter's identity, the voter inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting list.
French electoral law codifies the procedures in a very strict manner.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that no envelopes are present at the start of the voting and that no envelopes are added, except those of the duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe all parts of the process. During the night, votes are counted by volunteers under careful supervision, following specific procedures.

His first was the slalom, where he received a "Did Not Finish" in his first race. 36 out of 116 competitors achieved the same result in the race.
Her other race, the Giant Slalom, saw her in 10th place in the sitting women's group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 slower than the Australian winner Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-placed Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four female skiers in the women's group failed to finish their races, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify for the race.
The Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused were named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
The accused appeared in court with his face covered, declared police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki.
Despite three people being inside the house when it was hit by the car, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver of the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been in the Sheriff Court in Edinburgh since then, charged with the murder of her son.
She is in custody while awaiting charges and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be compromised because her image has been widely circulated.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice operates differently, and the courts consider the publication of photos as potentially damaging.
Dundee University's Professor Pamela Ferguson notes that "journalists seem to go down a dangerous path when they publish photos, videos, etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is in overall charge of the case, has told journalists that no further comment will be made, at least until charges are laid.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the dispute over borders, which Palestine wants based on the borders before the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other issues covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to leave this presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplemental pest control trial were closely supervised by forestry engineers as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited, according to the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Conservation and Heritage Park Manager for NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
Yesterday, Martelly promised a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the prior resignation of the CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was the response given by Martelly to the general protests organized against the regime. The demonstrations began in October.
The occasionally violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been scheduled since 2011.
About 60 cases of iPods with overheating problems were reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI disclosed that Apple had informed it of an additional 34 overheating incidents, which the company classified as "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay in reporting the issue "truly regrettable."
The earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 local time. At GMT time, it was on Friday at 21:19.
The North Marianas Emergency Management Office said there were no reported damages in the country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer hijacked a tourist bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and held the passengers hostage in Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as well as the Filipino photographers.
Then, photographers took the place of an elderly lady who needed to use the toilet. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and started working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Although he was working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births in his free time.
Their research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would speed up the fetal lung maturation of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes," flight data recorders, on Wednesday.
Other fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said that "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first business partner. Luna passed away on a night with two moons. Something exceptional, just like her. Strong woman."
Dustin Goldust Runnels said: "Luna was as crazy as me... or maybe even more... I loved her and will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
Among the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, the percentage of those opposed to change in Australia to become a republic has grown by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 campaign for the national election that she believed that Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those surveyed share this view, wishing that Queen Elizabeth II will be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was called into question due to his complaints.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome the pain, as these are banned in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at Central Missouri University, discovered the largest prime number known to date on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using different types of hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were a source of water delivery to the Earth along with organic matter that could develop proteins and make life possible.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "politicking and nonsense"
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would let planes fly on shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There will be no extra transport and surface trains will not stop at Wembley. Parking and public transport connections will not be available.
The problem of the lack of transport has increased the possibility of the game having to be played behind closed doors, without the presence of the fans.
On Thursday, the magazine Science published a study reporting the discovery of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process would take much longer, due to reproduction between an endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant finch cactus, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked in any type of form. It can even be rolled into small shapes.
It is possible to stretch it to form a thin thread, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be very thin and glued onto another metal. Because it is so thin, it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted frames in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called chemical pH. You can make a marker using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two powders together and, with clean hands, shape them into a ball.
The moisture from your hands reacts with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and forming a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, frequented by both men and women.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then redirects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
A giant rocket more than 30 meters tall is needed to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is give us much easier and faster transportation.
We gave him the train, the car and various other forms of transportation.
Below them are the medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including feral pets) that eat much more numerous small animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of niche, a special function that each cat performs that prevents them from competing with each other.
Lions are the most social of the big cats, living in large groups called prides.
The gangs consist of one to three adult males from the same family, along with up to 30 females and offspring.
Women are often closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides act in a similar way to wolf or dog packs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behaviour, and also very deadly to their prey.
A well-balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (albeit not well), swim, jump great distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and cougars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the all-out roar of a lion, but more like a sentence of shouted words and growls.
Jaguarundis like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the jaguarundi hunts are much smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that jaguarundis track and find their prey by smell, sniffing out where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and are also able to move stealthily. Jaguarundis hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then attacking their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population they came from (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or go to an island from which it is not possible to return easily), they often find themselves in an environment different from the one they used to inhabit.
This new environment has different resources and new competitors, so the new population will need to acquire different characteristics from those it already has and adapt to become a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it will become less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., breathe out)
Plants use the sun as their food through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes using plants and make our clothes using plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
The Mosasaur was the alpha predator of its era, so the only thing it feared was other Mosasaurus.
Its long jaws were lined with more than 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, showing that nothing that crossed its path could escape.
We're not sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that went into the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex would not stand a chance against it.
Although most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans still had their share of strange or unusual foods, such as wild boar, peacock, snail, and a type of rodent called arganaz
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting in chairs, wealthy men liked to hold banquets together where they lay on their sides while eating their meals.
Food in ancient Rome did not include provisions from America and Asia for Europe, as was the case in later centuries.
For example, they did not have maize, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians made a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of their respective god.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and priests sought to meet the needs of these gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramids in the shape of towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family life took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard, shops were just open counters facing the street, and stones were used in the construction of the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely colonized. In the Nordic sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, while traveling west, he found Greenland and gave it that name.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although all the countries were "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've ever seen the movie The Treasure Seekers, you might think a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776." The text appears at the bottom corner of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that, in the early days of its existence, the large parchment document (it measures 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Thus, it is likely that a note was simply added as a label.
The landings and subsequent battles on D-Day liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by the French "Vichy". These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and which also, in some way, defines the size of society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. The culture of civilization derives from the passing of knowledge from different generations, a lasting cultural reach and a fair dissemination.
Smaller cultures often fade away without leaving proper historical evidence and are no longer recognized as civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—the Congress being its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to demand taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, which generally did not cooperate, to enforce all of its laws.
Furthermore, there was no authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between the states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives were almost never present.
The Italian football team, along with the German team, is the second most successful in the world and was the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has around 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, in a geographical position, as an "archipelago"
Taiwan's foundation dates back to the 15th century, when Europeans sailing through the region named the place Ilha Formosa.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in the practices of producing indigenous grains and employing Chinese to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it cedes sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governs the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the complex's perimeter have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
In the year 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was recovered, and this recovery continues to this day.
As an example, the most common form of still image photography on the planet is the 35mm format, which was the size of film that was most in circulation at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but the most important thing is that its proportion has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is, in fact, confusingly, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The screen aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to get the smallest ratio of whole numbers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or very close to this ratio.
The much-abused and often demoralized law of thirds is a very simple guideline that provides dynamics while maintaining a relative order in a figure.
According to him, the intersection of the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see the example) is the most effective place for the main subject.
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion united the European states, despite differences in language and customs. I
Everyone was affected by his influential strength, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for that reason.
The central leadership of the church has been in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle is being upheld.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Great Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, with the cutting off of vital supplies to both military and civilians, although this blockade violated generally accepted international regulations and was laid out in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire areas of the ocean, posing a danger even to neutral-flagged vessels.
Germany, as there was limited response to this tactic, expected a similar attack to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in the city of New York.
He arrived in the United States with no money, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the head of his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of demonstrating different eras; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Moreover, between each dynasty there was an unstable era of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a fierce war occurred between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of Ancient China, with thousands of people dying fighting to sit on the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not a single ruler.
Moreover, after the Revolution, places were opened up to all male candidates, enabling the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same goes for the military, as instead of ranks being based on social class, they are now based on character.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the mundane life. He used to frequent a cave that became known as "Hira'" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The very cave, which has survived the ages, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's religious inclinations.
Perched on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find it, even if you know it exists. Once inside the cave, it is total isolation.
It is not possible to see anything other than the clear blue sky above and the mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, has several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upward-pointing bow" mark has a similar appearance to a V, and the "downward-pointing bow" mark has a similar appearance to a clamp or a square without the bottom side.
Cima means you should start at the tip and push the bow; low means you should start at the grip (which is where you hold the bow) and pull the bow.
In general, an upward bow produces a softer sound, while a downward bow produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
You can write your own notes, but don't forget that printed bowings exist for a musical reason, so these should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Maria Theresa, 11, and Louis Charles, 4), and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris, departing from Versailles, by a crowd of market women.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and screaming threats against the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a protester waved the head of a dead royal guard at the terrified queen in front of her.
The war expenses of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on floating-rate bonds on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the superprofits generated from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The time when such events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history between the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Late Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a number of ideas in practice, from the supply of technology or the technological imperative to a strict notion that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: the first is that technological development itself follows a path that goes beyond cultural or political influence; the second is the idea that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, someone might say that the automobile necessarily results in the development of roads.
Meanwhile, a national road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The possession of mass cars leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the healthcare system to heal the injured bodies.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
Geography, in the context of Romanticism, shaped citizens and, over time, customs and culture emerged linked to that geography, which, by being in harmony with the place of society, became better than the laws that were eventually mandatory.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until around 1100 A.D.
Its status declined during the 12th century mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders who returned brought back gifts such as silks and spices, which were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was during this time that the transfer of the title of Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris took place.
Gothic language reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and also in the 14th century.
At first, the clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the eastern region.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the west may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances for the time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to close their garments.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture carried out for the production of enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmers and their families.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, usually organic, that uses native seed stocks from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, most farmers were involved in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in most developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to appeal to the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults while they were growing up.
These children are called "ferozes" or wild. Some of these children were confined by people (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the rejection of the child by the parents because of their severe intellectual or physical disability.
Children who are rebellious may have suffered serious trauma or abuse in childhood before being abandoned or running away from home.
It is assumed that others were created by animals; some are said to have lived on their own in the jungle.
When fully raised by animals, the wild child displays behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to that of the pet, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding method goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help for students who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual or physical, in other words, a teacher can be considered a scaffold, as well as that little talking clip from Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolding is built into the software in order to question, alert and explain procedures that may be challenging for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster homes for a multitude of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that does not nurture, care for and educate them, but it happens.
We see the Family Host System as a safe zone for these children.
Our adoption platform has a duty to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, regular education, and guaranteed medical care.
Foster care is supposed to meet all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were taken.
The internet combines elements of both interpersonal and mass communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the approach to uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are indicated as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "relationships with continuity" were also identified as new motivational characteristics by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the public's reactions to web pages.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that a person can detect if another person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, indicated how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are, despite this, able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth century research concluded that there are two ways of genetic variation: secretive and manifest.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mixes the variation between the two bases with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans, consuming the available plant resources, to meet its amino acid requirements.
Moreover, not acting accordingly has serious consequences: severe depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The plant-based resources with the greatest accessibility would be the proteins in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for us primates to digest, unless they are cooked.
Meanwhile, foods of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide a large amount of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
Taking all of this into account, it would not be surprising if our own ancestors solved their "protein problems" more or less as the current savannah chimpanzees do.
Sleep interruption is a process that involves waking up intentionally during the normal period of sleep and falling asleep soon after (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a half-quiet alarm to bring him to consciousness without waking him up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off
Other biorhythm-based possibilities include drinking plenty of liquid (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, as it forces the person to get up to urinate.
A person's level of inner peace correlates inversely with their level of bodily and spiritual tension.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques of Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the kundalini energy (illuminating energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The central part of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleared, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common villain in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, systemic shocks, processes, and cultures led to the disintegration of countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
The goal was to last for the next 40 years and, in fact, there would be replacement troop leadership on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already destroyed and the only way out was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, those plans became obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral treaties.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient means of moving people and goods on a large scale across the oceans.
The job of navies has traditionally been to ensure that their country maintains the ability to move people and goods while, at the same time, interfering with their enemies' ability to move their own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic battle of World War II. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy organization, using mostly U-boats, was trying to end this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have the ability to conquer Great Britain as it did with the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them in order to facilitate access to milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by shepherds who were often children or teenagers, similar to the more well-known shepherd. These methods of herding are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England from the 16th century.
Although the wagons consisted only of parallel wooden planks, this allowed horses to pull them to achieve higher speeds and carry larger loads on slightly more bumpy roads.
Dormers were implemented right at the beginning, to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they had a metal cover on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron tracks were introduced.
The first known means of transportation was walking. Humans began walking upright two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means "upright man").
Its predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as usual.
Adaptations for bipedality are found in the fossils of Australopithecus dating back between 4.2 and 3.9 million years ago. However, Sahelanthropus may have walked upright on two legs much earlier, seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is exactly how symptomatic treatment is in many cases. However, if we do not want to have only a temporary solution, we must find the source of the problems and get rid of them.
It is obvious enough that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advancements of the human race, and problems have become greater because of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of man.
After adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to a printing shop owned by John Dunlap.
During the night, around 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap attacks".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the Independence Hall courtyard on July 8.
On July 6, one was sent to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap copies that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original hand-copied document did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still many similarities between birds and dinosaurs.
They have scaled feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-rex.
Almost all computers currently in use are based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, that is, 0 or 1, and these numbers are classified as binary digits - or bits, using the language used in computing.
Internal poisoning may not be apparent immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The biggest clue of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container with medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions related to that particular poison.
The term "insects" is used by entomologists in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are quite structured insects that stick to humans.
Both beard lice and bed bugs are nesting, adapted to live in nests or shelters of their hosts.
In the United States of America, there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and adult people
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interest, or their child's.
Such couples are allowed to decide to make a plan to adopt the baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can care for the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. It is this method that guides scientific research.
It is not, in fact, only experimentation; an experiment is a test used to eliminate one of the possible hypotheses or more, to ask questions. Making observations also guides a scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and in particular, the Latin Bible.
All of Aristotle's scientific thoughts were accepted, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek receded, the West found itself distant from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are fundamentally dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not absolutely responses to external periodic stimuli, have been found for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to function for a period of continuous cycle, even without the interference of the environment.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indicators that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase use phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments that either tagged the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other parts can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting areas of nature with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including fauna and flora.
Examples of local activities include fishing, taking photographs, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, by car, people leave the small towns in the countryside to go to work in other cities, and they come across other people who work precisely in those small towns they left.
On this dynamic shuttle bus, everyone is somehow connected and supporting a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now points out that this carbon-based economy has shifted the biosphere from the stable state that had allowed human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone also complains about these transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints, why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent, or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the analysis of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two different points and the interactions they make with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a relatively consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
Such relationships assist in the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them to escape enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a greater range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed otherwise; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That sounds sensible, because the planet Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon is the largest river and the second longest on Earth. It carries more than eight times the amount of water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes measuring almost 10 km in width.
A total of 20% of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Empire, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical excellence of construction.
The New Kingdom Egyptians marveled at the constructions of their predecessors, which were up to that point over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the common language used by most who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper because they can all be discovered in nature in their natural form and are relatively simple to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is a mixture of one or more of four elements, which are earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more related to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are simply a mixture of two or more metals. Don’t forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also make alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
All things in the universe are made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that it would be possible for trillions of them to fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it was first launched.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods appeared, the pencil was relegated to a less important role and use.
Nowadays, people write messages through computer screens and don’t need to get close to a pointer.
We can only imagine what the keyboard will become when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to build a nucleus with several protons and neutrons.
It's more or less like walking up a hill with a heavy cart. The division of the core then releases some of that energy again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to split with little or no encouragement.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is 70 km thick on the visible side and 100 km thick on the invisible side.
The layer is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
There may be more maria on the nearest side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what motivates people or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they reach adulthood.
These theories look at what is in certain people that makes them want to do what they do and what things in their environment will cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg’s Two-Factor Theory.
Broadly speaking, two behaviors can emerge as managers begin to lead their former colleagues: One side of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, adopting disciplinary measures, conducting performance evaluations, delegating and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that they must change everything that the team has done and do it their own way.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of a team.
This behavior often ends up in conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams have to maintain the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, however, there are some subtle differences.
Members of the virtual team usually act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may be located in different time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to whom each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the difficult process of establishing organizational learning? One of the practical goals of the concepts of organizational learning is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used by all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity shine through.
As a result, the process of a team working organization overcoming a difficulty can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer’s need.
Even before an organization can be innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) clarifies the Continuum approach as a methodology used to help organizations achieve higher levels in their performances.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition, therefore narrowing the research area and making it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain and behavioral pathology underpins scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to design simulation models that help us understand the processes that exist in our mind.
Although AI has a strong connotation of science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science, addressing the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Research in AI involves the production of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent activity.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to address customer issues and diagnoses, as well as the recognition of writing, voice and speech.
These things have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it is integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
Study tours are very important for any school class. Often, teachers would love to take their students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. From the classroom, students can see pieces from museums, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina develop a website about their trip to the state capital. Each year, the website is redesigned, but old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Since students often start their blogging with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of a general audience often changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to strive to improve writing and avoid criticism.
Moreover, having a blog "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them." The need to feed the interest of the audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Writing blogs is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can make students more analytical and critical; by interacting with Internet content in an active way, students can position themselves in the context of the writings of others, as well as define their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming and bilingual capital of Canada and boasts a number of art galleries and museums that demonstrate Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls are further south; the north has the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and much more.
Because of all of this and more, Ontario stands out as what outsiders consider the essence of Canada.
Large areas further north are also quite sparsely populated, and some are virtually uninhabited.
For comparison's sake, a fact that surprises many people: there are more African Americans living in the USA than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean, at a distance from the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent on its own when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known for their luxurious beach hotels.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the land, which gained a lot of popularity in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their current marital status.
It is also useful to use a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences may lead to acts that they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men. Don’t be afraid to stand your ground (whether it’s cultural differences or not, that doesn’t mean it’s okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, which was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco as a whole.
Close to the historic part of Medina, it is easy to find traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole lot of trinkets, all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the far east, near Rwanda.
In the year 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried a large part of the city's streets, mainly the center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside of Goma should be studied to understand the state of the battle that persists in the province of Nord-Kivu.
The city is also a base for scaling the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla treks in Africa.
You can use a bodaboda (mototaxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a quick ride.
"Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor for referring to distant and exotic lands, given its relative inaccessibility.
Today, Timbuktu is a depleted city despite its reputation making it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was placed on the list of endangered world heritage sites due to the danger of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during the Wonders of the African World program by Henry Louis Gates, broadcast on the PBS channel.
The city contrasts strongly with the rest of the country because it has a more Arabic than African feel to it.
Kruger National Park is located in the northeast of South Africa, along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River on the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different animal species.
It is one of South Africa's top attractions and is considered the flagship of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
There are fees for entry and park conservation, as is the case with all South African national parks.
It can also be very useful to acquire a Wild Card. With it, you can have access to several parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong territory and is the place that many tourists consider to be its main attraction.
The parade of buildings that form the skyline of Hong Kong has already been compared to a glowing bar graph that becomes visible due to the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, head off the island and over to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers chose to live, and so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a great place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park
But forests are not just about mangrove swamps - they have some of the last great jungles that once covered the remaining Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², with one third of it covered by water/swamp areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 deer spotted in the area.
There are several bus departure times from the inter-district bus station (across the river) during the day, but most, especially those going to the east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
As inter-district buses are almost always crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese coastal minibuses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It crosses the Oiapoque River to connect the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 metres, are 378 metres long and have two tracks 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011 and it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to go into operation in September 2017, the date planned for the completion of customs inspections in Brazil.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaicurus and the Paiaguás, who lived off hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies," emerged from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has succeeded in preserving many of its characteristics and the identity of its indigenous populations.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Tournaments and smaller matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check out the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is generally accepted anywhere on the islands and credit cards and US dollars are accepted in Stanley.
In remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted. Please inquire with the owners in advance to find out what method of payment they accept.
It is virtually impossible to change the current currency of the Falkland Islands outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
As Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there, while it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical region; in the summer months, temperatures above 30°C are common.
Winter can be disappointingly cold: temperatures rarely get below freezing, but the combined wind and humidity make it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains basically the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to the presence of humans, they are still wild animals that should not be fed or disturbed.
Following the instructions of the park authorities, keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
Despite their docile appearance, bison, moose and bears, as well as all large animals, can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep a proper distance. These animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so don't get too close.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a well-known naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Great Britain refused to leave it.
All the ships were sunk, with the exception of a cruiser from Great Britain. Nearly 200 lives of Germans and Americans were lost.
During the Mau movement's fight for independence, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the murder of the supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is situated between two bays. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches on the north coast (in the North Harbour district) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and many have shade from the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in the central region of Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a wide variety of shops around the coast. Swimming is very safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One'. It is not an elaborate beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to enjoy, but New Zealand and Australian wines can stand up well.
Local tap water is completely safe to drink, but it’s easy to find bottled water if you’re worried.
For Australians, the concept of a "flat white" coffee is strange. A short black coffee is an "espresso," a cappuccino comes full of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is in line with Belgian standards. The natural juices are expensive, but great.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes that occur on the reef are rare.
Keep heeding the reminders of the authorities, obeying all the signs and paying close attention to the safety alerts.
The box jellyfish occurs near beaches and river estuaries from October to April, north of 1770. They can occasionally be found in other periods.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most are afraid of humans and tend to swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean. Their main habitat is the estuaries of the rivers that are north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents usually do business with specific hotels, although it is likely possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campgrounds, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even packages that combine flights and hotels.
They can also secure your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or gather other documents for your destination (e.g., visa).
However, if you have any changes or requests, these must first be forwarded to the travel agent, and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival-goers decide to camp on site, and most of them consider this a key part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you’ll have to get there early to be able to camp near the music.
Remember that even after the music on the main stages has ended, some sections of the festival may continue playing late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the North Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice generates a terrible noise for the most sensitive.
St. Petersburg cruises include city tours. Passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms).
Casinos usually make a lot of efforts to maximize the time and money spent by their visitors. In general, there are no windows or clocks, and exits can be hard to find.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment offers to keep guests in good spirits and to keep them on the premises.
Some venues offer free alcoholic drinks. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Whenever someone is driving in places with high latitudes or on roads over mountains, they should take into account the possibility of encountering snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On roads with ice and snow, the friction is low, and you cannot drive as if you were on a clean asphalt.
During snowstorms, it is possible to get enough snow to leave you stranded in no time.
Visibility can also be reduced by falling snow or wind, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic remains almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the apple of the eye of many visitors.
The term "safari," in its colloquial use, refers to land-based trips to observe the impressive African wildlife, mainly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, have a tendency to approach cars, and the basic equipment makes for good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, and you will see them better with binoculars.
Also known as "forest walking", "walking safari" or "passada", a walking safari is equivalent to walking, whether for a few hours or many days.
The Paralympics will take place between August 24 and September 5, 2021. Some events will be hosted in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having been the host of the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March most cancellation policies due to the coronavirus did not extend through July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets for the events will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with regular tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Hanging wet clothes up to dry can help. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board for loan, even if there isn't one in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you don't like wearing pinned socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if it is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause it to shrink or, in more serious cases, cause burns).
There are different ways to purify water, some more efficient against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling the water for a minute is enough; in others, many minutes are needed.
The quality of filters varies, and if you are in doubt, it might be a good idea to consider buying gallons of water from a trusted company.
Travellers may encounter animal pests with which they are not familiar in the regions they come from.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people through force, generally do not qualify as pests.
Duty free shopping is the chance to buy tax-free and duty-free goods in certain locations.
Travelers visiting countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging conditions for drivers on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, who often pass through isolated wilderness areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, use your judgement: steep inclines, narrow tracks and sharp bends are common.
The posted speed limits are visibly lower than in the previous and subsequent sections - usually 55-65 km/h - and strict adherence to them is even more important than the opposite.
Interestingly, however, cell phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, such as in Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are very good and, in Bavaria, they are very elaborate and varied, similar to those of its neighbor to the south, Austria.
Fruit sweets are common, with baked apples in sweets all year round, and cherries and plums making an appearance during the summer.
Many goods from German bakeries also have almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. The famous cakes usually go very well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but tasty sweets, try what, depending on the region, may be called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a broad spectrum that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But, if used without other qualifiers, the term tends to mean that the food originally comes from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes a variety of simply seasoned dishes, with the predominant Javanese preference for peanuts, chilies, sugar (mostly Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
In order for a knight's feet to have support, stirrups are used, which are hung on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but can present safety issues as the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has one of his feet caught in the stirrup, he may be dragged if the animal runs off. To reduce this danger, several safety precautions can be taken.
First, a large part of the riders use jumping boots with a flat sole, which is quite narrow.
Next, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a leather stirrup to fall from the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
As the main climbing destination in Chile, the Cochamó Valley is known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite cliffs and walls.
Meetings include exciting views of the peaks. Alpinists from all over the world are continuously establishing new routes among its infinite potential of cliffs.
Snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding over snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard strapped to your feet.
Skiing is an important activity on the trip for many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations just to ski at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old—rock paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski team was opened by citizens of Norway in Australia.
Ski backpacking: activity also known as backcountry skiing, touring skiing or ski mountaineering.
It is related, but generally does not involve ski touring or mountaineering, the latter done on steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a hiking route.
In good conditions, you can cover a bit more distance than on foot - but you will only rarely be able to achieve cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack on prepared slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries. Normally, traveling through several countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport control several times.
The Schengen zone, however, functions as one country in this regard.
If you stay in this area, it is possible to cross the border without going through passport control posts again.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you will not need to apply for visas for each of the Schengen member countries separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that specifies which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define items that are more than 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be defined as antiques, even though they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sámi, and the culture surrounding the trade is important to many other classes of professionals as well.
As much as it is a tradition, not all Sami participated in the large-scale reindeer breeding, but lived off fishing, hunting and such, with reindeer primarily serving as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi work with modern businesses. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.
Although it is widely used, especially among non-Romany people, the term "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Romani people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to travel advisories, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
It is also recommended that you consult other governments besides your own, but their advice is made for their respective citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than those faced by Europeans or Arabs.
Councils are only a brief summary of the political situation in a nation.
The views presented are usually superficial, general and simplified in relation to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Bad weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
Bad weather can occur anywhere in the world and encompasses different types, which vary according to geographical location, topography and meteorological conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation and forest fires are forms and effects of a harsh climate, as well as storms, tornadoes, water spouts and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include snowstorms, as well as snow, ice and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to keep an eye on any risk of bad weather in their region, as this can affect travel plans.
When planning a visit to a country that is considered a war zone, the person must first receive professional training.
A search on the Internet for 'Hostile environment course' will usually reveal the address of a company in the area.
A course will usually cover all the topics discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course usually lasts between 2 and 5 days and involves role-playing, various first aid techniques, and sometimes training with weapons.
Books and magazines about survival in the jungle are common, but publications about war zones are rare.
Travellers planning gender reassignment surgery overseas should ensure they have valid travel documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with an undefined gender (X), or updated documents to find a desired name and gender, varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is widely variable.
Searches at security checkpoints also became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not yet had gender reassignment surgery should not have to expect to go through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Returning currents are the reflux of the water of the waves on the beach back to the sea, usually in a reef or similar area.
Due to the sub-aquatic topography, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections, and a rapid current can form for deep water there.
Most deaths are the result of exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you can get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than it would usually be.
Try to aim from somewhere where you can't be caught or, depending on your skills or if you have been detected, wait for rescue.
The re-entry shock occurs before the culture shock (it takes less honeymoon time), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have easily adapted to a new culture sometimes have a special difficulty in readjusting to their native culture.
When returning home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits of your local culture.
When you went abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People don’t realize that patience and understanding are also key for travelers who are heading home.
In the area reserved for children, one of the most interesting things is the light and sound show of the pyramid.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and also in silence before the show starts.
Normally you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The history of the sound and light is like a book of stories.
The Sphinx is defined as the backdrop and narrator of a long history.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the largest number of bases, with sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, where the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
The others are Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, coastal to the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Peninsula here merge into the plateau, then reemerge to form the 360 km chain of Ellsworth Mountains, cut by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, reaching 4,892 m at Mount Vinson.
In remote locations with no cellular coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone generally does not replace a cell phone, as to make a call you need to be out in the open with a view of the satellite.
The service is often used for transportation, including recreational vessels, as well as expeditions that have remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone operator may be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those who want to take a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among those leaving school, allowing them to take a gap year before university without compromising their education.
In most cases, enrolling in a course abroad during a gap year can, in fact, increase your chances of entering higher education in your home country.
Typically, there will be an enrollment fee to enroll in these educational programs.
For those who enjoy boat trips, Finland is a great destination. In the lakes and coastal archipelagos, the “Land of a Thousand Lakes” also has thousands of islands.
In archipelagos and lakes, you don’t necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the larger lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating with a boat is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is combined by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but a rather characteristic form (for example, in the Netherlands, the number is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for two full days and return to the ship to sleep at night.
If you only embark on sea excursions, you will not need a separate visa (valid from 2009).
Some cruises advertise Berlin, Germany, in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be a scary experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if those people have never flown before or have never experienced a traumatic event.
It’s not something to be ashamed of: it’s no different from personal fears and dislikes for other things that many people have.
For some, understanding something about how aircraft work and what happens during a flight can help overcome fears based on the unknown or not being in control.
Shipping companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Often, time is very important when sending commercial documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, there has been a problem.
If they sent things by air freight, depending on the route, it can take days to get to the disembarkation point and go through customs.
The only way to get through faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations don't allow them to send bags without a passenger, which is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to shell out a lot of money for the privilege (or, better yet, have your company do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times more than the normal economy fare for business class and eleven times more for first class!
In general terms, it is not worth even looking for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a small group of passengers who are willing to pay a high price for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The language of the country is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any country that is a member of the UN.
Economic relations have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is Turkey's third largest city, with approximately 3.7 million people, and has the second largest port after Istanbul, as well as an excellent transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, now it is a modern, developed and bustling commercial center, located around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide avenues, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centres are punctuated by traditional red roofs, the 18th-century market, and the old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than classic Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.

Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not damage the place by staining or cracking the buildings with graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half of the people prefer to speak Catalan, a large part understands it, and almost everyone knows Spanish
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, because this is the language that has been established by law as an official language.
Still, Spanish is widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and arrogant.
Although this is often just an inadequate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is still good behavior, acting like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will make the trip considerably easier.
The brusque exterior of Parisians will quickly disappear if you show some basic courtesies
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is highly forested, mainly with beech, fir, and pine trees, and features a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
There is a remarkable diversity of plant communities due to the varied microclimates, different soils and different altitude levels.
The area is also home to a wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals can be found there, such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wild cats and tetrazzes, as well as several other common species
While visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts covering their knees and also need to have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide robes for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own robes, especially ones with bright colors, you will be greeted with a smile from the monk or nun.
Similarly, men are required to wear pants that cover their knees.
It is possible to borrow clothes at the entrance; however, they are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. For men, there is a single size!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in everything.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any ingredient at hand, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, along with the word Sie for you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
This also makes reading easier, no doubt, although the writing is somewhat complicated by the need to figure out whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to be observed are C and G, as their pronunciation varies according to the following vowel.
Also, make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means car.
The Persian language has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar handbook will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand the sentences.
Needless to say, if you have knowledge of a Romance language, it will be easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak a bit of Spanish may hastily conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it is not necessary to study separately.
Pre-modern observatories are mostly outdated nowadays and remain in museums or schools.
As light pollution in their heyday was not an issue, they tend to be in cities or university campuses, easier to reach than those built more recently.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations in remote areas that have favorable atmospheric conditions.
Observing cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the favorite flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look better when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" weed.
If you are visiting a formally arranged garden, collecting "specimens" will also get you kicked out, without right to discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place and very easy to explore, and you can buy almost everything once you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the Equator, you'll need to deal with both (constant) heat and strong sun (when the sky is clear, more rarely).
There are also a few buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives.
Check that the bus you intend to take goes to Hebron, and not just to the nearby settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme around which to organize a holiday.

Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the holiday's traditions have been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake in some open place to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend. Congregations often break for midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived in Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a great opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky gets dark around the right time.
As the areas are sparsely populated, and consequently light pollution is not an issue, you will also be able to appreciate the stars.
In Japan, labor cultural relations are more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are used to seeing.
Suits are the standard attire in business, and colleagues call each other by their surnames or titles.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing team effort over individual achievement.
