This not only confirms that at least some of the dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already well accepted, but also offers details that are not found as often in fossils, such as colors and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the upper plumage of this animal was brown and the lower part was light or carotenoid.
The discovery also provides clues about the evolution of feathers in birds.
The feathers of dinosaurs, known as rache, do not have a well-developed shaft, but they have other characteristics, such as spikes and barbs. In view of this, the researchers concluded that the rache was possibly the result of an evolutionary development subsequent to these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for display or temperature regulation. The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample has the plumage of an adult, and not that of a youngster.
The researchers suggested that, although the tail is from a young dinosaur, the sample reveals adult plumage, not down.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two policemen and injuring more than twenty other people.

They found that the sun operated on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all stars in the system was determined by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to define a star's Rossby number, which is related to the flow of plasma.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic reversals.

The work done was, for the most part, theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have managed to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matters in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a sort of halo and is made up of tiny particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
He warned that the new variant was "very worrying and alarming because of the high mortality rate," in an interview.
According to Dr. Moll, some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital and at least two were healthcare professionals.
In the period of one year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 close contacts.

Infrared images show that the temperature variations from night to day indicate that they are probably caves.
They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as the large caves on planet Earth, which usually preserve a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing, of the Astrogeology Team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the University of Northern Arizona, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters seal themselves in a booth and deposit a pre-printed sheet indicating the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting list.
French electoral law codifies the procedures in a very strict manner.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers can witness that no envelopes are present at the beginning of the voting and that no envelopes are added, with the exception of those of the duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe all parts of the process. During the night, votes are counted by volunteers under careful supervision, following specific procedures.

Her other race, the Giant Slalom, obtained the tenth position in the group of women sitting with a combined result of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 slower than the first placed Australian Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth placed Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four female skiers from the group failed to finish their races, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify for the race.
The Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused were named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
The accused appeared in court with his face covered, declared the police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki.
Despite three people being inside the house when it was hit by the car, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver of the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then, charged with the murder of her son.
She is in custody while awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be compromised because her image has been widely circulated.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish justice system operates differently, and the courts consider the publication of photos to be potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, from the University of Dundee, notes that "journalists seem to be going in a dangerous direction when they publish photos, videos, etc. of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is in charge of the general proceedings, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made, at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on the borders before the Six Day War in 1967.
Other issues covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to leave this presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplemental pest control test were under close supervision of forestry engineers while the test was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited, according to the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Interim Director of Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first cull were given comprehensive safety instructions and training.
Yesterday, Martelly promised a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the CEN's prior resignation as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the general protests organized against the regime. The demonstrations began in October.
The occasionally violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been planned since 2011.
About 60 cases of iPods with overheating problems have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI disclosed that Apple had informed it of 34 more overheating incidents, which the company classified as "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling the delay of the Apple report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 local time. In GMT time, it was on Friday at 21:19.
The Northern Mariana Islands emergency management office said there were no reported damages in the country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman hijacked a bus of tourists in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and held them hostage in Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages were rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as well as the Filipino photographers.
Then the photographers took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Although he was working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births in his free time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would speed up the fetal lung maturation of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes," flight data recorders, on Wednesday.
Other fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said that "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night with two moons. Something exceptional, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin Goldust Runnels said: "Luna was as crazy as me... or maybe even more... I loved her and I will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
Among the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, the percentage of those opposed to changing Australia to a republic has grown by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 campaign for the national election that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 per cent of those who participated in the survey share this view, wishing that Queen Elizabeth II be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the research, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100 and 200 meter freestyle and in three relay races in the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition was put into question.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome the pain, as these are prohibited in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using different types of hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were a source of water distribution to the earth along with organic matter that can develop proteins and make life possible.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as being "politicking and nonsense"
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow planes to fly more direct routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater accuracy and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There will be no extra transport and surface trains will not stop at Wembley. Parking and public transport connections will not be available.
The problem of lack of transportation increased the possibility of the game having to be played behind closed doors, without the presence of the fans.
On Thursday, the magazine Science published a study where it reports the discovery of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands, in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process would take much longer, due to the reproduction between an endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked in any type of shape. It can even be rolled into small formats.
It is possible to stretch it to form a thin wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be very thin and glued onto another metal. Because it is so thin, it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted frames in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called chemical PH. You can make a marker using blue cabbage juice.
The beet juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two powders and, with clean hands, shape them into a ball shape.
The moisture from the hands reacts with the outer layers, which causes a strange sensation and forms a type of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
There were also toilets in Ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, frequented by both men and women.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then redirects it back, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
A giant rocket over 30 meters tall is needed to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is give us much easier and faster transportation.
It gave us the train, the car and various other forms of transportation.
Below them are the medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including feral house cats) that eat much more numerous small animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of a niche, a special function that each cat performs that prevents them from competing with each other.
Lions are the most social felines, living in large groups called prides.
The flocks consist of one to three adult males from the same family, along with up to 30 females and young.
Women are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Prides of lions act in a similar way to packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in behaviour, and also very deadly to their prey.
A well-balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (albeit not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the roar of a lion at all, but more like a sentence of shouted and growled words.
Jaguatiricas like to eat small animals. They capture monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the jaguatirica hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that jaguatiricas follow and find their prey by smell, sniffing out where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and can also move stealthily. Jaguatiricas hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then attacking their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population from where they came (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they go to an island from where it is not possible to return easily), they often find themselves in an environment different from the one they inhabited before.
This new environment has different resources and new competitors, so the new population will need to acquire different characteristics from those it already has and adapt to become a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., expire)
Plants use the sun as their food through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses using plants and we make our clothes using plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its era, so the only thing it feared were other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with more than 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, which shows that nothing that crossed its path could escape.
We are not sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex would not be a match for it.
Although most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans still had their share of strange or unusual foods, such as wild boar, peacock, snail and a type of rodent called an arganaz.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, rich men liked to hold banquets together where they lay on their sides while they ate their meals.
The food in ancient Rome did not include provisions originating from America and Asia to Europe, as happened in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians made a primary temple for each of their gods, which were considered the home of their respective god.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and priests sought to meet the needs of these gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramids in the shape of towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of Hebrew family life took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard, the shops were just open counters facing the street, and stones were used in the construction of the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland had its colonization in a sparse way. In the Nordic sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, while traveling west, he found Greenland and gave it that name.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although all the countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie The Legend of the Lost Treasure, you may think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the verso of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776." The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that, at the beginning of its existence, the large parchment document (it measures 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Therefore, it is likely that a note was simply added as a label.
The landings and the following battles on D-Day liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the French "Vichy". They were Frenchmen who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and which also, in some way, defines the size of society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. The culture of civilization involves the transfer of knowledge from one generation to another, a lasting cultural reach and a fair dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving adequate historical evidence and are no longer recognized as civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government — with Congress its only component — under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked the power to demand taxes, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, who generally did not cooperate, to enforce all of its laws.
Furthermore, there was no authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between the states.
The Articles required unanimous consent among all the states before they could be amended and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives were almost never present.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national team, is the second most successful in the world and was the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, in a geographical position, as an "archipelago"
The foundation of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when Europeans sailing through the region named the place Ilha Formosa.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in the practices of indigenous grain production and employing Chinese to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the complex's boundaries have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
In the year 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was recovered, and this recovery continues to this day.
As an example, the most common form of still image photography on the planet is 35 mm, which was the size of film that was most in circulation at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its proportions have been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually, confusingly, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The screen aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the smallest ratio between integers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or very close to this proportion.
The much abused and often discredited third law is a very simple guideline that provides a dynamic while maintaining a relative order in a figure.
According to him, the intersection of the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example) is the most effective place for the main subject.
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion united the European states, despite differences in language and customs.
Everyone was affected by his influential force, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for that reason.
The central leadership of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being upheld.
Soon after the start of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, with the cutting off of vital supplies to military and civilians, although this blockade violated generally accepted international regulations and provisions in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, endangering even neutral flag ships.
Germany, having met limited response to this tactic, expected a similar attack to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with no money, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the boss of his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of demonstrating different eras; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Moreover, between each dynasty there was an unstable era of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a fierce war occurred between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, thousands of people died fighting to sit on the throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Moreover, after the Revolution, vacancies were opened up to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same goes for the military, since instead of ranks being based on social class, they were now based on character.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed people from the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the ages, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's religious inclinations.
Resting atop one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find it, even if you know it exists. Once inside the cave, it is total isolation.
You can see nothing but the clear blue sky above and the mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Necropolis of Giza", in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, has several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upward-pointing arch" mark has a similar appearance to a V, and the "downward-pointing arch" mark has a similar appearance to a staple or a square without the bottom side.
Cima means you should start at the tip and push the bow; baixo means you should start at the handle (which is where you hold the bow) and pull the bow.
In general, an upward bow produces a softer sound, while a downward bow produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
You can write your own notes, but don't forget that printed fingering exists for a musical reason, so these should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, eleven years old, and Louis Charles, four years old), and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris, leaving from Versailles, by a crowd of market women.
In a carriage, they travelled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and screaming threats against the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a protester waved the head of a dead royal guard in front of the terrified queen in Versailles.
The war expenses of the United States imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to fund a large portion of the expenses and floating-rate bond interest on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which such events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history between the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Low Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a range of ideas in practice, from the provision of technology or the technological imperative to a strict notion that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share 2 general ideas: the first is that technological development follows a path that goes beyond cultural or political influence; the second is the idea that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, someone might say that the automobile necessarily results in the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The mass possession of cars leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the health system to heal the wounded bodies.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
Geography, in the context of Romanticism, caused citizens to be molded and, over time, customs and culture linked to that geography emerged, which, by being in harmony with the place of society, became better than the laws that were eventually mandatory.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the 12th century mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silks and spices, which were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic language reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and also in the 14th century.
In the beginning, the clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the eastern region.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the west can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture carried out for the production of enough food to meet only the needs of the farmers and their families.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, usually organic system that uses native seeds saved from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, most farmers have been involved in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in most developing nations.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar mindsets who feel neglected by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to point to the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults while they were growing up.
These children are called "ferocious" or "wild". Some of these children have been confined by people (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the rejection of the child by parts of the parents because of their severe intellectual or physical disability.
Children who are angry may have suffered serious trauma or abuse in childhood, before being abandoned or running away from home.
It is assumed that others were created by animals; it is said that some lived on their own in the jungle.
When completely raised by animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the particular pet, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding method goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a help for students who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual or physical, in other words, a teacher can be considered a scaffold, as well as that little talking clip from Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolds are internalized in the software with the aim of questioning, alerting and explaining procedures that may be challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a multitude of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that does not nurture, care for and educate, but this happens.
We see the Family Reception System as a safe zone for these children.
Our adoption platform has a duty to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, regular education, and guaranteed medical care.
It is assumed that foster care meets all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were taken.
The internet combines elements of both interpersonal and mass communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “relationships with continuity” were also identified as new motivational characteristics by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reactions to web pages.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that a person can detect if another person is lying through the correct interpretation of microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, indicated how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are, nevertheless, able to assess sincerity accurately.
He even suggests that such skills of interpreting human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth century research concluded that there are two ways of genetic variation: secret and manifest.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix up the variation between the two bases with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans, consuming the available plant resources, to satisfy its requirements for amino acids.
Furthermore, not acting accordingly generates serious consequences: severe depression, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The plant-based resources with greater accessibility would be the proteins in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for us primates to digest, unless they are cooked.
However, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide a large amount of protein that contains all essential amino acids.
Taking all of this into account, it would not be surprising if our own ancestors solved their "protein problems" more or less as the current savanna chimpanzees do.
Sleep interruption is a process that consists of waking up intentionally during the normal period of sleep and falling asleep soon after (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a half-loud alarm clock to bring him to consciousness without waking him up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm while sleeping, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off
Other possibilities based on biorhythm include drinking plenty of liquid (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, as it forces the person to get up to urinate.
A person's level of inner peace correlates inversely with their level of bodily and spiritual tension.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force present. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been expanded by the path of love of Mahayana and by many techniques of Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the kundalini energy (illuminating energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The central part of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleared, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common villain in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, systemic shocks, processes and cultures led to the disintegration of countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
The goal was to last for the next 40 years and, in fact, there would be leadership of replacement troops on the battlefields of Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already destroyed and the only way out was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral treaties.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient means of moving people and goods on a large scale across the oceans.
The job of navies has traditionally been to ensure that their country maintains the ability to move people and goods around while, at the same time, interfering with the ability of their enemies to move their own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the Battle of the Atlantic in World War II. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have had the ability to conquer Great Britain as it did with the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them in order to facilitate access to milk, fur, meat and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by shepherds who were usually children or teenagers, similar to the more well-known shepherd. These methods of herding are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England from the 16th century.
Although the wagons consisted only of parallel wooden planks, this allowed horses to pull them to achieve higher speeds and carry larger loads on slightly rougher roads.
Sleepers were implemented early on to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they had a metal cover on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced.
The first known means of transportation was walking. Humans began walking upright two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means "upright man").
Its predecessor, Australopithecus, did not walk upright as usual.
Adaptations to bipedalism are found in the fossils of Australopithecus dating back between 4.2 and 3.9 million years ago. However, Sahelanthropus may have walked upright on two legs much earlier, seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is exactly like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we do not want to have only a temporary solution, we must find the source of the problems and get rid of them.
It is obvious enough that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advancements of the human race, and problems have become greater because of overpopulation and man's extravagant lifestyle.
After adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by the president of Congress, John Hancock, and the secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to a print shop owned by John Dunlap.
During the night around 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap attacks".
The document was first publicly read by John Nixon in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on July 8.
On July 6, one was sent to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still many similarities between birds and dinosaurs.
They have scaled feet and claws, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs, like a T-rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, that is, 0 or 1, and these numbers are classified as binary digits - or bits, using the language used in computing.
The internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The biggest indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions related to this particular poison.
The term "insects" is used by entomologists in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects that are quite structured to stick to humans.
Both lice and lice mites are nidicolous, adapted to live in nests or shelters of their hosts.
In the United States of America, there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young people and adults
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The research showed that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that having a baby is not in their interest, or in their child's interest.
Such couples are allowed to decide to make a plan to adopt the baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can take care of the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. It is this method that guides scientific research.
It is not, in fact, only experimentation; an experiment is a test used to eliminate one of the possible hypotheses or more, to ask questions. Making observations also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and in particular, the Latin Bible.
All of Aristotle's scientific thoughts were accepted, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself distant from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Several rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are usually fundamentally dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not absolutely responses to external periodic stimuli, have been found in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to function for a period of continuous cycle, even without environmental interference.
The experiment by Hershey and Chase was one of the main indicators that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase use phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacterium.
They did two experiments that either labeled the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other parts can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting areas of nature with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including fauna and flora.
Examples of local activities include fishing, taking photographs, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, by car, people leave the small towns in the interior to go to work in other cities, and they come across other people who work precisely in those small towns where they came from.
In this dynamic transport bus, everyone is somehow connected and supporting a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now shows that this carbon-based economy has shifted the biosphere from the stable state that had allowed human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone also complains about those transportation systems.
In developed countries, one rarely hears similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they fail daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the analysis of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two different points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a relatively consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
Such relationships aid in the planning, design, and operation of transportation facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them to escape enemies more easily and to find food and partners more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a greater range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That sounds sensible, because planet Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon is the largest river and the second longest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes with a width of almost 10 km.
A total of 20% of the water that goes from the planet's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the constructions of their predecessors, which by then were more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the common language used by most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, because they can all be found in nature in their natural form and are relatively simple to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is a mixture of one or more of four elements, which are earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more related to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are simply a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered to be metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also make alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
All things in the Universe are made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so astonishingly small that trillions of them could fit at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it was launched.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods appeared, the pencil was relegated to a less important role and use.
Nowadays, people write messages through computer screens and don't need to get close to a pointer.
We can only imagine what the keyboard will become when something new comes along.
The fission bomb works based on the principle that energy is needed to build a nucleus with several protons and neutrons.
It's sort of like walking with a heavy cart up a hill. The splitting of the nucleus releases that energy again, so a little bit of it is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to split apart with little or no encouragement.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is 70 km thick on the visible side and 100 km thick on the invisible side.
The layer is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
There may be more magma on the closer side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what motivates people or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they reach adulthood.
These theories analyze what is in certain people that makes them want to do what they do and what things in their environment will cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general terms, two behaviors can emerge as managers start leading their former colleagues. One side of the spectrum tries to stay "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, adopting disciplinary measures, making performance evaluations, delegating and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that they must change everything the team has done and do their own thing.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of a team.
This behavior often ends up in conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams have to maintain the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, however, there are some subtle differences.
Members of the virtual team usually act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may be located in different time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to whom each member must report. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the difficult process of establishing organizational learning? One of the practical goals of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used by all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity shine through.
As a result, the process of an organization working as a team to overcome a difficulty can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer's need.
Before an organization can be innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) clarifies the Continuum approach as a methodology used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research, thus narrowing the field of research and making it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavioral patterns supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to design simulation models that help us understand the processes that exist in our mind.
Although AI has a strong connotation of science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science, addressing intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves the production of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent activity.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to address customer issues and diagnoses, as well as recognition of writing, voice and speech.
These things have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it is integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are very important for any school class. Often, teachers would love to take their students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. From the classroom, students can see museum pieces, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina develop a website about their trip to the state capital. Every year, the website is redesigned, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a memory book.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Because students often start out blogging with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
As students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to strive to improve writing and avoid criticism.
Furthermore, having a blog “forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them.” The need to engage the audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Writing in blogs is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can make students more analytical and critical; by interacting with Internet content in an active way, students can position themselves in the context of others' writings, as well as define their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming and bilingual capital of Canada and boasts a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canadian past and present.
Niagara Falls is further south; the north has the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and much more.
Because of all this and more, Ontario stands out as what outsiders consider the essence of Canada.
Large areas further north are also quite sparsely populated and some are virtually uninhabited.
For a population comparison that surprises many people: there are more African Americans living in the USA than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean, a distance off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent in its own right, when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, which gained a lot of popularity in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their current marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to acts that they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men. Don't be afraid to stand your ground (whether it's due to cultural differences or not, it doesn't mean everything is okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, which was given the name Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco as a whole.
Near the historic part of Medina it is easy to find traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and a lot of other trinkets, all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the far east, near Rwanda.
In the year 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried a large part of the city's streets, especially the center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma should be studied to understand the state of the battle that persists in the Nord-Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of Africa's cheapest gorilla mountain treks.
You can use a boda-boda (mototaxi) to get around in Goma. The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a quick ride.
"Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor to refer to distant and exotic lands, given its relative inaccessibility.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city despite its reputation making it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In the year 1990, it was placed on the list of heritage in danger due to the danger of the desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during the program Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates, broadcast by the PBS channel.
The city contrasts strongly with the rest of the country because it has a more Arab than African feel.
Kruger National Park is located in northeastern South Africa, along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 Km² and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each sustaining different animal species.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
There are fees for entry and conservation of the park, as is the case with all national parks in South Africa.
It can also be very useful to purchase a Wild Card. With it, you can have access to several parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider to be its main attraction.
The parade of buildings that form the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a glittering bar graph that is made visible by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers chose to live in, and so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a great place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they have some of the last great jungles that once covered the remaining Gangetic surface.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², of which a third is covered by water/swamp areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 deer sighted in the area.
There are several bus departure times from the inter-district bus station (across the river) during the day, but most, especially those going east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
As inter-district buses are almost always full, it is advisable to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese coastal minibuses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oiapoque River to connect the cities of Oiapoque, in Brazil, and São Jorge do Oiapoque, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long and have two lanes 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011 and did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to begin operating in September 2017, the date scheduled for the completion of customs inspections in Brazil.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaicurus and the Paiaguás, who lived off hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies", emerged from the encounter of Spanish conquerors with native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has succeeded in preserving many of the characteristics and identity of its indigenous populations.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Tournaments and smaller matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
To stay informed about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands' only bank, which is located in Stanley, opposite FIC West store.
The pound sterling is generally accepted anywhere in the islands and in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are accepted.
In remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currencies may be accepted. Please inquire with the owners in advance to find out what payment method they accept.
It is virtually impossible to change Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so change your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there, while it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical region; in the summer months, temperatures above 30°C are common.
Winter can be disappointingly cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combined make it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains basically the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to the presence of humans, they are still wild animals that should not be fed or disturbed.
Following the instructions of the park authorities, keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
Despite their docile appearance, bison, elk and bears, as well as all large animals, can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't maintain an adequate distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so don't get too close.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling foods and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a well-known naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the US and Britain refused to leave it.
All ships were sunk, with the exception of a British cruiser. Nearly 200 German and American lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the assassination of the supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland being between two bays. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The beaches on the north coast (in the North Harbour district) are bathed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and many have shade from pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the sophisticated suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in the central region of Auckland.
These are sometimes family-friendly beaches packed with a wide variety of shops around the coast. Swimming is very safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One'. It is not a fancy beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called 'Manta'.
There are many French wines to enjoy, but New Zealand and Australian wines can hold their own.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're worried.
For Australians, the concept of a "flat white" coffee is strange. A short black coffee is an "espresso", cappuccinos come with a lot of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The natural juices are expensive, but great.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes that occur on the reef are rare.
Continue to follow the authorities' reminders, obey all signs and pay close attention to safety alerts.
The cubomedusa occurs near beaches and river estuaries from October to April, north of 1770. They can occasionally be found at other times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and tend to swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean. Their main habitat is the estuaries of the rivers that are north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking gives the traveller the peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents usually do business with specific hotels, though it's likely possible to book other types of accommodations, such as campgrounds, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even packages combined with flights and hotels.
They can also secure your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or gather other documents for your destination (e.g., visa).
However, if you have any changes or requests, these should be sent to the travel agent first, and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees decide to camp on site, and most of them consider it a fundamental part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to arrive early to get a camping spot near the music.
Remember that even after the main stage music has ended, some sections of the festival may continue playing late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice generates a terrible noise for the most sensitive.
St. Petersburg cruises include city tours. Passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money spent by their visitors. In general, there are no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and to keep them on the premises.
Some places offer free alcoholic drinks, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Whenever someone is driving in places with high latitudes or on roads over the mountains, they should take into account the possibility of facing snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On roads with ice and snow, the friction is low, and you can't drive as if you were on clean asphalt.
During snowstorms, it is possible to fall enough snow to leave you stuck in a very short time.
Visibility can also be reduced due to falling snow or wind, or condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic remains almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the darling of many visitors.
The term "safari", in its colloquial use, refers to land-based trips to observe the impressive African wildlife, mainly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, have a tendency to approach cars and basic equipment allows for good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, and you will see them better with binoculars.
Also known as "walking in the woods", "walking safari" or "trek", a walking safari is equivalent to walking, whether for a few hours or many days.
The Paralympics will take place between August 24 and September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies did not extend through July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets for the events will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with regular tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Drying wet clothes can help them dry faster. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for loan, even if there isn't one in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you do not like to use damp socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause it to shrink or, in more serious cases, cause burns).
There are different ways to purify water, some more efficient against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling the water for one minute is enough; in others, many minutes are needed.
The quality of filters varies and if you are in doubt, it might be a good idea to consider buying water jugs from a trusted company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests with which they are unfamiliar in the regions they come from.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, at worst, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people through force, usually do not qualify as pests.
Duty free shopping is the chance to buy goods free of taxes and fees in certain locations.
Travelers visiting countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging conditions for drivers on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, who often pass through isolated wilderness areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, use your common sense: steep slopes, narrow lanes and sharp bends are common.
The speed limits posted are noticeably lower than in the preceding and subsequent sections - commonly 55-65 km/h - and strict adherence to them is even more important than the opposite.
Interestingly, however, cell phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, such as in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are very good and, in Bavaria, they are quite elaborate and varied, similar to those of the neighbor to the south, Austria.
Fruit-based sweets are common, with baked apples in sweets all year round, and cherries and plums making an appearance during the summer.
Many German bakery goods also have almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. The famous cakes often go well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small, but tasty sweets, try what, depending on the region, may be called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a smorgasbord that encompasses a wide variety of regional cooking styles found throughout the country.
But, if used without other qualifiers, the term tends to mean that the food is originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes a variety of simply seasoned dishes, the predominant Javanese condiments being peanuts, chilies, sugar (mainly Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
In order for a rider's feet to have support, stirrups are used, which are hung on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but can present safety issues as the rider's feet can become trapped in them.
If a knight is thrown from a horse, but has one of his feet caught in the stirrup, he may be dragged if the animal runs away. To reduce this danger, various safety precautions can be taken
First, a large number of pilots wear riding boots with heels and a smooth sole, which is quite narrow.
Next, some saddles, mainly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a leather stirrup to drop from the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
As the main climbing destination in Chile, the Cochamó Valley is known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The meetings include exciting views of the peaks. Climbers from all over the world are continuously establishing new routes among its infinite potential of cliffs.
Snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding across snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important activity on the trip for many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations just to ski at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old— rock paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century and, in the year 1861, the first recreational ski club was opened by citizens of Norway in Australia.
Ski backpacking: activity also known as skiing in the countryside, touring skiing or ski mountaineering.
It is related, but usually does not involve tourism for alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter done on steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a hiking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly longer distances than on foot – but only very rarely will you be able to achieve the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to go through visa requests and passport control several times.
The Schengen area, however, functions as one country in this respect.
If you stay in this area, it is possible to cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you will not need to apply for visas for each of the Schengen member countries separately, thus saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that specifies which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define items that are more than 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographic variations, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be defined as antiques, although they are younger than similar products produced in mass.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood among the Sámi, and the culture around the trade is also important for many other professional groups.
As much as it is a tradition, not all Sami participated in the large-scale breeding of reindeer, but lived off fishing, hunting and things like that, with reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi work with modern businesses. Tourism is an important income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romani people, the term "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions about the Romani people.
If the country you will be visiting is subject to travel advisories, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
It is also recommended that you consult other governments besides your own, but their advice is for their respective citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Advisories are only a brief summary of the political situation in a nation.
The views presented are usually superficial, general and simplified in relation to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Bad weather is the generic term for any dangerous climatic phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
Bad weather can occur anywhere in the world and encompasses different types, which vary according to geographical location, topography and weather conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation and forest fires are forms and effects of a harsh climate, as well as storms, tornadoes, water spouts and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal weather phenomena include blizzards, as well as snow, ice and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of bad weather in their region, as this may affect travel plans.
When planning a visit to a country that is considered a war zone, first the person must receive professional training.
A search on the internet for 'Hostile Environment Course' will usually indicate the address of a company in the region.
A course will normally cover all the topics discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course usually lasts between 2 and 5 days and involves role-playing, various first aid techniques and, sometimes, weapons training.
Books and magazines that deal with survival in the jungle are common, but publications on war zones are rare.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they are carrying valid documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with an undetermined gender (X), or updated documents to find a desired name and gender, varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is widely variable.
Security checkpoint searches also became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not yet undergone gender reassignment surgery should not have to go through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Return currents are the backwash of wave water on the beach returning to the sea, usually in a reef or similar area.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections, and a rapid current to deep waters can form there.
Most deaths are the result of exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you manage to get out of the current, swimming back is no harder than it would usually be.
Try to aim from somewhere where you can't be caught or, depending on your skills or if you have been detected, wait for rescue.
The re-entry shock occurs before the cultural shock (it takes less time for the honeymoon period to end), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have easily adapted to a new culture sometimes have a special difficulty in readjusting to their native culture.
When returning home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits of your local culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adjust.
People don't realize that patience and understanding are also key for travelers who are returning home.
In the area reserved for children, one of the most interesting things is the light and sound show of the pyramid.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and also in silence before the show starts.
Normally you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The history of sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is defined as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the largest number of bases, with sixteen active ones as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, where the town of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
The others are Livingston Island and Deception, in which the flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, coastal to the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Peninsula here merge into the plateau, then reemerge to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, cut by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, reaching 4,892m at Mount Vinson.
In remote locations with no cell coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone usually does not replace a cell phone, since to make a call you need to be outdoors with a view of the satellite.
The service is often used for transportation, including recreational vessels, as well as expeditions that have remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone operator may be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those who want to take a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among those leaving school, allowing them to take a year out before university without compromising their education.
In most cases, enrolling in a course abroad during a gap year can actually increase your chances of entering higher education in your home country.
There will usually be an enrollment fee to sign up for these educational programs.
For those who enjoy boat trips, Finland is a great destination. In the lakes and coastal archipelagos, the “Land of a Thousand Lakes” also has thousands of islands.
In archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is combined by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but a very characteristic form (for example, in the Netherlands, the number is from one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic town for two full days and return to the ship to sleep at night.
If you only embark on sea excursions, you will not need a separate visa (valid from 2009).
Some cruises advertise Berlin, Germany on their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be a scary experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if those people have never flown before or have never experienced a traumatic event.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's no different from personal fears and dislikes for other things that many people have.
For some, understanding something about how aircraft work and what happens during a flight can help overcome fear based on the unknown or not being in control.
Shipping companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Often, time is of the essence when sending business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
In some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, there was a problem.
If they sent things by air freight, depending on the route, it can take days to get to the landing and go through customs.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked luggage. Airline regulations don't allow them to send luggage without a passenger, which is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is by shelling out a large amount of money for the privilege (or, better still, by getting your company to do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: as a basic rule, you can expect to pay up to four times more for business class and eleven times more for first class compared to the normal economy fare!
In general, it is not worth even looking for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a small group of passengers who are willing to pay a high price for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and in comfort, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The country's language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistria Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member country.
Economic relations have been reestablished between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure in political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with approximately 3.7 million people, and has the second largest port after Istanbul, as well as an excellent transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed and bustling commercial center, located around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide avenues, buildings with glass facades and modern shopping centers are marked by traditional red roofs, the 18th-century market, and the old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that is more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than classic Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the neighboring island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves on people's graves.
It is worth walking around the intriguing village for half an hour.
To the north, and easily accessible, is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners after an exuberant account of its splendors made by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb 403 bus travels frequently to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima (Relicário), a place famous all over the world for Marian apparitions.
Remember that you are basically visiting a huge cemetery, also as a place that has practically incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many living men and women who survived their time here and many others, both Jewish and non-Jewish, whose loved ones were murdered or worked there until death.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not damage the place by staining or cracking the buildings with graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half of the people prefer to speak Catalan, most of them understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, because this is the language that has been established by law as the official language.
Still, Spanish is widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is often just an inadequate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is still good behavior, acting like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will make the trip considerably easier.
The brusque exterior of the Parisian will quickly disappear if you show some basic courtesies
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is highly wooded, mainly with beech, fir, and pine trees, and features a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
There is a remarkable diversity of plant communities, due to the varied microclimates, different soils and different altitude levels.
The area also houses a wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals can be found there, such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wild cats and grouse, as well as several other common species
While visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts covering their knees and also need to have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide clothing for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own clothing, especially in bright colors, you will be greeted with a smile from the monk or nun.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers covering their knees.
You can borrow clothes at the entrance; however, they are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. For men, there is a single size!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in everything.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato and any ingredient available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, along with the word Sie for you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
This also makes reading easier, no doubt, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to figure out whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantivized way.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to be observed are C and G, as their pronunciation varies according to the following vowel.
Also, make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means car.
The Persian language has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar booklet will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand the sentences.
It goes without saying that if you have knowledge of a Romance language, it will be easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak a little Spanish may hastily conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it is not necessary to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are mostly outdated today and remain in museums or schools.
As light pollution was not a problem in their heyday, they tend to be found in cities or university campuses, which are easier to access than more recently built ones.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas that present favorable atmospheric conditions.
The observation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China, where cherry blossoms were the preferred flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look better when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" cutting.
If you visit a formally arranged garden, collecting "specimens" will also get you thrown out, without the right to discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place and very easy to explore, and you can buy almost everything after you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you'll have to deal with both the heat (constant) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, more rarely).
There are also some buses going north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Check if the bus you plan to take goes all the way to Hebron, and not just to the nearby village of Kiryat Arba.
The interior waterways can be a good theme around which to organize a holiday.
For example, visit the castles of the Loire Valley, the Upper Middle Rhine Valley or take a boat trip to the interesting points of the Danube or navigate the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the holiday traditions have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There is a tradition of spending the night of Easter awake in some open place to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may be a pre-Christian Spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend. Congregations often break the celebration at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in Galápagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you are visiting the Arctic or Antarctic areas in the winter, you will experience polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a great opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky gets dark at about the right time.
As the areas are sparsely populated, and consequently light pollution is not a problem, you will also be able to appreciate the stars.
In Japan, cultural labor relations are more based on hierarchy and formality than Westerners are used to seeing.
Suits are the standard dress in business, and colleagues call each other by their surnames or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing group effort rather than individual achievements.
Workers generally need the approval of their superiors for all decisions they make, and are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without question.
