4 words summary
4.1 Overview
The characters in this document are encoded in single, double, or quadruple bytes.
The single-byte part contains all 128 characters from GB/T 11383-1989, from 0x00 to 0x7F.
4.3 Two-byte part
The double-byte part includes all the graphic characters in GB/T 2312-1980, the CJK unified characters in GB/T 13000, and some graphic characters.
The characters in the double-byte portion are specified in Appendix A.
Among them, the graphic description of characters, code positions and functions should conform to the provisions of Appendix B.
Note: GB/T 13000 is a unified code for Chinese characters used in China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam.
Chinese characters with unique abstract shapes are assigned separate code positions; Chinese characters with the same abstract shapes but different origins are assigned shared code positions.
The encoded characters are called CJK Unified Ideographs, where CJK stands for China, Japan, and Korea.
4.4 Four-character part
The four-byte part includes 66 CJK Unified Ideographs in GB/T 13000 (9FA6 to 9FEF, excluding 9FB4 to 9FBB) other than the above two-byte characters, characters in CJK Unified Ideographs Expansion A, characters in CJK Unified Ideographs Expansion BCJK, characters in CJK Unified Ideographs Expansion C, characters in CJK Unified Ideographs Expansion DCJK, and characters in CJK Unified Ideographs Expansion F, as well as characters of ethnic minority scripts already encoded in GB/T 13000.
The characters in the four-character part are defined according to Appendix C.
5 Overall structure
In the main text, the ones preceded by 0x represent hexadecimal, and the ones without 0x represent decimal.
In the appendix, all coded representations are in hexadecimal, and all other representations are in decimal.
The single-byte part uses the coding structure of GB/T 11383-1989, using code points from 0x00 to 0x7F.
The two-byte GONB part represents a character by two eight-bit binary positions, where the first byte code is from 0x81 to 0xFE, and the second byte code is from 0x40 to 0x7E and 0x80 to 0xFE.
The four-byte part uses 0x30 and 0x39, which are not used in GB/T 11383-1989, as a suffix to expand the two-byte encoding, with the encoding range from 0x81308130 to 0xFE39FE39.
The first character of a four-character string is encoded in the range of 0x81 to 0xFE; the second character is encoded in the range of 0x30 to 0x39; the third character is encoded in the range of 0x81 to 0xFE; and the fourth character is encoded in the range of 0x30 to 0x39. That is, 0x81308130 to 0x81308139; 0x81308230 to 0x81308239; 0x8130FEFE30 to 0x8130FE39; 0x81318130 to 0x81318139; “0URo23061393 0xFE39FE30” to 0xFE39FE39.
The overall structure and code position range are shown in Figure 1 and Table 1.

The content of this page is taken from the complete documentation of the GNU C compiler, and is limited to explaining the meaning of options.
Unless someone volunteers to maintain it, the EURo file is the authoritative document.
If you find any discrepancies between the pages and the software, please check the Info
If we find that the content of this manual page is causing significant confusion and complaints because it is outdated, we will stop publishing it. There is no other option, such as updating the Info file while updating the man page, because other work maintaining Gnu cc does not leave us time to do this. The GNU project believes that the man page is an outdated product and should be used elsewhere.
For complete and up-to-date documentation, refer to the Info files `gee' or Using and Porting GNU CC (for version 2.0) (ft&/HAIZE#H GNU CC 2.0) manuals. Both are derived from the original Texinfo file gee. texinfo.
The C and C++ compilers are integrated. They both require one or more of the four steps to process input files: preprocessing, compilation, (assembly) MERE, and linking.
The suffix identifies the language of the source file, but for the compiler, the suffix controls the default settings:
gcc considers the preprocessed file (.i) as a C file and sets the connection in C format,
g++ considers the preprocessed files (.i) as C++ files and sets up the connection in C++ format.
The suffix of the source file indicates the type of language and the post-processing:
.c C source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.C C++ source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.cc C++ source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
. CXX C++ source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.m Objective-C source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.i preprocessed C file; compile, assemble
.ii Preprocessed C++ files; compilation, assembly
.s is the assembly language source program; assembly.
Compile the language source program; preprocessing, compilation
.h preprocessor file; it is usually not shown on the command line. Other files with the same suffix are passed to the linker. They usually include:
.0 Object file
.a Archive file
Unless the -cec, -s, or -E options are used (or a compilation error prevents the entire process), linking is always the final step.
During linking, all the.e files corresponding to the source program, -1 library files, and unrecognizable file names (including specified.o H header files and.a library files) are passed to the linker options in the order specified in the command line.
Options must be given separately: ' is completely different from '-d -r '.
Most of the `=-E: and `-W' options have two opposite formats: -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno-name).
Only the formats that are not the default are listed here.
Below is a summary of all the options, grouped by type, with explanations in the following sections.
Code Generation Option
Overall Option
Specify that the language of the file you are about to enter is language (rather than the default selection derived from the file name).
This option applies to all subsequent input files until the next optional `-x' option .language.
Close any explicit language indication, thus based on the file name after the file RE AS E ` -x' option).
If you only want to operate on a part of the four stages (preprocessing, compilation, assembly, linking), you can use the `-x' option (or the Ah file name) to tell GCC where to start, and `-c', `-s', or `-E' options to tell GCC where to end. Note that some combinations of options (for example, `-x cpp-output -E') tell GCC to compile or assemble the source file, and if ETER. ERA ATI is not specified, GCC will use `.o' to replace the source file name with `.ec' as the target file name. You can use the `-o' option to choose other names. GCC ignores any unrecognizable input after the `-ec' option.
The target file has been deleted.
After compilation, it stops and does not perform assembly.
Work on different stages of the compilation process using pipes instead of temporary files, because the assemblers of those systems cannot read data from pipes, GNU assembler does not have this problem, and the assembler's "dialect" of C that it accepts: it supports C programs that conform to the ANSI standard.
This will close some features in GNU Cc that are not compatible with ANSI Cc, as well as features such as unix and vax that indicate the rarely used ANSI trigraph features, and prohibit the use of the standard libraries even when they are available (for example, when the main function returns an int value, as is typical for almost all programs except for the kernel. In this case, there is no standard library in the independent environment, and the program entry point is not necessarily main. The most obvious example is the operating system kernel. For more information, refer to the latest information on the gcc website).
For function declarations without parameters, such as `int foo ();', C-style is used - that is, no number or type of parameters is specified. (This applies only to C++).
Normally, a function foo like this in C++ means that the parameter is empty.
The节清单 goes on to attempt to support certain aspects of traditional C compilers.
See the NU c manual for details, which we have removed so that people won't HERI when the content becomes outdated.
There is one thing: for C++ programs (not C), the `-traditional' option has an additional effect, allowing this to be assigned.
It is the same as the `-Ethis-is-variable' option.
-traditional-cpp attempts to support some aspects of the traditional C preprocessor.
In particular, the above refers to the preprocessor, but does not include the other effects of the `-traditional' option.
-fdollars-in-identifiers Allows the use of `$' characters in identifiers (C++ only).
You can specify the `-Eno-dollars-in-identifiers' option to indicate that the use of `$' is prohibited.
(GNU C++ allows the `$' character by default on some target systems, but not on all.)
-fenum-int-equiv allows implicit conversions from ant type to enumeration type (MEF C++).
Normally, GNU C++ allows the conversion from enum to int, but not the other way around.
-fexternal-—templates generates smaller code for template declarations (C++ only), by generating a copy of each template function only where it is defined.
To successfully use this option, you must mark `#pragma implementation` (define) or `#pragma interface` (declare) in all files that use the template.
When compiling with the `-fexternal-templates' option, all template instantiations are external types. You must make the necessary instances appear in the implementation files.
This can be achieved through typedef, which references each instance as needed.
Correspondingly, if the default option `-fno-extern-templates` is used at compile time, all template instances are explicitly set as built-in.
All member functions (except constructors and the mnew or delete member operators) are considered virtual functions of their class.
This does not mean that every call to a member function will go through the internal vtable.
In some cases, the compiler can determine that a virtual function can be called directly; in this case, it is called directly.
-fcond-mismatch allows the types of the second and third parameters of the condition expression to be different.
The value of this kind of expression is Void.-fthis-—is-variable, which allows you to assign a value to this (for C++ only).
Merging the user-defined free storage management mechanism into C++ makes the assignable `this` out of place.
Therefore, by default, assigning this inside a class member function is an invalid operation.
However, for backward compatibility, you can make this operation work by using the `-fthis-is-variable' option.
-funsigned-char defines char as an unsigned type, like unsigned char.
All machines have their own default char type, which can be either unsigned char or signed char.
Ideally, when symbolic data dependencies are involved, a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned char.
However, many programs are written to use only simple chars, and this is with a signed number (or unsigned, depending on the target machine the program is written for).
This option, and its inverse, make such programs work on the corresponding default value.
The type of char should always be explicitly defined as signed char or unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly like one of them.
If no `signed' or `unsigned' modifier is explicitly declared, these options define a signed or unsigned bit field, respectively.
By default, the bit fields are signed because the underlying integer types they inherit from, such as int, are signed. However, if the `-traditional' option is specified, the bit fields are always unsigned.
-fwritable-strings stores string constants in writable data segments and does not perform any special treatment.
This is to maintain compatibility with some old programs, and they consider changing the string constant to be a very bad idea, and the `-traditional' option has the same effect.
Executive summary
The impact of COVID-19 on the drug market
Its impact may be similar to the economic crisis in 2008.
The global COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the world into an unprecedented crisis.
In many countries, the disease has overwhelmed healthcare systems, leading to near-collapse, and the restrictions imposed by governments have caused severe disruption to the global economy.
The impact of the epidemic on the drug market is unclear and difficult to predict, but it may be far-reaching.
Some producers may be forced to find new ways to manufacture drugs, as restrictions on movement also limit access to precursors and essential chemicals.
Traffickers may be forced to find new routes and methods due to travel restrictions.
The patterns of drug use and supply may change, and the government's ability to respond may be hindered.
The changes brought about by COVID-19 are unprecedented, but we can still learn from past crises.
After the 2008 economic crisis, some drug users began to look for cheaper synthetic substances and switched to injecting drugs.
At the same time, governments have cut their drug-related budgets.
If governments respond to the current economic downturn in the same way, interventions to prevent drug use and related risky behaviors, as well as drug detoxification and treatment services, may be severely impacted.
In addition, the priority of interception operations and international cooperation may be reduced, making it easier for traffickers to operate.
Some countries have a large amount of drugs smuggled through commercial flights, and it is expected that these countries will be most directly affected by drug trafficking.
Methamphetamine and other synthetic drugs are being smuggled in large quantities in personal bags or hidden in private luggage. As restrictions on air travel have been imposed almost everywhere, the use of commercial air travel to supply drugs may be completely disrupted.
Although the international postal supply chain has also been disrupted, activities involving trafficking through the dark web and shipping of goods are likely to increase.
In the long run, the economic recession and related lockdown measures could disrupt the drug market.
With rising unemployment and lack of opportunities, poor and vulnerable people are more likely to use drugs in a harmful way, develop drug addiction and turn to illicit activities related to drugs, whether production or transportation.
Drug trafficking organizations may take advantage of this situation to provide services to vulnerable people and recruit new members to strengthen their ranks.
As government capacity to respond declines, these shifts are likely to take root quickly, becoming the new reality for many communities.
Expansion and complexity
Market growth
The population growth pattern partly explains the reason for market expansion.
Drug use has been increasing worldwide, both in terms of overall numbers and in the proportion of the world's population that uses drugs.
In 2009, it was estimated that there were 210 million drug users, accounting for 4.8% of the global population aged 15-64. In 2018, it was estimated that there were 269 million drug users, accounting for 5.3% of this population.
Over the past two decades, the growth of drug use in developing countries has far outpaced that in developed countries.
This reflects, to a certain extent, the differences in overall population growth during this period, with 7% in developed countries and 28% in developing countries, but also reflects the faster growth of the young population in developing countries.
Adolescents and young adults account for the largest proportion of drug users.
Between 2000 and 2018, the population in this age group in developing countries grew by 16%, while it decreased by 10% in developed countries.
Urbanization is a driving factor in the current and future drug markets.
In both developed and developing countries, drug use is more prevalent in urban areas than in rural areas.
Part of the reason for the overall increase in drug use is the massive shift of people from rural to urban areas, with more than half of the world's population now living in urban areas, compared to 34% in 1960.
Urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, particularly in developing countries where urbanization is more pronounced.
The increase in wealth is linked to an increase in drug use, but the burden of disease is greatest among the poorest people worldwide, and drug use is more common in developed countries than in developing countries.
Drugs such as cocaine are even more firmly associated with the world's wealthier regions.
Similarly, within countries, the drug use prevalence rate is higher among the wealthy social classes.
However, the rate of conversion to drug addiction is higher among people with lower socioeconomic status.
Data from a few countries suggests that there is a link between harmful drug use patterns and disease and low income.
These patterns seem less common among the wealthier segments of society.
The economic constraints caused by the global COVID-19 crisis are likely to exacerbate the risks faced by the most vulnerable groups, including drug users.
For example, changes in the labor market, such as an increase in unemployment, have traditionally been associated with an increase in drug use, but this pandemic has already caused millions of people around the world to lose their jobs.
The COVID-19 pandemic may lead to further expansion of the drug market. The pandemic may lead to more farmers increasing or engaging in the cultivation of illicit crops, either because the state authorities’ control capacity has decreased or because more people may be forced to take risks and engage in illicit activities in the face of economic crises.
The related restrictions on air and land transportation due to the COVID-19 pandemic may have led to an increase in maritime trafficking, as it is less risky and involves larger quantities than air or land smuggling.
Recently, there have been reports that cocaine is being transported directly from South America to Europe by sea.
Complexity increased.
The situation of non-international controlled substances is stable, but new types of opioids with potential harm are increasing, and the drug market is becoming more complex.
In addition to plant substances such as marijuana, cocaine and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control. The non-medical use of drugs is also rapidly increasing.
There are about 500 new active substances on the domestic market of member countries every year.
Currently, most of them are stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid agonists and a small amount of opioids.
Although the total number of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportion has changed.
Among the total number of new psychoactive substances identified in 2014, only 2% were new psychoactive substances of the opioid type, but this figure had risen to 9% by 2018.
Many of the new psychoactive substances in the opioid family are similar to fentanyl, and their effects and dangers have been proven, leading to overdose deaths in North America and to a lesser extent in other regions.
In North America, fentanyl is used as a cutting agent for heroin and other drugs, including cocaine and methamphetamine, and is also used to make counterfeit pharmaceutical opioids.
Some evidence suggests that there is also injection of new psychoactive substances in Europe: a study of waste from syringes in six European cities found that many of the syringes contained new psychoactive substances that produce a high.
The use of new psychoactive substances may gradually become entrenched among vulnerable groups.
New psychoactive substances of a single type have almost never formed a large market.
But evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among marginalized groups such as the homeless and prison inmates.
Twenty-two countries reported the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, with synthetic cannabinoids identified as the main challenge in most of them.
The regulation of precursor chemicals has forced drug makers to innovate. Many chemicals that were once used as precursors to manufacture amphetamines, methamphetamines and "ecstasy" have been placed under international control.
Drug traffickers and manufacturers have been looking for alternatives, not only substances with less regulation, but also chemicals specifically designed to evade regulation, known as "tailor-made precursors."
Restrictive measures aimed at stopping the spread of COVID-19 are likely to put further pressure on drug makers who rely on precursor chemicals.
Evidence from Mexico suggests this is already a reality: in March 2020, a shortage of methylphenidate precursors imported from East Asia reportedly drove up prices of methylphenidate in Mexico and the United States.
The market is constantly changing.
Synthetic drugs replace opioids in Central Asia and the Russian Federation
The opioid market in Central Asia and the Russian Federation appears to have changed between 2008 and 2018.
The quantity of opiates intercepted by the authorities of the Russian Federation has decreased by about 80%, while the number of people receiving treatment for opiate use has decreased significantly.
But the market for performance-enhancing drugs seems to be thriving.
There is evidence that methamphetamine and various cathinones, including ephedrine and a-pyrrolidinopentiophenone, are now readily available on the Russian drug market.
Russian authorities reported that the number of secret manufacturing sites for various illicit drugs seized recently has risen sharply, more than doubling in two years, reaching 152 sites in 2018.
Methamphetamine markets grow in Afghanistan and Iraq
As early as 2012, surveys of people in hospitals, prisons and other institutions had revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.
Crystal methamphetamine has become another major drug of concern, in addition to "fenethylline" and quomodone.
A 2015 study further confirmed these findings, with drug users saying marijuana was harder to obtain than "Percocet" or methamphetamine.
Recently, Iraqi authorities have discovered multiple methamphetamine processing sites, and the International Narcotics Control Board has expressed concern about the large import of pseudoephedrine drugs, which are used as precursors in methamphetamine processing.
In Afghanistan, methamphetamine manufacturing appears to have started in 2014.
Since then, seizures of methamphetamine have been steadily increasing.
However, the seizure volume in the first half of 2019 was 657 kg - a significant increase compared to the previous year.
Large quantities of methamphetamine believed to originate from Afghanistan have been seized in other countries, indicating that production in that country is rapidly increasing.
Policy changes and trends of change
The majority of jurisdictions that have legalized the non-medical use of marijuana have seen an increase in its use.
Eleven jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay and the United States allow the production of cannabis products for non-medical use.
In most of these jurisdictions, cannabis use has increased since it was legalized, although the same trend has been observed in other jurisdictions that have not legalized non-medical cannabis use.
In Colorado and Washington, the two states that first passed legislation on marijuana use, the number of adults using marijuana without medical purposes has increased, especially in the past month and on a daily or almost daily basis, and has exceeded the national average since 2012.
All indicators show that marijuana use has increased in Uruguay since 2011, and last month it almost doubled.
This indicates that the main reason for the increase is the regular and frequent use of cannabis.
Short-term data from Canada also shows that while the legal market expanded from 2018 to 2019, use was also increasing.
However, in 2019, 40% of marijuana users still obtained some products from illegal sources.
Is the reason behind the sharp drop in global cannabis herb seizures the legalization of cannabis?
In 2018, global cannabis herb seizures fell to their lowest level in 20 years, due to a decline in seizures in North America, which fell by 84% over the past decade.
In comparison, seizures in other parts of the world have almost doubled during the same period. The pattern of seizures suggests that policies aimed at liberalizing the marijuana market have played a key role in the increase.
The regulation of new psychoactive substances seems to have a deterrent effect, but it is still difficult to assess the effectiveness of the regulation of new psychoactive substances in China.
Some countries that have different regulatory systems for new psychoactive substances show different prevalence rates of use of new psychoactive substances.
In other countries, the use of new psychoactive substances has decreased after domestic legislation was passed.
Weak populations face the harm of both legal and illegal drug markets, and opioids used for pain management and palliative care are mainly provided in high-income countries. The distribution of painkillers is uneven across regions.
In 2018, more than 90% of all pharmaceutical opioids available for medical use were in high-income countries.
About 50% are in North America, 40% in Europe, and 2% in Oceania.
These countries account for about 12% of the global population.
It is estimated that the population of low- and middle-income countries accounts for 88% of the global population, but consumes less than 10% of the pharmaceutical opioids.
Obstacles to obtaining opioids are related to many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems, and prescribing practices.
People in poorer areas are more at risk of drug addiction. In 2018, around 35.6 million people were addicted to drugs.
Poverty, limited education, and social marginalization may increase the risk of and exacerbate the consequences of drug addiction, as confirmed by studies in high-income countries. In these studies, the adverse socioeconomic trajectories of individuals are not only related to their conditions at a certain point in time, but also to the risk of drug addiction.
Drug addiction also deepens socio-economic disadvantage, increasing the risk of unemployment, poverty and homelessness, thereby fuelling a vicious cycle. These outcomes may also be related to stigmatizing attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.
Women, ethnic minorities and migrants, sexual and gender diverse groups, people displaced by armed conflict or disasters, and those living in rural environments may also be disproportionately affected by drug use disorders or face challenges in accessing treatment services.
According to the disability-adjusted life years (DALY) indicator, which estimates the number of healthy years of life lost due to disability and premature death, harmful drug use has had a wider social impact over the past 10 years.
From 2007 to 2018, the global disability-adjusted life years attributable to drug use increased by 17%.
The increase in the number of years of life with a disability associated with hepatocellular carcinoma caused by untreated hepatitis C among injecting drug users is particularly high - up to 40%.
The relationship between drugs and violence is complex, and it is difficult to establish a causal link between the use of psychoactive substances and violence.
Limited data from around the world suggests that intoxication may be a significant factor in homicides.
But in violent incidents, alcohol seems to play a bigger role than drugs.
While drug use may lead to crime, in some cases this link can be partly attributed to a range of intervening factors, such as socio-economic disadvantage, and other types of adversity, such as individual risk factors, family environment and peer influences.
The connection between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.
If there is a stable criminal structure, large-scale organized criminal activities, including international drug trafficking, can be carried out without violence.
In the short term, the existence and intensity of violence is more dependent on changes that destabilize the balance of power between organized crime groups, such as changes in the size of the illegal market, the death or imprisonment of well-known criminals, and law enforcement measures that weaken one group and strengthen another.
Latest trends
Marijuana is the most commonly used substance, and opioids are the most dangerous.
It is estimated that 192 million people used cannabis in 2018, making it the most widely used drug in the world.
By comparison, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.
However, the related hazards of opioids are ignored due to their low usage.
Of the estimated 167,000 deaths related to drug use in 2017, 66% were caused by these substances, and 50% of the estimated 21 million years of life lost due to disability or premature deaths believed to be caused by drug use were caused by these substances.
The non-medical use of synthetic opioids has exacerbated the public health crisis
In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, the crisis is aggravated by methadone; in North America, it is fentanyl. These two regions have almost nothing in common in terms of economic, demographic, or general drug use patterns, but they are both struggling to combat the opioid crisis fueled by easily accessible and inexpensive substances.
In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has led to a surge in opioid overdose deaths over the past two decades.
In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths registered in the United States involved fentanyl.
Canada also reported similar results, but with lower numbers.
Part of the reason that fentanyl causes overdose deaths is the unpredictable potency of fentanyl in the illicit drug market.
In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, the market for non-medical use of khat has grown significantly.
In the region, more and more patients with the disease are seeking treatment in Qomado.
In 2017, the global seizure of fentanyl increased significantly, reaching a peak of more than 125 tons.
However, in 2018, after India passed a new law to regulate ketamine, global seizures dropped to 32 tons.
The crises in these two locations were caused by the manufacture of simple and low-cost products, as well as the lack of international regulation of ketamine and many other similar substances or their precursors.
The crisis in these two regions is worsened by the fact that these substances are available on both the pharmaceutical and illicit markets, making it more difficult to detect and prevent their abuse.
The use of drugs is increasing.
The area of drugs of abuse is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are increasing in use in their main markets.
About 19 million people used cocaine in 2018, as cocaine is popular in North America and Western Europe.
About 27 million people used amphetamines in the same year, with methamphetamine being the most commonly used amphetamine-type stimulant in Southeast Asia and North America.
According to most indicators available, methamphetamine use has been expanding in both regions for the past 20 years.
In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist and sometimes even substitute each other, with the use of one drug rising as the use of the other falls, and sometimes both increasing and decreasing to meet the demands of the same market.
COVID-19 increases the risk for injecting drug users
It is estimated that there were about 11.3 million people who injected drugs in 2018, and about 10% of global HIV infections were caused by injecting drugs.
More than 1 million injection drug users are infected with HIV, and 5.5 million have hepatitis C.
In 2017, about 585,000 people died of drug overdose, half of whom died of liver disease caused by hepatitis B. Most of the injecting drug users with hepatitis B have not been treated.
The shortage of opioids caused by the COVID-19 restrictions may lead users to substitute them with more readily available substances such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or to mix opioids with synthetic drugs.
As some users switch to injecting or injecting more frequently, more harmful use patterns may emerge.

EU summit debates refugee policy, EU officials: reception process faces bottlenecks - www.chinanews.com
EU summit is in constant dispute over refugee policy; EU officials: every step of the reception process is a bottleneck
[Reporter of the Global Times stationed in Belgium, Ni Ruifeng] According to a report by AFP on February 10, at the latest EU summit on that day, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said that the EU leaders agreed to adopt stricter policies on illegal immigration, making it easier to expel illegal immigrants.
This move by the EU is reportedly in response to growing concerns over illegal immigration in Europe, where the core issue now is that the number of illegal immigrants who can ultimately be repatriated is very small.
According to the summit document, EU leaders called on the Commission to "immediately mobilize a significant amount of EU funds" to strengthen external borders with infrastructure and surveillance measures.
However, the EU and its member states have been arguing over issues such as the cost of the fence.
Von der Leyen has repeatedly stated that EU funds will not pay for the costs involved.
However, some diplomats from member countries said that if the EU could share the cost of installing cameras, observation towers and other infrastructure along its external borders, it would free up national budgets and speed up the construction process.
The European Euractiv website reported that EU officials admitted that every step in the refugee reception process was facing bottlenecks, and the limited reception capacity and overburdened immigration authorities in member states could not stop refugees from submitting "countless" asylum applications in EU countries, and the EU's refugee reception system was in a near-permanent crisis.
According to the European Commission, the Schengen countries in the EU received more than 920,000 asylum applications last year, nearly half more than the previous year.
At the same time, the EU recorded more than 330,000 illegal entries last year.
In this context, the summit also agreed on a "principle" that EU countries can deport illegal immigrants back to their home countries based on the judgments of the courts of another member country.
In addition, the report states that EU leaders also agreed to "increase the use of the concept of safe countries", which will pave the way for the EU to establish a common list.

The United States’ escalation of the “chip war” has dealt a heavy blow to the global semiconductor industry - www.chinanews.com
Recently, the United States has been escalating its “chip war” with China – first, the Netherlands and Japan, under pressure from the United States, agreed to launch controls on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China; later, foreign media reported that the United States government is considering cutting off all links between US suppliers and Huawei, banning US suppliers from providing any products to Huawei; the Biden administration is also preparing to announce an executive order to limit US investment in sensitive Chinese technology industries… As soon as the new year begins in 2023, the United States will continue to use bad tactics to curb the development of China’s semiconductor-related industries.
In recent years, the United States has never stopped its efforts to suppress China's semiconductor development. While it has accurately suppressed the semiconductor supply chain in China, it has also built a "de-China" alliance in the semiconductor industry chain, aiming to completely "leave China behind" in the advanced semiconductor industry.
Whether it is to form a “technology alliance” with South Korea or a “semiconductor alliance” with South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, or to establish a “semiconductor industry circle” through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QSD) mechanism or the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) mechanism, the United States is trying to build a closed supply chain circle dominated by the United States by introducing political, partisan and weaponized means into the semiconductor industry, in order to make up for its shortcomings in the field of semiconductor manufacturing and maintain its leading position in the global semiconductor industry.
However, the United States' aggressive "chip warfare" against China is also "injuring the enemy while harming oneself".
Recently, the well-known chip manufacturing equipment supplier, the Panasonic Group, announced that it would lay off 1,300 full-time employees due to the latest round of export bans on chip manufacturing equipment to China, and plans to lay off 1,400 temporary employees in the next two quarters.
The Dutch ASML, a global leader in lithography machines, recently warned that banning the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to a rise in semiconductor prices.
According to media analysis in the United States, after the US government imposed arbitrary sanctions on the semiconductor and other industries in China, many US companies have suffered, including developers of electronic design automation tools, chip designers, manufacturers of wafer manufacturing equipment, and chip manufacturers themselves.
The so-called suppression of China's advanced semiconductor industry by the United States has dragged down the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain.
The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, and a closely connected global semiconductor industry chain has already formed.
According to estimates by professionals, based on specialized division of labor, the entire production process of semiconductor products needs to cross borders more than 70 times across different countries, and the whole process takes 100 days.
Although the semiconductor industry in the United States is relatively strong in terms of its foundation, it is weak in terms of manufacturing capabilities, especially advanced process technologies, and is heavily dependent on the East Asian region.
Even if the United States tries to steer the advanced chip supply chain towards the “closed” regional development dominated by the United States, the regional distribution and interdependence of the global semiconductor industry will be difficult to change.
The United States has vigorously “reformed” the semiconductor industry chain to “de-China” it, which has severely damaged the global semiconductor industry.
Chips are the core of the future global industry, and the development of the chip industry cannot be achieved without the joint participation of all countries in the world.
In recent years, the United States has taken a series of unilateral actions, successively issuing the Innovation and Competition Act, the American Competition Act of 2022, and the Chips and Science Act, using technological hegemony to consolidate its technological superiority; it has also used "carrots and sticks" to coerce chip manufacturing companies such as Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, and Samsung to set up factories in the United States, in order to ensure the United States' global leadership in the field of chips.
In the short term, the United States has indeed created trouble for China's semiconductor industry and related industries, and has reaped real benefits.
In the long run, however, the United States’ excessive suppression will force China’s semiconductor industry to continue to break through, causing the United States to lose a huge Chinese market, which will ultimately greatly weaken the innovation willingness and ability of American technology companies and harm the development of the global semiconductor industry.

First batch of personal pension investment products launched, with a holding period of as little as 360 days - www.chinanews.com
First batch of personal pension investment products launched
7 products from the same institution can be selected, and the shortest holding period is 360 days.
Personal pension financial products have finally been launched.
On February 10, China Finance Network released the first list of personal pension investment products, and 7 personal pension investment products from Bank of China Finance, Agricultural Bank of China Finance, and China Postal Savings were officially launched.
At this point, the "shelves" of personal pension accounts have finally been filled with four types of products: personal pension savings, personal pension investment management, personal pension insurance, and publicly-offered personal pension funds.
It was reported that the first batch of personal pension investment products are all publicly offered net asset value-based open-end products, including 5 newly issued products and 2 existing products. Except for one product that is a mixed type product, the other 6 products are all fixed income products.
The reporter from Beijing Youth Daily found that 4 out of the 5 new products were from Bank of Communications Wealth Management, and they were all fixed-income products with holding periods of 365 days, 540 days, 720 days, and 1080 days, respectively, and the corresponding performance benchmarks (annualized) were 3.70%-4.20%, 4.10%-4.60%, 4.40%-4.90%, and 5.25%-5.75%.
The remaining new product is “Postal Savings Wealth Adds Joy Hengqin No. 1 Short-term 1095 Days”, which is also a fixed-income product. It started collecting funds on February 10 and ended on February 19. Its risk level is level 2.
Of the two surviving products, one is Agricultural Bank of China Wealth Management’s “Agricultural Bank of China Unity·Dynamic” 360-day technology innovation RMB wealth management product, which is of a mixed nature and has a risk level of three.
Another surviving product is “Postal Savings Wealth Add Life Hengqin No. 1 with a minimum holding period of 365 days”, of the fixed income type, which started collecting funds on December 30 last year and officially started operating on January 4 this year. Its cumulative net value on February 8 was 1.0011.
According to the Opinions of the State Council on Promoting the Development of Individual Pension Insurance, the financial products that individual pension fund accounts can invest in include bank wealth management products, savings deposits, commercial pension insurance, and publicly offered funds.
The launch of the first personal pension investment products marks the official start of personal pension investors being able to purchase investment products through their personal pension fund accounts.
In November last year, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission formulated the Interim Measures for the Management of Personal Pension Business of Commercial Banks and Asset Management Companies.
The Measures stipulate that participants can purchase personal pension products such as personal pension savings, personal pension investment products, personal pension insurance products, and publicly offered personal pension fund products through their personal pension fund accounts.
Subsequently, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the Ministry of Finance, and the State Administration of Taxation issued a notice, clarifying that the individual pension system will be implemented in 36 pilot cities and regions, including Beijing and Tianjin, as well as Shijiazhuang in Hebei Province and the Xiongan New Area.
As of the end of 2022, there were 19.54 million participants in individual pension plans, with 6.13 million people paying premiums, with a total premium amount of 14.2 billion yuan.
Previously, banks participating in the pilot only offered three types of products: personal pension savings, personal pension insurance products, and publicly-offered pension funds.
Now that personal pension investment products have gathered together, how should investors choose?
According to experts from the product development department of ICBC Wealth Management, compared with other personal pension products, the pilot phase of the pension wealth management products and personal pension wealth management products have three characteristics.
One is stability, with a more robust risk management mechanism, more stable investment strategies and concepts, and the implementation of independent third-party custody by non-parent banks.
Second, it is long-term. The duration of pilot period old-age financial products is 5 years or more, and the minimum holding period for individual old-age financial products to be issued in the future is 1 year, with a preference for holding periods of 3 years or more.
Third, it is inclusive. The purchase threshold of products is low, with a starting point of 1 yuan, and some as low as 0.01 yuan. The custody fees, management fees, and other fees for the products are also more favorable.
Professionals pointed out that investors should choose according to the characteristics of the products and their own risk tolerance.
Individual pension savings have the characteristics of long-term duration, high interest rates, and high safety; they are suitable for people with low risk tolerance; individual pension insurance products focus on protection, and are suitable for people who cannot bear investment risks and can accept stable returns; while individual pension investment products and publicly offered fund products have no guarantee of principal or returns, and have certain investment risks, but have high expected returns and are suitable for people with certain financial knowledge and high risk tolerance.

The fitness industry should overcome the crisis of trust - www.chinanews.com
Another large gym “defaults”?
Recently, the issue of member rights protection at the well-known fitness institution, Zhongxin Fitness, has attracted social attention.
After the Spring Festival, many members found that their local stores were not operating normally. Subsequently, rumors about the bankruptcy and absconding of the institution caused panic among the members, leading to the involvement of public security and human resources departments.
Finally, the relevant person in charge of the agency came forward to respond, promising to do their best to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of employees and members, and the controversy was thus resolved.
Some gyms have temporarily closed due to operational problems, and consumers could have waited calmly for the problems to be resolved. Why is the first reaction of many members to this situation “something is wrong”?
The dispute over the rights of fitness club members is a symptom of a deeper crisis of trust in the industry.
Domestic traditional gyms generally adopt a prepaid model, and “making money from customers who don’t come” is the underlying logic of their development.
Obtaining cash flow through pre-selling membership cards and opening new stores seems to be a cycle, but in reality, it is like eating the rice of others, and it is impossible to form a stable profit model.
Negative news such as gyms going bankrupt is being reported frequently, which has a strong impact on consumer confidence.
In terms of market prospects, gyms are certainly a good business with a “promising future”.
Although the fitness industry has its ups and downs, it has always been a focus of capital.
Multiple data show that the popularity of cultural and sports consumption has been rising, and the market is continuing to recover.
Specifically in the fitness market, as the living standard of residents has been steadily improving, the concept of a healthy lifestyle has become deeply rooted in people’s minds, and the fitness industry has great potential for development.
The better the situation, the more the industry needs to pay attention to the quality of development.
However, some institutions are overly optimistic about the fitness market after the recovery in consumption, and have just come out of the crisis, and are now sounding the call to expand, throwing all their financing into new store construction.
It cannot be denied that in recent years, many institutions have withdrawn due to the impact of the pandemic, and the industry has undergone a reshuffle. At this time, powerful enterprises choose to increase their acquisition efforts and reorganize, which is undoubtedly a new opportunity.
However, in order for the fitness market to develop and enter into a virtuous cycle, and to embark on a prosperous path, the industry must change its traditional model and business strategy.
Only by persevering and re-establishing consumer trust and security can we truly win the market and win the future.
Compared to grabbing market share like Big Chill, what the fitness industry needs most right now is to calm down and optimize its services, and to stabilize users through high-quality development.
First of all, we need to rely on services to retain users.
Gyms belong to the service industry, and their essence is to adhere to the “user orientation”, focusing on improving the quality of services around the needs of users.
Secondly, digital transformation is the key to improving user experience.
For example, the popular Internet gym model nowadays allows users to pay per session and choose their own gym.
At the same time, the effective use of body data and exercise data can also meet social needs and realize a complete service loop from online to offline.
Without private sales and huge annual fees, users’ concerns about gyms “running away” are reduced, and their trust in the gyms is increased.
In addition, we should actively explore multiple business models.
Nowadays, sports consumption has moved from single services to scenario consumption, and fitness clubs are expected to become a new entry point for consumption. Surrounding products such as sports supplements and fitness equipment required for exercise may become new profit points, providing consumers with more choices.

Nanjing real estate market sees “price compensation” again - www.chinanews.com
Report by Yangzi Evening News (reporter: Ma Zhuopo): In an interview on the 10th, reporters from Yangzi Evening News/Zi Niu News found that the “guaranteed price agreement” that had not been seen for more than a decade has returned to the Nanjing real estate market. A property in the Jiangbei New Area claimed “difference compensation”, where the discount for other properties is greater than the previous discount before the keys are handed over, and the developer is willing to switch properties for buyers and refund the difference.
The conditions of the “price protection agreement” are not few.
The property, located in Jiangbei New District, is called Poli Yanzi Cuiyun Taiji and the person looking at the property, Mr. Sun, told the reporter that he found a “statement” during his visit to the property last weekend.
The pictures he sent to the reporter showed that the developer of the property promised that if the buyer purchased the property between February 1 and February 28, the developer would switch the property and refund the difference in price if the discount of the other properties in the project was greater than the discount enjoyed by the buyer at the time of purchase (limited to other unsold properties of the same floor plan, building, unit, and property type as the property in question).
Mr. Sun said that the real estate consultant said that this was actually a “price protection agreement” aimed at reassuring buyers that they did not need to worry about the developer reducing the price for promotional purposes. “Now, we are afraid that the price will be reduced after we buy it. We don’t have time to go to the sales office and cause trouble, but it is indeed reassuring not to worry about it.”
Many home buyers also believe that the “price guarantee agreement” is a good deal, even though it is meant to reassure home buyers.
Ms. Zheng, who intends to buy a house for her basic needs in Jiangbei, said that the properties with guarantees must be of the same type and in the same building and unit. There are very few properties for buyers to compare, so the “threshold” is quite high.
Some buyers also believe that due to information asymmetry, it is not impossible that additional discounts will be given during the sale, making it difficult for buyers to “stand up for their rights”.
Whether it will be able to retain home buyers remains to be seen.
When the reporter searched for the property on the Nanjing online real estate website, he found that the project sold 252 units in two buildings in November last year, with floor areas of 105 square meters, 114 square meters, and 129 square meters, and the average selling price of fully furnished units was 39,843 yuan/square meter.
However, more than two months have passed, and according to online real estate, the total number of unsold units in the project is currently 157, accounting for 62.3%, of which 80 units are in Building 8, with a total of 113 unsold units, and 44 units in Building 7, out of a total of 124 units; the total number of units sold in the project is only 33, accounting for only 13%.
Market insiders said that "price guarantee agreements" had also appeared in Nanjing in 2008.
In August of that year, Lvtanxiyuan, a housing project on Huangshan Road in Heqing, launched a "price guarantee plan" to attract buyers. The specific content of the plan was "the company solemnly promises that if the discount range of the project is expanded within one year, the company will refund the difference to the old owners."
After that, in April 2011, nine projects in Nanjing also promised to compensate for the difference in price by offering some of their units.
“The property market is recovering, and we need a ‘stimulant’ at this time.
“Shen, a senior property developer in Nanjing, said that ‘price guarantee agreements’ are also one of the marketing methods of property developers.
He believes that developers need more confidence than home buyers at present, and the introduction of the "price guarantee agreement" is actually meant to boost their confidence.
As for whether the buyers will stay, he said that it depends on the impact of multiple factors such as the control policies and loan thresholds, and it is still to be observed at present.
Multiple data declines, Taiwan's economic performance in the first quarter is poor - www.chinanews.com
Xinhua News Agency, Taipei, February 11 (reported by Zhao Bo and Huang Yanyan) - Export trade volume has been “five consecutive months of decline”, the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) has contracted for seven consecutive months, and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has seen “three-digit inflation”… Recently, the Taiwan authorities have released economic data for January 2023.
Experts analyzed that Taiwan's economy had a poor start to the year and faced significant growth pressure.
According to the financial affairs authority of the Taiwan authorities, the exports of the Taiwan region amounted to US$31.51 billion in January this year, a year-on-year decrease of 21.2%, and a negative growth for the fifth consecutive month.
The export volume of 11 major export commodities all showed a decline compared with the same period last year.
Rubber and plastic products and optical instruments fell the most, with year-on-year decreases of 37.6% and 35.7%, respectively.
Exports of electronic components decreased by 20.1% year-on-year, the largest decline in the past 11 years.
Among them, the annual decline in integrated circuits was 18.3%, the largest drop in 14 years.
Cai Meina, head of statistics at the department, said this shows the weakening demand effect in the consumer electronics industry, indicating that the electronics industry is entering a period of adjustment.
Statistics show that in January, imports and exports of Taiwan fell simultaneously, with outbound shipments amounting to only US$2.34 billion, the lowest level in nearly three years.
The Taiwan authorities in charge of finance believe that global end-demand has decreased, and the adjustment of industry inventory has suppressed the willingness of manufacturers to purchase raw materials. The export slump is unlikely to improve in the short term, and Taiwan’s exports in the first quarter of this year are expected to decline more than anticipated.
According to the Taiwan China Economic Research Institute, the Taiwan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was 40.4% in January this year, down 3.3 percentage points from December last year, and has contracted for seven consecutive months.
In the economic monitoring indicator system, the PMI is set at 50% as the demarcation line between prosperity and contraction, with an index greater than 50% representing prosperity expansion and vice versa.
Among the five components of the Taiwan PMI, new orders, production and tightened employment of labor, supplier delivery time and tightened inventory were all down in January.
All six industries returned a PMI contraction, with the order of contraction rates being the power and mechanical equipment industry (35.1%), the electronic and optical industry (35.2%), the chemical and biotech medical industry (39.2%), the basic raw materials industry (42.4%), the transportation industry (42.6%), and the food and textile industry (45.7%).
In terms of prices, the “Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics” of the Taiwan authorities announced that the CPI of Taiwan in January this year was 3.04%, which has exceeded 3% since July last year.
Among them, the price of vegetables soared by 28.25%, setting a new high in 17 months.
Cai Zhihong, a special commissioner from the Taiwan “Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics”, admitted that the increase in vegetable prices was beyond expectations, excluding the factors of the Chinese New Year. The average CPI in January and February of this year should be close to 2.71% of last December, and inflation pressure still exists and is at a high level.
Looking ahead to Taiwan’s economy this year, experts are pessimistic based on reports from domestic media outlets such as United Daily News and Yahoo Finance.
According to analysis by Wu Daijiang, a professor at the Economics Department of “Central University” in Taiwan, the decline in exports may cause cash flow problems for export manufacturers and increase the risk of debt default.
At the same time, the reduction in orders leads manufacturers to cut labor costs, which affects the labor market and family finances, and in turn affects consumer spending power.
Qiu Dasheng, a researcher at the Taiwan Economic Research Institute, believes that the inflation situation in Europe and the United States has not improved, and demand continues to shrink. It is estimated that the decline in Taiwan's exports will continue into the first half of the year.
As Taiwan's economy relies on exports, the impact of the sluggish exports will result in lower economic growth performance for the whole year than last year.
“An important engine of global recovery” - chinanews.com
“In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese economy has shown great resilience.
Recent market expectations indicate that the international community generally has confidence in China's future development.
"José Luis, a well-known Chinese affairs expert in Spain and honorary consultant of China Policy Watch, said in an interview with our reporter that the current phase of China's epidemic prevention and control has entered a new stage, and the vitality of economic and social development will be further unleashed.
Liu said that in the face of various unexpected factors, China has calmly responded with remarkable economic governance experience and measures, which fully demonstrate its economic resilience and management level.
While China is firmly committed to expanding its opening-up, the internal driving force of economic development is continuously strengthening, and state-owned enterprises and private enterprises are developing in tandem.
Every year, the National Two Sessions are held in China, where representatives and delegates discuss the country’s development plans and hot-button issues related to people’s livelihoods, and broadly consolidate consensus, unite people’s hearts and minds, and gather wisdom, adding strength to China’s development.
“Since the reform and opening up, China has achieved long-term high-speed development and has now entered the stage of high-quality development.
The international community expects China’s wisdom and China’s solutions, and expects China’s development to bring new opportunities to the world.
"At present, China is making every effort to promote technological innovation and inject new impetus into economic and social development," said Reos. "Investment in funds, talent training, and policy incentives have made China continue to be full of vitality in its new five-year plan."
In the eyes of Liu, economic system reform is a daunting task for any country.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, China has made use of the advantages of the market economy while leveraging the superiority of the socialist system, and has taken proactive measures to stabilize the economy.
Around the strategic base of expanding domestic demand, China will strengthen financial support for the real economy, support the development of private enterprises, small and medium-sized enterprises and the manufacturing industry, adhere to innovative development, promote employment, increase the income and living standards of the Chinese people, and meet the diverse consumption needs of the people. By fully, accurately and comprehensively implementing the new development concept, China will strive to promote high-quality development and build a new development pattern, which will bring more growth opportunities to the world.
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the proposal of the Belt and Road Initiative.
“The stabilization and recovery of the economy after the epidemic is a common goal of the international community.
China's economic development potential will continue to be unleashed, bringing more benefits to countries around the world and becoming an important engine for global recovery.
Liu said that he looked forward to the joint construction of the Belt and Road Initiative continuing to play its important role in improving the infrastructure level of various countries and strengthening interconnectivity in various fields, and continuing to unleash greater potential.

Henan Province standardizes and integrates the prices of dental implant medical services - www.chinanews.com
CCTV News: Dental implants are the ideal choice for many toothless patients, but the price of tens of thousands of yuan per tooth has always deterred many patients.
Since this year, with the accelerated implementation of the procurement of dental implants, various places have also put the reduction of dental implant prices on the agenda.
Since February 10, the price control target for a single conventional implant dental service in Henan Province is 4,300 yuan, and the total cost of a single conventional implant should not exceed 97% of the control target.
Tooth implantation refers to a method of tooth restoration in which the upper part of the restoration is supported and fixed by the lower structure that is implanted in the bone tissue.
Reporters learned from Zhengzhou University Affiliated Hospital No. 1 that the price for a single conventional implant, from planting to final repair, is about 16,700 yuan.
Patient He Ying: After the new policy, the doctor told me that for a case like mine, it would cost about 8,000 yuan or less, which is basically half the price.
Based on the existing projects, Henan Province has integrated 15 medical service price items for oral implantation, including “implantation fee (per tooth)”, and formulated a unified price for public medical institutions under provincial administration and a payment category for medical insurance, cancelling or adjusting 20 medical service price items, such as dental implantation.
Li Yunjie, Director of the Pharmaceutical Price and Tendering Procurement Department of Zhengzhou Bureau of Medical Insurance: The main beneficiaries are the four parties: medical insurance, which will have lower expenses; hospitals, which will have less pressure; patients, who will have more treatment options; suppliers, who will have a market; and patients, who will benefit the most, as the cost of dental implants may be reduced by half or even more.

The Chinese e-commerce industry has emerged with "new variables", how can merchants achieve "content as king"?
- China News Service
Xinhua News Agency, February 11, 2019 -- Title: "New variables" emerge in China's e-commerce industry; how to make "content king" in product promotion?
CNCE Journalist Xia Bin
“We entered the e-commerce market late, but from the very beginning we realized that content is important if you want to stand out from the millions of stores.
Fangfang, a “90s” girl from Guangdong, is now running a health food store on TikTok and has helped a brick-and-mortar store with over 30 years of history “bloom” online.
By imitating the style of old Hong Kong movies and pairing it with classic Cantonese songs, opening the Douyin account of @Fangfang1PersonFood, the exquisite videos are a breath of fresh air.
Recently, at the Douyin e-commerce event "Find Peers·Share Quality Content", Fangfang attended as a representative of quality creators to share her experiences and insights on daily creative work.
She said on the spot, “The carefully edited video has attracted a lot of attention from netizens, many of whom are interested in the ingredients in my family’s dishes and want to cook them together with us, which has suddenly opened up a market for us.
”
Fangfang used the soup video to make more people fall in love with the "taste of Laoguang", and in one live broadcast, she sold up to 300,000 packets of nourishing ingredients, saving the family store on the brink of bankruptcy.
“No content, no e-commerce”, as short videos and live e-commerce continue to develop, people’s requirements and standards for e-commerce content are entering a new stage.
In the early days of live-streaming sales, live broadcasts often used low discounts to attract users, and price advantage seemed to be the only selling point at the time.
In recent years, there have been phenomenal big Vs such as Liu Yihong and Dongfang Zhenzhu, as well as many non-mainstream influencers and merchants who have emerged in vertical sub-fields. They have improved their long-term business performance by continuously creating high-quality content that matches their brand image.
According to Gao Yaixian, the head of the operation of Kwai’s celebrity merchants, over the past year, 6.27 million creators have monetized their content through Kwai’s e-commerce, and their content creation volume has increased by 252%, and the total transaction amount has more than doubled.
"Behind these numbers, we can feel a thriving author ecosystem with a strong vitality.
"Gao Yaixian said.
The Communication Innovation and Future Media Experimental Platform of Beijing Normal University previously released the "Electronic Commerce Industry Content Ecosystem Health Index (ECHI) Report", which analyzes the importance of high-quality content from a data perspective in the current electronic commerce industry, and assesses the content ecosystem of 27 mainstream e-commerce platforms in China using the index.
According to the ranking of the e-commerce industry's content ecosystem health index in the above report, TikTok e-commerce, Kuaishou, Taobao, Pinduoduo, and JD.com ranked in the top five.
The report believes that the content ecology in the e-commerce industry is an integrated concept, which integrates e-commerce and content, but not all content can be integrated with e-commerce. Good PGC (professional content production) and UGC (user-generated content) are the best carriers for integration with e-commerce. The higher the value of the content platform, the richer the consumption and promotion scenarios, the higher the possibility of e-commerce insertion, the stronger the commercial value, and the higher the proportion of e-commerce content production and consumption in the public and private sectors will be integrated.
On the scene, Professor Yi Guoming, a professor at the School of Journalism and Communication of Beijing Normal University and the chairman of the China Media Economics and Management Special Committee, gave an analysis and interpretation of the report.
He said that in terms of content value, the e-commerce industry has transitioned from “consumer accessibility” to “consumer quality” and high-quality, professional, and differentiated content is the “hard currency” of the e-commerce industry.
At the same time, content has become the fundamental and driving force for the new stage of e-commerce development, and PGC content such as knowledge payment, professional knowledge, and KOL (key opinion leaders) has become a standard feature in e-commerce live broadcasts.
Looking to the future development of the e-commerce industry, Yu Guoming made two suggestions.
One is to promote the health and quality of the e-commerce content ecosystem from the perspective of improving its content structure, establishing positive content creation and management standards, and achieving a healthy and balanced system index of the e-commerce content ecosystem.
Another is from the external ecology perspective, which is to achieve the healthy development of the content e-commerce industry and the value synergy and co-creation of the external environment.
In the future, the e-commerce industry will need more support in terms of data and artificial intelligence to make predictions about future development; in addition, it should provide more standardized and healthy growth space for merchants, achieve value coordination among enterprises, users, products and services in the e-commerce industry, and jointly create a healthy content ecosystem.

Xinhua News Agency commentator: Promoting the modernization of the Chinese way is a systematic project - a commentary on the important speech delivered by General Secretary Xi Jinping at the opening ceremony of the seminar on studying and implementing the spirit of the 20th CPC National Congress - chinanews.com
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 11th: Promoting the modernization of China is a systematic project - four opinions on deeply understanding the important speech delivered by General Secretary Xi Jinping at the opening ceremony of the seminar on studying and implementing the spirit of the 20th CPC National Congress
Xinhua News Agency commentator
“Advancing modernization in the Chinese way is a systematic project that requires comprehensive consideration, systematic planning, and overall promotion, and requires the correct handling of a series of major issues such as top-level design and practical exploration, strategy and tactics, adherence to principles and innovation, efficiency and fairness, vitality and order, self-reliance and openness to the outside world.
“At the opening ceremony of the training course for new members of the Central Committee, alternate members and provincial and ministerial-level leading cadres on learning and implementing the thoughts of Xi Jinping on socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era and the spirit of the 20th CPC National Congress, Xi Jinping, the General Secretary, scientifically grasped the laws of modernization construction, and profoundly and systematically explained a series of major relationships that need to be handled in practice, providing us with a scientific methodology for vigorously promoting the modernization of China.
The promotion of Chinese modernization involves various fields such as economy, politics, culture, society, and ecological civilization, and affects the governance of the Party, the country, and the military, as well as domestic and foreign affairs and national defense. It is necessary to make systematic plans and be willing to innovate and reform, and continuously achieve overall progress.
Conducting top-level design requires a profound understanding of the trends of world development, an accurate grasp of the common aspirations of the people, and in-depth exploration of the laws of economic and social development, so that the planned and policies developed reflect the times, grasp the laws, and be creative, and are integrated, coherent, and coordinated.
The promotion of Chinese modernization is an exploratory undertaking, and there are many unknown areas that need to be explored boldly in practice, and the development of the cause must be driven by reform and innovation, and not by cutting corners or waiting for opportunities to come.
Strategic issues are fundamental issues for a political party and a country.
To promote the modernization of China, we must enhance the forward-looking nature of our strategies, scientifically anticipate the future and lead the future; we must enhance the overall nature of our strategies, focus on solving major problems that are crucial to the prosperity and development of the Party and the country; and we must enhance the stability of our strategies, and once a strategy is formed, we must stick to it and achieve it over the long term.
We must grasp the dialectical unity between strategy and tactics, combine the principled nature of strategy with the flexibility of tactics, be flexible and adaptable, make decisions on the spot, and seize the strategic initiative in adapting to local conditions, responding to changes, and taking advantage of opportunities.
The Chinese nation is a nation that upholds integrity and innovation.
It is necessary to handle the relationship between upholding the correctness and innovation, firmly adhering to the essence and source of Chinese modernization, and unwaveringly upholding the characteristics, essence, and fundamental principles of Chinese modernization, ensuring the correct direction of Chinese modernization; at the same time, innovation should be given a prominent position in the overall development of the country, and efforts should be made to meet the requirements of the times, solve major theoretical and practical problems, and actively adapt to and seek change, vigorously promoting reform and innovation, continuously creating new impetus and advantages for development, and fully unleashing the creative vitality of the whole society.
Efficiency is an important basis for fairness, and fairness is a powerful guarantee for efficiency.
As we promote modernization in the Chinese way, we must both create higher efficiency than capitalism and more effectively safeguard social fairness, so as to better achieve a balance between efficiency and fairness, and promote the two in a mutually reinforcing manner.
It is necessary to balance efficiency and fairness, and continuously achieve development for the people, development relying on the people, and development results shared by the people, so that the fruits of modernization can benefit all the people more fairly and equitably.
To promote modernization in the Chinese way, we need to handle the relationship between vitality and order, so that society is both full of vitality and orderly.
We must coordinate the development and security issues, implement the overall national security concept, build a national security system, strengthen our ability to safeguard national security, and resolutely safeguard the security of the state power, the system, ideology, and key areas.
It is necessary to consider security factors more in development, enhance national security through development, use the results of development to consolidate the foundation of national security, and create a safe environment conducive to economic and social development, so as to continuously stimulate development vitality and achieve a benign interaction between high-quality development and high-level security.
In promoting modernization in the Chinese way, we must both stick to our own path and broaden our horizons, adhere to openness to the outside world, and continuously expand the breadth and depth of Chinese modernization.
We must adhere to independence and self-reliance, place the development of the country and the nation at the center of our own strength, and firmly grasp the destiny of our country's development and progress in our own hands.
We must continuously expand high-level opening-up to the outside world, participate deeply in the global industrial division of labor and cooperation, make good use of both domestic and international resources, expand the development space of Chinese modernization, and share development opportunities and create a better future through mutually beneficial cooperation.
By following this path, we can achieve great things.
Under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, and guided by the scientific thoughts of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era put forward by Comrade Xi Jinping, we should grasp the laws, work hard and be proactive, and creatively handle a series of major issues, so as to make unremitting efforts in the new journey of building a socialist modernized country in an all-round way, and continuously open up new horizons in the modernization of China.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese website) Biden’s government will blacklist six Chinese entities suspected of involvement in the spy balloon program on Friday (February 10).
The U.S. Department of Commerce said that these five Chinese companies and one research institution have helped modernize the Chinese military, particularly in aerospace projects, including airships and aircraft.
Companies on the blacklist have a hard time exporting technology to the United States.
The list is called the "entity list" and companies on the list will not be able to purchase technology or goods from American suppliers unless they obtain special export licenses from the U.S. Department of Commerce.
The companies listed on the blacklist are: Beijing Nange Aerospace Science and Technology Co., Ltd., 48th Research Institute of China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, Longgang Lianjing Remote Sensing Technology Co., Ltd., Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd., Guangzhou Tianhai Xiaohang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd., and Shanxi Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd.
Prior to this, the White House said it was considering taking broader measures to "expose and address" China's larger-scale surveillance activities that threaten U.S. national security.
The balloon incident caused further tension between China and the United States, and US Secretary of State Blinken canceled his visit to China.
On February 4, the United States shot down the balloon. The Chinese government lodged a strong protest with the US embassy in China, criticizing the United States for seriously undermining and damaging the efforts and progress of both sides in stabilizing Sino-US relations.
Based on the evidence from the existing debris and information from the procurement platform of the Chinese military, the US government concluded that the manufacturer of the balloon "has a direct relationship with the Chinese army" and is an approved supplier of the Chinese military.
Miao Ning, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said at a press conference on Friday that China has explained the situation and clarified its position on the accidental entry of a Chinese unmanned aerial vehicle into US airspace due to force majeure.
According to the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, she added that the relevant resolutions of the US Congress are purely political manipulation and sensationalism.
China strongly objects to this and firmly opposes it.
"Today's action demonstrates the collective effort we have made to identify and stop China's use of spy balloons, which have violated the airspace of the United States and more than 40 other countries," said Matthew Axelrod, the assistant secretary for export enforcement at the U.S. Department of Commerce.
”
Reuters reported that an employee of Guangzhou Tianhai Hovercraft Aviation Technology Co., Ltd. said they were not aware of the sanctions and refused to comment further.
The Chinese Embassy in the United States and have not yet commented on this information.

(Deutsche Welle) Several days have passed since the earthquake hit parts of Turkey and Syria, and the hope of finding survivors is fading. However, the rescue of a family of five on Saturday has brought great relief to the rescue workers.
According to the Associated Press, in the hard-hit town of Nurday in Gaziantep province, this family of five was trapped under the rubble for more than five days before being successfully rescued.
Rescuers first pulled out the mother and daughter from the rubble, and then found the father, but he insisted on being rescued first for his son and another daughter.
When they were all rescued, the crowd erupted in cheers.
In the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaraş, a 16-year-old boy and a 70-year-old woman were also successfully rescued in harsh freezing weather conditions.
“What day is it today?”
"The boy trapped under the rubble for 129 hours asked the rescuers who brought him back to the ground.
A man from Kahramanmaraş holding the cat he just rescued
The miraculous success of the rescue operation brought a glimmer of hope to the otherwise hopeless search and rescue efforts, but at the same time, the number of fatalities continued to rise.
According to official statistics, the earthquake on Monday has caused more than 20,000 deaths in Turkey, and the death toll in neighboring Syria is estimated to be over 3,500.
Although experts say that people can survive for more than a week after being trapped in the rubble, the hope of finding more survivors is becoming increasingly dim.
Rescue workers are still using thermal imaging devices to search for signs of life beneath the rubble.
At the same time, the focus of the rescue efforts began to shift towards helping the survivors who were in urgent need of assistance.
UN officials: disaster in the region “unprecedented in a century”
Martin Griffiths, the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, said at a press conference held in Turkey that the earthquake was the "worst disaster in the region in a century".
He also praised Turkey's response to the disaster as "extraordinary".
He also told a Reuters reporter that he hoped to provide rescue services to areas controlled by the Syrian government and the opposition, but also said that the matter was "not yet clear."
The United Nations has pledged an additional $25 million in relief aid to the people affected by the earthquake in Syria.
Earlier this week, the United Nations announced a $25 million allocation for relief efforts in Turkey and Syria.

When the earthquake occurred, a fault between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate ruptured near Prince William Sound, near College Fjord.
In most areas, the earthquake lasted from 3 to 5 minutes.
The seafloor displacement triggered a huge tsunami, with a height of 67 meters.
Since it was a holiday, many schools and businesses were closed.
This major earthquake ultimately resulted in the deaths of 139 people.
Of these, 9 people died directly from the earthquake, while the other 130 died from the tsunami caused by the earthquake.

The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant suffered a leakage accident due to the impact of the earthquake and tsunami.
This incident was classified as the most serious level 7 on the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale (INES).
The Fukushima nuclear accident led to the detection of trace amounts of radioactive substances around the world, including iodine-131 and caesium-137 (half-life of 30 years).
A large number of radioactive isotopes were released into the Pacific as a result of the nuclear accident.
According to the United Nations, at least 870,000 people in disaster-stricken areas of Syria and Turkey are in urgent need of food.
In Syria alone, as many as 5.3 million people have lost their homes due to earthquakes.
The World Food Programme (WFP) has called for $77 million to provide food for the victims of the earthquake who have been displaced in Turkey and Syria.
At present, the temperature in the disaster area is as low as zero degrees, and many disaster victims have no place to live.
The Turkish government has distributed a large number of hot meals, tents and blankets, but these supplies are still difficult to deliver to many people in urgent need of help.
In Syria, which has been embroiled in a civil war for 12 years, the earthquake has made the plight of the people even worse.
Within four days of the earthquake, the World Food Programme had provided food relief to 115,000 people in Turkey and Syria.
The World Health Organization (WHO) sent 72 tons of medical supplies for trauma treatment and emergency surgery.

The Tourism Board organized a large Hong Kong inspection team of more than 100 people composed of representatives from the Hong Kong government tourism department, the tourism industry and the media to visit Macau. In addition to work meetings and industry talks, representatives from the Hong Kong travel agency industry and the media visited multiple tourist attractions, hotels and tourism-related facilities in Macau in batches over two days (10th and 11th). This was done to introduce the latest Macau tourism products to the Hong Kong market and promote cultural and tourism integration between the two regions, thereby expanding the “joint tourism” market between Hong Kong and Macau.
Visit in person to introduce new ways of traveling to Macau
The Hong Kong delegation of 100 people included leaders and managers from the tourism-related departments of the Hong Kong government, representatives from travel agencies and cross-border transport operators in Hong Kong and Macao, as well as around 30 journalists from travel magazines and newspapers, representatives from tourism social media, online media, and bloggers/influencers. They came to Macao to exchange and explore the latest tourism resources in Macao, and to introduce the new ways of tourism in Macao to Hong Kong residents and tourists visiting Hong Kong, using the advantage of Hong Kong's transportation hubs to expand the "joint tourism" market between Hong Kong and Macao.
Two days of intensive activities to seek business opportunities and increase publicity
The inspection team visited the World Heritage Site “Historic Centre of Macau”, experienced the Macau Grand Prix Museum, “Time Travel: A Journey Through Three Pavilions” - an immersive digital experience exhibition of the Largo do Senado, Ao Pé da Cultura, the old town of Taipa, as well as several large resort hotels and facilities, including the Grand Lisboa, The Karl Lagerfeld, the Venetian, the Sands, Artelli multi-dimensional art space, and teamLab’s supernatural space at the Venetian Macau.
The members of the delegation visited Macau tourism facilities and experienced the "tourism +" elements of Macau firsthand, sharing Macau tourism resources and travel experiences with Hong Kong residents, and integrating the promotion and sale of the latest Macau tourism products to Hong Kong residents.

Seizing the opportunity of the resumption of cross-border travel, the Tourism Board has launched a promotional campaign in the Hong Kong market and introduced various promotions, including discounts on transportation tickets between Hong Kong and Macau, and advertising on online and offline platforms with a new promotional video.
After inviting leaders of the Hong Kong tourism industry to Macau for an exchange visit and for Hong Kong influencers to experience Macau's "tourism+" last month, this time they organized representatives of the Hong Kong tourism industry and media to visit Macau again, to increase marketing efforts and attract Hong Kong tourists to stay and consume in Macau. The two industries also held talks to jointly expand the "joint tourism" market between Hong Kong and Macau, and promote tourism in both regions, including in mainland China and overseas, to promote the recovery of the tourism industry in both regions.

We must carry out the decisions and arrangements of the 20th CPC National Congress with a spirit of hard work and perseverance, solidly promote the modernization of the Chinese way, roll up our sleeves, work hard, and act as the “foreman” to turn the blueprint into reality step by step.
We must remember that comprehensive strict Party discipline is a never-ending journey, and the self-revolution of the Party is a never-ending journey. We must tighten and consolidate the political responsibility of comprehensive strict Party discipline, and take the political construction of the Party as the guiding principle to drive forward the new great project of Party building in the new era.
We must strengthen our abilities to promote high-quality development, serve the people, and prevent and resolve risks, and vigorously promote the spirit of investigation and research, and resolutely prevent and overcome formalism and bureaucratism.
Shi Taofei, Li Ganjie, Li Shuailei, Chen Wenqing, Liu Jinkun, Wang Xiaohong attended the graduation ceremony, and Chen Xi presided over the ceremony.
Google AI chat robot “gives wrong answers”; its parent company’s stock price evaporates by hundreds of billions of dollars.
(Combined report on the 11th)
Google's new artificial intelligence chatbot Bard suffered a setback when it "gave the wrong answer" in a promotional video, causing Alphabet, Google's parent company, to plunge 8.9% on Wednesday, falling below the $100 mark and wiping out $110 billion (about RM47.65 billion) in market value, closing at $94.57 on Friday.
The market is worried that Alphabet is falling behind its competitor Microsoft.
According to a report by Reuters, Google released an advertising short film about its AI chatbot Bard on social media earlier. In the film, someone asks Bard, “Can you tell me about the new discoveries of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) for my 9-year-old child?”
Bard mentioned in his response that the telescope had taken the first photo of an exoplanet.
However, according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States, the first photo of an exoplanet was taken by the Very Large Telescope of the European Southern Observatory in 2004.
Reuters even reported on the topic with the headline “Alphabet shares plunge after Bard’s incorrect answer”.
On the other hand, Google pointed out that Bard’s response “emphasizes the importance of rigorous testing processes” and will combine external feedback with its own internal testing to ensure that Bard’s response “meets high standards based on quality, safety, and authenticity”.
Singapore’s tourism industry is recovering strongly, with inbound tourists increasing 19 times compared to 2021
(Combined report on November 11) The Singapore Tourism Board recently announced that the number of international tourists visiting Singapore is expected to reach 12 million to 14 million in 2023, bringing about tourism revenue of about 18 billion to 21 billion New Zealand dollars; the number of tourists and tourism revenue will recover to about 67% to 75% of the pre-COVID-19 level in 2019; and there is a high probability of a full recovery of the tourism industry in 2024.
The Singapore tourism market will gradually restart and recover in 2022.
According to the latest statistics released by the Singapore Tourism Board, the number of inbound tourists increased 19 times from 330,600 in 2021 to 6.3 million in 2022, exceeding the earlier estimate of 4 to 6 million by the Tourism Board, and tourists have already recovered to 33% of the pre-pandemic level.
From January to September 2022, tourism revenue in Singapore totaled 8.96 billion New Zealand dollars. It is expected that tourism revenue in 2022 will reach 13.8 billion to 14.3 billion New Zealand dollars, an increase of 6 to 7 times compared to 1.89 billion New Zealand dollars in 2021, and has already recovered to about 50% to 52% of the pre-COVID-19 level in 2019.
The Singapore government has taken multiple measures to accelerate the recovery of the tourism industry.
In April 2022, the government announced a grant of nearly NZ$500 million to stimulate the recovery of the tourism industry.
The Tourism Board recently announced that it plans to allocate NZ$110 million from this budget over the next two years to launch more commercial and leisure activities to attract tourists to return.
In order to make health and wellness one of the highlights of Singapore's tourism, the Singapore Tourism Board launched an expression of interest campaign on November 23, 2022, to develop a health and wellness destination on the southern coast of Singapore.
Wang Lingli, executive director of sports and wellness tourism at the Singapore Tourism Board, said that in recent years, more and more tourists have placed their physical health at the top of their list of considerations.
Developing a health and wellness attraction in the waterfront district of Marina Bay, with its Gardens by the Bay and Marina Barrage, is expected to contribute to Singapore’s tourism and economy, encouraging visitors to spend more time in Singapore.
Chen Beijun, director of the Singapore Tourism Board, said that health and wellness will become an important component of Singapore's tourism products in the coming years.
The COVID-19 pandemic has increased public awareness and demand for physical and mental health.
For this reason, the Tourism Board has been promoting health and wellness programs to the local public and international tourists over the past two years.
In June 2022, the Singapore Tourism Board held the first Health and Wellness Festival, providing the public with more than 130 types of health activities and experiences.
Singapore will continue to provide new travel experiences for tourists.
In addition to the newly opened Singapore Children's Museum, the Avatar World in Sentosa Harbourfront, the new "Explore New Horizons" exhibition at the Art Science Museum, and the outdoor theater newly built in the Night Safari, the Tourism Board will support the development and upgrading of projects such as the Flying Fox Park in Wildlife World Singapore, making Singapore an attractive international travel destination.
According to the plan, Singapore will establish relevant industry standards for the sustainable development of the conference, exhibition and incentive travel industry by 2023, and focus on improving waste treatment and carbon emissions to further optimize the tourism environment.
The recovery of the tourism industry in Singapore has accelerated the recovery of the aviation industry.
According to the data, as of December 18, 2022, Changi Airport has seen a strong recovery in passenger traffic, with over 150,000 passengers served per day, about 1 million per week, which is about 75% of the pre-pandemic level. The number of airline employees on duty has also recovered to about 90% of the pre-pandemic level.
According to the data, from January to October 2022, Singapore received 23.6 million visitors, accounting for 42% of the pre-pandemic period, and had 170,000 take-off and landing flights, accounting for 53% of the pre-pandemic period.
The rapid recovery of the tourism industry has also driven the recovery of the accommodation, transportation, catering and shopping industries.
The Singapore government and tourism industry have high hopes for the Chinese market.
According to Khor Suk Dan, Assistant Director of the International Department of the Singapore Tourism Board, a survey conducted by a Chinese travel platform showed that Singapore’s safety index ranked among the top three in the world, which is one of the reasons why Singapore is so popular among Chinese tourists.
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, about 3.6 million Chinese people traveled to Singapore for vacation every year.
As China relaxes its border policies, it is expected that the number of Chinese tourists will recover to between a third and two-thirds of the 2019 level this year.
Koo Suk-dan pointed out that in the future, the Tourism Board will closely monitor the signals released by China regarding its policies on outbound travel in order to respond to changes in tourist demand.
In addition to strengthening partnerships with Chinese online travel platforms and travel agencies such as Ctrip, the Singapore Tourism Board will actively prepare to receive Chinese tourists in response to new trends in outbound travel from China.
Looking ahead to the tourism market in 2023, the Singapore Tourism Board is confident that the tourism industry will recover faster than expected, as long as there is no significant recession affecting public income and no new outbreak of a deadly pandemic on a large scale.
Kim Jong-un and his daughter interacted closely, while his wife was ignored
(Combined report on the 11th) North Korea held a military parade to celebrate the 75th anniversary of its founding on the evening of the 8th. Kim Jong-un’s daughter, Kim Ju-ae, not only attended the ceremony, but also stood on the podium with her father.
The North Korean official media released a video on the 9th showing Kim Jong-un hugging his father, exchanging affectionate glances and whispers several times, as she gently held her father’s face with her hands and even touched his chest. This father-daughter interaction was broadcasted nationwide.
However, the First Lady, Li Xiaoxu, had to stand aside.
According to reports by “Chosun News” and others, in the official photo of Kim Jong-un and his wife Ri Sol-ju with their daughter Kim Ju-ae at the banquet on the 7th, not only was Kim Ju-ae sitting in the center position between her parents, but the next evening at the military parade to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of the army, she also stood on the podium with Kim Jong-un.
The North Korean official media, "Korean Central Television", released footage of the parade afterwards, exposing more scenes of deep father-daughter love.
Kim Jong-un looked at his daughter several times from the podium, and their smiles never faded. They even whispered to each other in their ears. Kim Jong-un even put his hands on his father's cheeks, and smiled back at him.
Other official media images also show that the mistress, Kim Jong-un, kept touching her father's face while sitting on an indoor sofa; and she touched Kim Jong-un's chest while walking with her father holding hands.
The First Lady, Ri Sol Ju, had to walk behind or sit on the side, always a few steps away from her husband and daughter.
According to South Korean media, the "golden master" has been increasingly exposed in the past three months since he first appeared in public on November 18, 2017, after the test launch of the Mars-17 missile. This is the fifth time he has appeared in a formal setting.
The North Korean official media referred to Kim Jong-un as the beloved son, the distinguished son, etc., and broadcasted footage of Kim Jong-un repeatedly shouting his pledge to die defending his bloodline while overlooking the parade from the stands.
These signs have raised doubts among the public about whether Kim Jong-un has already been predetermined as the successor to the Kim regime. The Washington Post analyzed that "this is a signal from Kim Jong-un to put his teenage daughter in the position of his successor," but some also believe that such a judgment is premature and that there are still various possibilities in the case of Kim Jong-un having a son.
Changyang Q&A | How to view the unexpectedly high January non-farm employment data in the United States and its future trend - Economic Observation Network - a professional financial news website
Q: How does Reignwood Investment view the January US non-farm employment data, which greatly exceeded expectations, and the future trend?
A: On February 3, the US Department of Labor released the January 2023 non-farm employment data, with 51.7 thousand new non-farm jobs, significantly higher than the market expectation of 18.9 thousand; the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, the lowest in nearly 50 years; the hourly wage growth rate was 4.4% year-on-year and 0.3% month-on-month, slightly slowing down.
In terms of the overall data, there are many one-time and technical factors that distort the data, such as the return to work of striking teachers, the revision of survey statistics, and the update of seasonal factors. In the future, there may be some revisions (refer to the upward revision of non-farm payrolls from 50.4 thousand to 36.4 thousand in January 2022), and non-farm employment may not be as strong as the data shows.
In terms of structure, the impact of layoffs in high-tech enterprises is still significant, but the proportion is relatively low; the newly added employment in high-contact service industries such as leisure hotels and education and healthcare has rebounded significantly, and the data shows that the labor shortage in the service industry still exists.
In conjunction with the equally strong service PMI, the recovery of job vacancies and labor shortages, and strong consumer credit data, we judge that the US service industry has experienced rapid recovery after the extreme weather and holidays.
We believe that the supply and demand tension in the US employment market cannot be improved without a recession.
At present, the US labor market still has a supply gap of more than 5 million, and the labor participation rate is slow to rise, especially the labor participation rate of 25-54 year olds has already approached the pre-pandemic high point.
In addition, the strong consumption demand driven by excess savings and consumer credit of American residents will further delay the impact of contraction policies on the employment market.
The continued tightness of the U.S. employment market will be the backdrop for the U.S. economy in 2023.
Coupled with the fact that interest rates are nearing the end of their cycle and inflation expectations are fluctuating, we are not optimistic about the continued decline in wage growth.
Before this data release, the US stock, bond and foreign exchange markets were overly optimistic about the Fed's path of interest rate hikes.
As inflation data continued to improve, the Fed maintained a delicate balance between shortening the pace of interest rate hikes and managing inflation expectations in the market, but the market ignored the Fed's hawkish stance and expected not only an early end to interest rate hikes but also two rate cuts by the end of the year.
In the context of a tight labor market and the unclear impact of contractionary policies, we believe that the Fed's guidance on interest rate hikes at the end of the year is relatively reasonable, and the adjustment of extreme market expectations and the congestion in trading may cause some harm to the market.
Despite this, the stubbornness of wage growth is difficult to change in the current trend of rapid decline in inflation. With M2 data turning negative year-on-year and various leading indicators of CPI turning positive, US CPI data has been turning to a period of rapid decline since October. The stubbornness of wage growth will only cushion future inflation data, and current market expectations are difficult to refute. The market may enter a new round of competition after the next inflation data is released.
Shengsheng’s founder, Zheng Yonggang, passed away due to sudden heart disease. He led the transformation of China’s first clothing company - Economic Observer, a professional financial news website
On February 11, a WeChat public account certified by Suning Holdings Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Suning Holdings") issued an announcement stating that Suning Group's founder and chairman of the board of directors of Suning Holdings, Zheng Yongqiang, died on February 10, 2023 due to sudden heart disease, at the age of 65.
In the 1980s, Zheng Yonggang served as the director of a state-owned cotton spinning factory. After being transferred, in 1989, Zheng Yonggang became the director of Ningbo Yun港 Garment General Factory, the predecessor of Suning Holdings.
In December 2022, at the 20th China Enterprise Leaders Annual Meeting and the 22nd China Enterprise Future Stars Annual Meeting, Zheng Yonggang said that in the Chinese suit market in the 1990s, the market share of the Sanshangyun brand reached 37%.
Suning Holdings Group (600884.SH) went public in 1996 and became the first listed company in the Chinese clothing industry.
At a time when the clothing business was booming, Suning Group began to transform, because Zhang Yonggang realized that “once the market is opened up, Chinese brands will naturally form a tiered brand market, and it is unlikely that Suning Suit will continue to be the sole leader and become the national suit for the Chinese people”.
In 1999, Suning began to research corporate transformation. Zhang Yonggang recalled that year, “When we came to Shanghai, we asked ourselves what we should transform into, and we specially invited many experts and scholars to hold some Zhuge Liang meetings and Taoyuan seminars.
Finally, we set two major strategic directions.
The first direction is new energy and new materials, and the other is big health with a future.
After determining the strategic direction, Sunsine began to look for cooperation. At that time, the carbon research institute of Anshan Thermal Power Institute was doing the National 863 Project, and the research fund was insufficient, so Sunsine signed a cooperation agreement with the carbon research institute of Anshan Thermal Power Institute to jointly promote the industrialization of the National 863 Project “Intermediate Carbon Microspheres”, engage in the research and development, production and sales of negative materials, and promote the commercialization of negative materials in China.
In 2001, Shenshan achieved the mass production of intermediary graphite spheres, and began to replace imports from Japan, becoming the main supplier of intermediary graphite spheres in the country.
It is the first lithium-ion battery negative material production enterprise in China, and has achieved the domestic production of lithium-ion battery negative materials.
As the application of lithium batteries rapidly spread, SUNPLAST’s lithium battery business began to develop gradually. In 2007, the lithium material business was written into SUNPLAST’s main business, and the proportion of revenue from the clothing business decreased year by year until 2013, when SUNPLAST’s revenue from lithium material business surpassed that of clothing business.
In February 2021, Sunshine Group successfully acquired the LG Chem polarizer business and entered the LCD polarizer market, and established a polarizer company called Sunshine Optoelectronics. This field has a relatively high technological content, and Sunshine Group’s main competitors are global Fortune 500 companies such as Samsung in South Korea, Sumitomo Chemical in Japan, and JDI.
Zheng Yonggang has shared his experience in post-investment management. “Chinese private enterprises acquire some high-tech companies internationally, but the success rate is relatively low. Why do these acquisitions fail?
Everyone will consider, I spent so much money, I must send someone to manage it, this is a common behavior,” however, Zhang Yonggang is different, on the day when Sunshine Acquired Sunshine Lighting, Zhang Yonggang announced in front of everyone that Sunshine, as a major shareholder of Sunshine Lighting, decided to implement a dual-system management, except that Zhang Yonggang served as the chairman, no one from Sunshine Enterprise would be sent to Sunshine Lighting, and the existing distribution system, corporate culture, management system, etc. would remain unchanged.
ICC Xintong Information released the negative data for 2022, showing that the negative electrode output of Shanshan exceeded 200,000 tons in 2022, with a year-on-year increase of 100%, accounting for 16% of the market share, and the negative electrode material made of artificial graphite ranked first in terms of output.
In the polarizing film business, Yano Research shows that Sunkyong Electronics, a subsidiary of the company, had a global market share of 29% in 2022, and is expected to reach 32% in 2023, continuing to rank first in the world.
In the first three quarters of 2022, the revenue of Shanshan was 15.841 billion yuan, and the net profit was 2.313 billion yuan. On February 10, the stock price of Shanshan was 19.24 yuan/share, and the total market value was 43.6 billion yuan.
On February 9, Sunsun said on the interactive platform that by the end of 2022, the company's graphitization effective capacity will be about 100,000 tons, and the graphitization capacity of the Meishan project is still in the process of increasing.
Wanders shows that at present, Zheng Yonggang is still the chairman and actual controller of Shanshui.
Tianyancha shows that Zeng Yonggang holds a total shareholding percentage of 40.1% in Shanshui Cultures Holdings Limited.
The general manager of Sunsun is Li Zhixia, born in 1968, and has served as the chairman of Dongguan Sunsun Battery Materials Co., Ltd., Ningbo Sunsun New Materials Technology Co., Ltd., and Hunan Sunsun Energy Technology Co., Ltd., and as the deputy general manager of Ningbo Sunsun Co., Ltd.
Sunsun Holdings said on February 10 on the investor interaction platform that there is no relationship between senior management of the company and the actual controllers of the company.
“Fund E account” has arrived: the CSRC authorizes the development of the consolidation and inquiry of all funds held by investors - Economic Observer - a professional financial news website
Reporter Chen Miao, Economic Observer: The purchase channels of funds are complicated, making it difficult to collect account information?
Always forgetting the “petty cash”?
These problems of the Kims will soon be resolved.
On February 10, the CSRC announced that the "Fund E Account" app was available for download and public testing on various mobile app stores.
It was introduced that “Fund E Account” provides a “one-stop” query service for public fund accounts and share information for individual investors, aiming to solve the pain points of forgetting accounts and complicated queries for small and medium-sized investors.
According to Wind data, by the end of 2022, there were a total of 156 public fund management institutions in China, managing fund assets of about 26 trillion yuan; there were 167 institutions registered for public fund shares, and 411 institutions engaged in the sale of public funds.
The account systems of each registration agency are independent of each other, and there is no unified query channel in the industry.
According to industry insiders, at the end of 2021, there were more than 720 million fund investors in China, which means that half of the country’s population invested in fund products.
Previously, investors needed to inquire about their purchases through different sales institutions, but with the “fund E account”, they can inquire about all purchases made through all sales channels, making it easy to keep track of their holdings.
What is the “Fund E Account” app?
According to the relevant documents, the “Fund E Account” app is a mobile application developed and constructed by China Securities for the public fund industry, approved by the China Securities Regulatory Commission. It can provide investors with one-stop inquiry on the off-exchange holding of shares of all public fund products in the market.
Investors can conveniently and quickly obtain information about their off-exchange holdings of publicly offered fund products of all fund managers purchased through various sales channels through the “Fund E Account”, which can greatly improve the efficiency of inquiries.
Specifically, the information that investors can query through the "fund E account" includes information on fund accounts opened with all public fund managers, transaction accounts opened with public fund sales institutions, and off-exchange shareholdings of products such as publicly offered securities investment funds and asset management plans established by securities companies with no limit on the number of investors.
Liu Yicheng, the business manager of Shanghai Securities Fund Evaluation Research Center, told the reporter from Economic Observer that investors can use the "Fund E Account" app to learn about all their offshore publicly offered fund holdings at one stop, helping them to find their "forgotten assets", and more importantly, it helps customers to collect comprehensive information on their fund investments across all accounts, allowing them to better manage their investments, make more timely, accurate and complete decisions, and better optimize their fund portfolios and financial arrangements.
How do I register and use it?
The reporter noticed that the “Fund E account” app has been uploaded to the app stores of Huawei, Apple, Xiaomi, OPPO, and vivo, but the app is still in the public testing phase and registration requires an invitation code, which investors can obtain by contacting the fund management company that manages their fund.
A customer service staff member from a large public fund in Shanghai provided an 6-digit invitation code to the reporter of Economic Observer and told the reporter, “During the trial run of the APP, China Clearing provides a certain number of invitation codes to each fund manager, which investors can obtain by calling us, and we will provide them.
After the trial run is over, users will no longer need an invitation code to register.
”
The reporter registered an account and completed the query by downloading and using the relevant documents of the “Fund E account” disclosed on the official website of the China Securities Regulatory Commission. The whole process only took a few minutes and mainly consisted of four steps: user registration, real name authentication, bonding of fund accounts, and public fund query.
After the real name authentication, click the “Assets” fund binding button. All the fund products purchased by the reporter through various fund sales platforms will appear in the binding option list (bindable accounts). After binding, you can see the total assets of the funds you have invested in and start using the query function.
It is worth noting that the “Fund E account” only provides query services for investors and cannot be used for redemption and trading.
The data displayed in the “Fund E account” is generally the date three trading days before the date of the user’s query (T day).
For example, on February 10, when you open the "Fund E account", the total assets, fund shares, and net asset value displayed on the asset page are the corresponding values from three trading days before that date, i.e., February 7.

The United States, Japan, and the Philippines have reached a consensus on defense against the CCP
Asia - On February 9, Philippine President Bongbong Marcos visited Japan and met with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
The two sides reached a consensus on opposing the CCP's infringement on the South China Sea and East China Sea. The leaders of the Philippines and Japan issued a joint statement after the meeting, saying that they would conduct substantive defense exchanges through the signing of a trilateral defense agreement with the United States and oppose the CCP's hegemonic policies.
According to Japanese media, Kishida wants to use this meeting to help Japan and the Philippines establish policies to address the crisis in the Taiwan Strait.
Xiaomakos visited China in early January this year and signed a deal worth $20 billion.
However, after that, Sino-Philippine relations not only did not improve, but rather deteriorated.
Earlier this month, the Philippines signed an agreement with the United States to open more bases to the US military to ensure security in the South China Sea.
The newly added base is 300 kilometers away from Taiwan and is the closest location to China.
If a crisis occurs in Taiwan, the US military may launch an operation from its base in the Philippines.
According to Japanese media, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, and even the Philippines have now formed an axis with the United States to build an "anti-CCP arc" in the Western Pacific to promote regional cooperation.
When the Vice Chairman of the Kuomintang, Xia Litian, visited China, he conveyed the message from Song Tao that the Green Party is welcome to visit Taiwan under the 92 Consensus.
This time, the Vice Chairman of the Kuomintang of Taiwan, Shih Li-ming, met with the Director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the Chinese government, Song Tao, and with the member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China, Wang Huning.
Zhao Chunshan, a senior advisor of the Kuomintang official institution Guoguang Foundation, gave a positive evaluation of Song Tao’s remarks to Xi Lianyin in an interview with the Taiwan Central News Agency last night, saying that China welcomes Green Party members to visit the mainland as long as they recognize the “92 Consensus” and oppose Taiwan independence.
The KMT side evaluated it as a new thing.
Xia Liying met with Song Tao earlier in the day, and the news report for that day did not mention this statement.
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party in Taiwan has been clarifying its rejection of the "92 Consensus" for days.
According to Central News Agency today, the delegation led by Kuomintang Vice Chairman Shi Lijun visited China and met with CPC Central Political Bureau member Wang Huning, the new Director of the Taiwan Affairs Office, Song Tao, and Beijing Municipal Committee Secretary Yin Li during their stay in Beijing.
When Shi Lijian and Song Tao met, they discussed the political foundation of the national unification, which is the "92 Consensus" and anti-Taiwan independence. Zhao Chunshan, senior advisor of the Nationalist Party's National Government Fund, said in the meeting that the "92 Consensus" of the Nationalist Party is the original "92 Consensus".
Zhao Chunshan analyzed that this was different from the previous meetings he had participated in.
In recent video conferences with scholars on the mainland and this one, I have not heard any scholars talk about the use of force or the "anti-secession law"; instead, there has been a call for the resumption of exchanges and dialogue.
Zhao Chunshan pointed out that the situation between the two sides was tense and dangerous, and the mainland of China hoped to convey its intention to improve relations through the Kuomintang.
Because there is no mutual trust between the CCP and the DPP, the latter still wants to do a good job for the people of Taiwan, and the representatives do not want the cross-Strait relations to be ruined.
According to Zhao Chunshan, Wang Huning also gave instructions to Song Tao in person, saying “you must implement the demands made by them (Taiwanese farmers and fishermen)”, and if it is not possible to solve the problem comprehensively, it should be handled on a case-by-case basis.
The report did not mention whether the KMT members mentioned the daily harassment of Taiwan by Chinese military aircraft and warships during their visit to the mainland, or whether the reporters from Central News Agency asked such questions during their interviews.
The AFL-CIO is again mobilizing a large protest against the government's retirement reform plan.
On Saturday (February 11), French trade unions launched a nationwide mobilization against the government's draft pension reform, calling on people to take to the streets to express their opinions.
This is the fourth day of social protests against the draft reform of the government pension system.
The number of people who respond to the call for the rally may affect the next action plan of the labor groups.
This is the fourth time in a month that the eight major French trade unions have jointly launched a nationwide mobilization, and it is the first time that the protests have been scheduled for a Saturday.
As Saturday is a day off for most French people, they do not need to choose between participating in the protests or going on a strike, and the trade union groups therefore hope that today's gathering will attract more people to participate.
The unions of the public transportation system, subway, and public railway companies did not call for a strike today, and the public transportation system should operate normally, allowing citizens to travel to the rally venues. Meanwhile, people in areas where schools start winter vacation can travel normally.
The trade union groups hope that more than a million people will participate in the rally today, while the police expect a national turnout of between 600,000 and 800,000, with 90,000 to 120,000 people expected to gather in the Paris city center.
Since the beginning of the protests against the government's pension reform plan, although polls show that most French people do not support measures to delay the legal retirement age from the current 62 to 64, the number of people who actually take to the streets to participate in the protests has gradually decreased.
The first strike demonstration on January 31 brought together 1.27 million to 2.5 million people across the country.
The number of protesters on Tuesday (February 7) has dwindled to between 757,000 and 2 million people nationwide.
This pension reform plan is currently being discussed in the French National Assembly.
The opposition parties, especially those led by the radical left, submitted countless amendment proposals, which slowed down the review process.
The debates between the two sides have also become increasingly intense and acrimonious.
A member of the radical left-wing party France Insoumise recently posted a picture of himself stepping on a balloon with the image of the Minister of Labor on social media, which triggered protests from the ruling party.
The Speaker of the National Assembly finally announced a 15-day ban on the member's parliamentary activities as punishment for this behavior.
Although this reform plan has triggered the largest social movement in France in more than 20 years, so far the government has made only minor adjustments to the draft and has not made any major concessions.
The trade union has already prepared to launch another action on Thursday, March 16th, and it plans to organize a demonstration when the draft reform bill is sent to the Senate for discussion on March 7th.
China encourages raising the birth rate by donating sperm to universities, with high quality standards
The sperm bank in Yunnan Province, China, issued an announcement on the 9th, inviting those with a college degree or higher or currently enrolled in college to donate sperm, and those who donate 8 to 12 times will receive a subsidy of 4,500 yuan.
According to reports by Taiwanese media today, the message became a trending topic on Weibo on the same day, and prompted many provinces and cities, including Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hubei, Shandong, and Beijing, to follow suit.
According to a report by the Liberty Times, China encourages university students to donate sperm.
The donation criteria for universities in different regions are different. The donation criteria for donors in Beijing are the highest. In addition to academic qualifications, they also require donors to be taller than 1.70 meters, have good facial features, no obvious hair loss, and near-sightedness not exceeding 600 degrees.
According to the report, the sperm bank in Yunnan Province stated that donors could receive a full male reproductive health check-up worth 1,000 yuan, “especially the examination of semen and chromosomes, which most people have never done before and is of great significance in understanding their reproductive status”.
The conditions for sperm donors include a height of 165 cm or above, a college degree or above, no color blindness or weakness of color vision, and no genetic or infectious diseases.
According to the report, a poster of Shaanxi Provincial Sperm Bank reads "Donate sperm for money, it is honorable", calling on young people to donate sperm and encouraging netizens to forward the message "to spread love".
The price in Shaanxi is higher than that in Yunnan. Eligible individuals can receive RMB 300 in cash each time, and those who donate sperm a certain number of times can receive a subsidy of RMB 5,000.
Currently, the highest subsidy is known to be in Beijing, with a maximum subsidy of 5,150 yuan.
The last communist prime minister of East Germany has passed away.
The successors of the East German Communist Party reported in a statement that "last night Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95.
Therefore, our party has lost an important leader.
”
On November 13, 1989, four days after the Berlin Wall, which had separated East Berlin from West Berlin for 28 years, was opened, Modrow said he would help turn East Germany into a democratic country.
At that time, the leaders of the Communist Party were forced to step down due to protests by demonstrators throughout East Germany demanding democracy and freedom.
Gorbachev, after taking power in the Soviet Union, demanded changes in the Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe.
In March 1990, Modrow announced the first and only free election in the German Democratic Republic (GDR).
The election results led to him no longer serving as prime minister.
Although Modrow undertook reforms, opponents accused him of trying to delay the political changes and reunification that occurred in October 1990.
He has also been criticized for attempting to reform rather than abolish the secret police.
In 1993, Mordrow was convicted of election fraud in the May 1989 municipal election but did not serve time in prison.
Some have claimed that these accusations are politically motivated.
From 1990 to 1994, Modrow continued to serve in the German parliament, and from 1999 to 2004, he served as a member of the European Parliament.
Modero sees himself as a reformer and wants to change the Communist Party from within.
In 1999, he told Reuters that he did not want the old East Germany to return, but said that the achievements of East Germany should be recognized.
Modrow was born in 1928 in the then German town of Jasenitz (now Jasienica in Poland) and trained as a mechanic.
During World War II, he served as a sergeant in the youth fire brigade and, as the conflict drew to a close, became a member of the Nazi militia, the Volkssturm, which conscripted men aged 16 to 60 for the final struggle.
At the age of 17, Modrow was captured by the Soviet army and taken as a prisoner to the Soviet Union, where he took part in anti-fascist courses and became a committed communist.
In 1949, the year when East Germany was established, he returned to his home country and found a job as a mechanic. He continued to study social sciences and economics and earned a doctorate degree.
Modrow was a member of the Free German Youth movement, which almost all East German young people joined, and rose to become the chairman of the party in the Dresden region between 1973 and 1989, during the Socialist Unity Party's (SED) rule.
He also served in the parliament of East Germany for more than 30 years.
In 1990, Modrow became the de facto leader of East Germany and held the highest state office.
Iran marks revolution anniversary, hackers who support protests shocked by president's TV speech
Iran held an official gathering on Saturday to commemorate the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, but anti-government hackers briefly interrupted a televised speech by President Ebrahim Raisi.
The president's live televised speech was interrupted for about a minute on the internet, with the screen showing the logo of a group of anti-Iranian government hackers called "Edalat Ali" (Ali's Justice).
There was also a voice shouting "Death to the Islamic Republic."
According to a report by Reuters today, hackers interrupted the coverage of the national television station during the Iranian anniversary of the revolution.
As Iran's official commemoration of the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution took place, the hardline government in Lacey faced its boldest challenge yet from young protesters demanding their ouster, but Lacey still called on "young people who have been deceived" to repent so they can receive pardon from Iran's top leaders.
Protests across the country continue in Iran following the death of 22-year-old Amine Mahsa Amini in custody of the country's morality police in September.
The deadly crackdown by Iranian security forces on protests is one of the most significant challenges the Islamic Republic has faced since the 1979 revolution overthrew 2,500 years of monarchy.
As part of the anniversary of the revolutionary amnesty, Iranian authorities released on Friday the imprisoned dissident Farhad Meysami and Iranian-French scholar Fariba Adelkhah, who had been on hunger strike in protest.
Earlier, the top leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued an amnesty decree that includes some prisoners arrested during recent anti-government protests.
According to the human rights organization HRANA, as of Friday, 528 protesters had been killed, including 71 minors.
The report also said that 70 government security personnel were killed.
It is believed that up to 19,763 protesters were arrested.
Iranian leaders and state media have been calling for people to vote in Saturday's rally to show opposition to the protests and support for the government for weeks.
On the night of Friday, the anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, official media showed fireworks as part of government-sponsored celebrations, and people shouted "Allahu Akbar!"
(God is the greatest!)”’.
However, many people at the rally were also heard shouting, "Down with the dictator!"
" and the "death of the Islamic Republic" in videos posted on social media.
On Saturday, the government TV station broadcasted live footage of official rallies across the country.
In Tehran, as part of the official celebrations, domestically produced anti-ballistic missiles, drones, anti-submarine cruisers, and other military equipment were showcased.
President Lesin's speech was frequently interrupted by chants of "USA, go to hell" - a signature chant at rallies in the state.
The crowd also shouted "Death to Israel."
Reuters said that Adelkhah, who has been in prison since 2019, is one of seven French nationals detained in Iran, which is a factor in the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran in recent months.
She was sentenced to five years in prison in 2020 on charges of national security.
They later placed her under house arrest, but in January she returned to prison.
Adelkhah denied the allegations.
Meszaros was released a week ago after supporters warned he was at risk of death due to his hunger strike.
He was arrested in 2018 for protesting against the compulsory wearing of headscarves.
The French Foreign Ministry called for the restoration of Adelkhah's freedom on Friday, following her release, "including if she wishes, she should be allowed to return to France."

Did the balloon incident open the eyes of the United States?
Strengthen restrictions on technology exports to China
According to a report by the Wall Street Journal today, the United States is preparing to further tighten its export of technology to China following the balloon incident.
Current and former security officials say the balloon incident highlights the national security threat posed by China and will generate more political support for strengthening U.S. technology protections.
The United States claims that the balloon carried antennas and sensors for intelligence gathering and communication.
According to Martijn Rasser, a former senior official of the US Central Intelligence Agency and current employee of the Washington think tank New America Security Center.
"This is undoubtedly adding fuel to the fire and supporting the hard-line view on China."
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Thursday that "we will also consider taking broader action to expose and address the larger scope of China's surveillance activities, which pose a threat to our national security and that of our allies and partners."
"US officials said they had informed the governments of more than 30 countries about the balloon incident, and international coordination is crucial to counter the threat from China.
According to Emily Benso, a senior research fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in addition to the actions of the Biden administration, the newly established Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party in the US House of Representatives may also put pressure on the United States to take more severe measures to slow down China’s development.
She said that lawmakers would feel increasing pressure to take a harder stance, which could force the White House to adopt a more aggressive policy.
The Wall Street Journal states that many people who advocate for stricter export controls are also pushing for the scope of the controls to be expanded to include industries such as artificial intelligence.
The U.S. government has also been developing a foreign investment review plan to examine whether U.S. investments overseas pose potential national security threats from China.
Analysts say the White House may face calls to move more quickly to implement the plan.
Syria-Turkey earthquake relief efforts continue day and night
Since the strong earthquake in Turkey, rescue teams from dozens of countries have worked tirelessly day and night in the ruins of thousands of buildings destroyed by the earthquake to rescue survivors buried under rubble.
In the cold, they often call for quiet as they strain to hear any sign of life from the crumbling pile of concrete.
According to a report by Reuters today, two more women were rescued from the rubble of the earthquake after surviving for several days.
However, the death toll caused by the earthquake rose to 24,150.
The death toll in Turkey was 20,665, and in Syria it exceeded 3,500.
The 7.8-magnitude earthquake that occurred on Monday continued to be followed by several strong aftershocks in Turkey and Syria, making it the seventh deadliest natural disaster of this century, surpassing the earthquake and tsunami in Japan in 2011 and coming close to the 31,000 deaths caused by the earthquake in neighboring Iran in 2003.
A similar strong earthquake that occurred in northwestern Turkey in 1999 caused the deaths of more than 17,000 people.
The Turkish authorities said on Saturday that two women were trapped for 122 hours after the deadliest earthquake in the region in 20 years, and were rescued by rescuers from the rubble of collapsed buildings in Turkey.
The other injured man, 55-year-old Masallah Cicek, was rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building in Diyarbakir, the largest city in southeast Turkey.
In the cold, rescuers often call for quiet as they strain to hear any signs of life from the rubble.
In Samandag district of Turkey, rescuers crouched under concrete slabs, whispering "Inshallah" - "God willing" - as they carefully reached into the rubble to rescue a 10-day-old baby.
He opened his eyes and the baby, Yagiz Ulas, was wrapped in a blanket and taken to a field hospital.
The video footage shows that the emergency personnel also took away his mother, who was dizzy and pale on the stretcher but conscious.
Fuat Oktay, the Vice President of Turkey, told reporters at night that 67 people were rescued from the rubble within the past 24 hours, and a total of 31,000 rescue personnel were deployed in the affected areas.
He said that about 80,000 people were receiving treatment in hospitals, while 1.05 million people were homeless due to the earthquake and were crowded in temporary shelters.
As many people lack food in the cold winter conditions, the public's doubts about the response of the leaders of the two countries to the disaster are increasing.
According to Syrian official media, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his wife Asma visited a hospital in Aleppo, which is reportedly the first time he has visited the affected area since the earthquake.
Earlier, the World Food Programme said that its stocks in the northwest of Syria, which is controlled by the rebels, were running out due to the complicated rescue work caused by the war situation.
On Friday, Erdogan visited Adiyaman province in Turkey, where he admitted that the government's response had not been as fast as expected.
Opponents have seized on the issue to attack Erdogan, who is seeking re-election in a vote on May 14 that could be postponed because of the disaster.
Reuters said that anger over delayed aid and rescue efforts could affect the election.
Even before the earthquake, the vote was seen as the most serious challenge to Erdogan's 20-year rule.
Erdogan called for unity and condemned what he called "negative campaigning for political gain."
Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of Turkey's main opposition party, criticized the government's response.
Critics said, “The earthquake was big, but what is more serious is the lack of coordination, planning, and incompetence.

VNA Hanoi – According to a report by a special correspondent of VNA, on the morning of February 11, during his visit to Brunei Darussalam, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, Prime Minister of Vietnam, and his wife visited the University of Brunei Darussalam (UBD, also known as “Brunei University”).
The University of Brunei Darussalam is the largest center of higher education and scientific research in Brunei, and is ranked third in the university rankings in the region.
The University of Brunei Darussalam is one of the symbols of Vietnam-Brunei cooperation in education and training.
Brunei University officially established a cooperative relationship with Vietnam’s FPT University in July 2013, and the main area of cooperation is English language training.
In addition to English, French, German, Japanese and Korean as foreign languages, the University of Brunei Darussalam has also included Vietnamese in its curriculum.
When visiting the University of Brunei, the Prime Minister of Vietnam, Pham Minh Chinh, and his wife had an exchange with students in the Vietnamese language class.
Prime Minister Phan Minh Giang is happy that more and more foreigners are learning Vietnamese, and he is actively contributing to promoting the cultural characteristics and local customs of Vietnam to the world.
The Prime Minister of the Government, Phan Thanh Binh, expressed his belief and hope that the Vietnamese language teaching team of the University of Brunei Darussalam will become stronger; the students in the Vietnamese language class will become more interested in the language, work hard to learn it fluently, and become ambassadors of the friendly and cooperative relationship between the two countries.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh also took the opportunity to communicate with Vietnamese students studying English at the FPT-UBD Global Center in Tien Giang City via video, to learn about their learning situation, especially during the pandemic.
According to Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, the cooperative relationship between Vietnam’s FPT University and the University of Brunei Darussalam, especially the FPT-UBD Global Center, is a vivid symbol of the cooperative relationship between Vietnam and Brunei in education.
At the same time, I hope that the students of the center will make greater progress in their studies and make positive contributions to the friendly and cooperative relations between Vietnam and other countries.
Prime Minister Phan Minh Giang highly appreciated the achievements of the two countries in educational cooperation during his discussions with the Minister of Education of Brunei and leaders of Brunei University, including the cooperation between FPT University and Brunei University, and the initiative of Brunei University to include Vietnamese language in its teaching curriculum.
Prime Minister Prayut Wongsuwan hopes that the University of Brunei Darussalam will continue to pay attention to ensuring the quality of Vietnamese language teaching and further expand the size of the Vietnamese language program.
Pham Minh Chinh, the Prime Minister of Vietnam, also highly evaluated the positive results of cooperation between the two countries based on the Memorandum of Understanding on Educational Cooperation signed in April 2014; he suggested that Brunei continue to provide more scholarships and effectively carry out various short-term exchange training programs, such as the Global Discovery Programme and the Discovery Year.
Prime Minister Phan Minh Giang highly appreciated the establishment of the first branch of the University of Brunei Darussalam in Vietnam; he believed that the university would become increasingly strong in terms of its development in the region and the world; and he hoped to further expand cooperation with Vietnamese higher education institutions.
On this occasion, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha and his wife planted a commemorative tree in the campus of the University of Brunei Darussalam and left a message in the commemorative book.
Prime Minister Prayut Wongsuwan wished that the University of Brunei Darussalam would continue to develop and contribute more and more to the education sector of Brunei, and that it would develop deeper and broader cooperation with educational and training institutions in Vietnam.

VNA Hanoi – The Prime Minister of Vietnam, Phan Van Khai, and his wife have successfully completed their official visits to Singapore and Brunei, achieving comprehensive, practical and concrete results, VNA special envoy reported.
In the three days of his visit to Singapore and Brunei, Prime Minister Fan Mingcheng participated in more than 30 different activities.
The achievements made have injected new impetus into promoting the strategic partnership and comprehensive partnership between Vietnam and Laos in a deeper, broader and more effective direction.
During his visits to the two countries, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh continued to reiterate Vietnam’s foreign policy of independence, diversification, and change, and its willingness to be a good friend and reliable partner to all countries and a responsible member of the international community.
Strengthening relations with Singapore and Brunei is the need of each country, and the commitment to promoting the well-being of their people and to peace, stability and development in the region and the world.
At various meetings and conferences, Prime Minister Phan Van Mai agreed with the leaders of Singapore and Brunei to continuously strengthen political trust with Vietnam through the exchange of high-level delegations, the effective implementation of bilateral cooperation mechanisms, and the signing of important cooperation agreements.
Many cooperation documents were signed during this visit.
Among them, the Memorandum of Understanding on Green and Digital Economic Partnership with Singapore and the Action Plan for Strengthening Comprehensive Partnership with Brunei from 2023 to 2027 are the two highlights.

During the visits to the two countries, Prime Minister Phan Van Mai arranged time to visit and listen to the thoughts and wishes of the Vietnamese communities living there.
During the meeting between the leaders of the two countries, Prime Minister Phan Minh Giang suggested that the authorities of both countries pay more attention and ensure that the local Vietnamese community is treated fairly, so that they have the opportunity to contribute to local society and cultivate relations between the two countries.
Both leaders agreed to and supported this proposal.
In particular, Prime Minister Fan Mingjiang shared with the leaders of the two countries the desire for a united, peaceful, stable and prosperous ASEAN community; they agreed to maintain unity and collaboration with ASEAN countries and enhance the central role of ASEAN in a complex and changing regional and international context.
On the basis of the important achievements obtained, Prime Minister Phan Van Mai’s official visit to Singapore and Brunei made active contributions to the effective implementation of the foreign policy line of the 13th National Congress of Vietnam, which prioritizes strengthening relations with ASEAN neighboring countries, the implementation of the 12th conclusion of the Politburo of the Communist Party of Vietnam on Vietnamese overseas affairs in the new situation (12-KL/TW), and the mobilization of the national unity force.

What exactly was the “object” that was shot down over Alaska?
Confusing and full of speculation.
The US military used the most advanced stealth fighter jet F-22 again on Friday afternoon (February 10) to shoot down an unidentified object flying in the airspace of Alaska, USA.
The location where it was shot down is 10 miles from the coast of Alaska.
This is the second time in less than a week that the US military has shot down an aerial object.
Last Saturday, a Chinese spy balloon was shot down over the coast of South Carolina in the United States after drifting in the US airspace for several days.
The Pentagon said the second object, which entered U.S. airspace for the first time on Thursday night, was tracked by the U.S. military as it moved over northeast Alaska at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet), about the size of a small car, much smaller than the previous Chinese spy balloon.
The Pentagon also believes that there is currently no evidence that the object is maneuverable.
John Coyne, the strategic communications coordinator of the National Security Council at the White House, said on Friday that although the specific appearance of the object flying in the sky was unclear, it "posed a reasonable threat to the safety of civil aviation."
Kobe said that this object was different from the spy balloon found in the United States, as it did not have a "payload" hanging from it.
"We call it an 'object' because that's the best description we can give it at the moment," said Kobe.
President Biden listened to the advice of the Pentagon before ordering the strike on the object, and he made the decision "very carefully," Cobie added.
The official description of the object by the United States can be roughly summarized as follows: it is the size of a small car, has no control sticks, no suspension system, and flies at an altitude of about 10,000 meters.
However, this information still cannot answer basic questions, such as what the object is, which country it belongs to, and what mission it is carrying out.
Currently, many analyses and speculations online suggest that it may be another Chinese balloon.
It may be from China, just like the spy balloon that invaded US airspace and the Chinese balloon that floated over Latin America, and it may be performing some kind of task in different locations.
Some people also associate this "object" in Alaska with "unidentified flying objects" (UFOs).
A report by the American news weekly cited a tweet posted on Friday by Peter Meijer, a former U.S. Congressman, saying, "I really hope that this 'unidentified flying object' is a spy balloon and not a legitimate UFO."
"It's surprising to see a satire that mixes alien spacecraft with weather balloons, but it's not worth sparking an intergalactic conflict," Mejj said.
Mejia tweeted this shortly after Kobe confirmed that the object in Alaska had been shot down.
Newsweek said that it was not just Mejia who suspected the object was a UFO.
Tennessee Republican Representative Tim Burchett criticized the government's cover-up of information last month and demanded that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) release a report on "unidentified flying objects."
Amazon's customer service attitude is hard to believe.
I suspect that very few people have seen this, but I want to say a few words.
This shirt was originally a long-sleeved shirt with a drawstring hood when we bought it, but it ended up being a short-sleeved shirt for me.
After receiving the clothes, I immediately contacted Amazon customer service, and at that time, it was confirmed that the clothes were still in stock. I requested a refund, and the customer service representative said they would handle it, and then I immediately saw that the name of the product had been changed to short sleeves, and the link I had bought was taken down.
The customer service then informed me to either keep the goods and receive a certain amount of compensation, or return the goods.
Is this Amazon's handling method?
It’s really hard to believe. The fact that the wrong clothes were sent is not my problem. As a consumer, I want to receive the product I’m entitled to, and I didn’t make any exaggerated demands. Amazon changed the name and said it was out of stock.
This is my first long review, and I hope it's not my last.
Sleeves that are incomprehensible to people
It is indeed hard, but if you look closely, there are many small cracks on it, making it unclear whether it is genuine leather. Moreover, the sleeves of this coat are truly incomprehensible. The sleeves of a jacket are usually longer than the sleeves of a dress, but usually only by 1-2 cm. This coat is 5 cm longer, and the arms should naturally hang down at the position of the palm of the hand, but the sleeves of this coat cover the fingers.
It’s easy to buy clothes, and it’s easy to return them.
But when will the money be returned?
The clothes are well made, but because the size is too small, I had to return them. However, it has been more than a week since I returned the clothes, and I still haven’t received a refund?
And to have to contact the dishonest FedEx myself, this is the worst shopping experience since I started buying from Amazon!
However, the store was good and cooperated actively to speed up the delivery and refund. However, the work of this Fullpeak Express is really infuriating. It took about half a month to refund the money. This partner is just trying to drag Amazon’s feet. The work efficiency is poor and there is no sense of service!
More suitable for young people
It's a 99 seconds kill.
The workmanship, color, and feel of the underpants are all good, they are soft/thin enough, and don’t have a gasoline smell.
Unfortunately, the style is slim-fit and better suited for younger people.
3XL, flat waist circumference 2 feet 5 inches, maximum stretch 4 feet, 1.79/80 kilograms, the waist is a little tight.
It seems like there is no drawstring around my waist, and it is quite difficult to loosen it.
In addition, it is uncomfortable to wear something so tight.
It's good, but not very brightly colored.
The price just went up by more than 200 yuan, what’s going on?
The first time Amazon used the delivery service, the package was not delivered at home; later, they arranged for the delivery person to deliver the package twice, but the delivery person still did not deliver it. Finally, they directly refunded my money, and this dishonest delivery person has no integrity at all. I strongly recommend not to use this Tian Tian Lao Bao delivery service again.
This time, they also returned a hoodie I bought, and the price went up by more than 100 yuan.
Amazon should not sell its own products like this
Buy it during the special price period, it is not cheap, but the reviews are very good.
When I received the product, I was stunned to see that the surface was heavily damaged, with damage in many other places as well. It was either a substandard product or a used one, as shown in the picture below.
I applied for a refund and the manufacturer said it was due to transportation after seeing the pictures, isn’t that nonsense?
How could there be wear and tear inside the goods?
There are only two possibilities: either it is a substandard or old product, or I deliberately damaged the product and then returned it.
Objectively speaking, I have no evidence to prove that I did not damage the goods, but based on my shopping record on Amazon, I think such goods should not be included in Amazon’s own products. Customers choose Amazon’s own products because they trust them. Customer win, we win. The success of customers is the success of the manufacturer, and I hope we can all work together to improve this. Thank you.
I have been using this product for less than a year and two E2s have appeared. I don’t know how to handle this?
I purchased this product on July 30, 2015, but the right two sets of E2 lights turned red in March 2016, which should be due to problems with the transmitting module. This doesn’t seem to match the claim on the Amazon website that the transmitting module can work for 7 years. I can’t find any after-sales service on the Amazon website, so I don’t know what to do?
It's okay.
The first purchase was a bad one.
It doesn't feel new.
The labels on the box were torn off, and the labels on the body of the phone were also damaged.
And it always goes blank.
It was better after the change.
The switching is pretty fast, it gets a bit blurry at night and the field of view isn't very wide, but it's more than enough for everyday use.
The only downside is that there is no card, I bought it myself, and also the fact that I have bought a phone from Amazon before.
There is a sticker on the packaging to prevent it from being opened, but there wasn't one this time. When I bought the phone, there was a sticker that looked like it could be pasted on the warranty card, but it wasn't there this time.
I am confused because I don’t know if the price has gone down or not.
Waiting for the supplier to respond
The packaging had no label, so I called the supplier and said that the lack of label indicated that it was genuine. If you have any doubts, you can mail the product to Johnson & Johnson for verification using the scraps on the edges and corners. They also left their license plate number and phone number, and promised to send a text message to inform me that they had entered my information into Johnson & Johnson’s warranty card. But I still haven’t received any text message.
I received the oil in the morning and changed it in the afternoon.
Second purchase.
I am quite comfortable with Amazon's self-produced products.
The mechanic who changed the oil said the oil was clear and it was good oil.
It was the second time I purchased it.
So I am still very reassured.
The delivery was fast, the package was not fussy, and after using this oil, the engine noise was significantly reduced.
It is good value for money, and it is hard to find synthetic engine oil for less than 200.
Support Star Crown, support winning, and effectively protect your car.
Japan Amazon caused serious harm to the interests of buyers due to customer service issues (shipping a 8cm pill bug as an 8c pill bug) (8c = 14cm, 8cm = 2c).
They admitted their mistake, but kept shifting the blame, and always emphasized that the goods were third-party goods and could not be controlled by them.
Order number: 503-4265464-1830254.
I originally purchased the page in size options 7c, 8, and 9c, and thought it was a trap at the time. I called the Chinese customer service of JD.com and clearly stated that 8 was 8cm. However, when the goods arrived in China, I found that there was only 8cm. I think this was a deliberate trap set up to cheat Chinese people (according to Amazon’s after-sales service). Now, this option is no longer available on the page.
Chinese customer service: I’m sorry for causing you losses, we have two options for you:
1. You can return the item, and the buyer will bear all the shipping costs.
2. If you do not return the item, we will compensate you with 1,000 yen.
(I calculated that the shoes were over 4,000 yen, which is equivalent to 200 RMB, and since I didn’t choose option 1, I lost 200 yuan.
Choice 2: I have shoes, and I was compensated 2,000 yen in the end, and the final loss was 150 RMB. Customer service: We have recorded it, and we will handle it seriously. The next day, they sent me a letter saying that I do not accept the mediation of Chinese customer service, and that was it.
I said: when the purchase page had options like 7c, 8c, and 9c, which were misleading, the Chinese customer service representative told me that Japanese codes don’t have c in them, like 140, but did you check other bug pages?
There are cases where there are both American codes and Japanese codes mixed together.
Moreover, why did you put the 8cm size in between the 7c and 9c sizes, which is the smallest size, what’s the point of putting it there.
Chinese customer service: We provide Chinese services, but we don’t know if you want to ship it back to your country, so we won’t reimburse your shipping fees.
I don’t understand this logic anymore. I am Japanese, and I need Chinese customer service. Chinese living in Japan don’t need Chinese customer service. Tourists visiting Japan don’t have the time to make international calls, so the question is, who needs to call the Chinese customer service of Amazon Global Store? It’s people like me who shop on Amazon Japan.
Isn’t the Amazon Chinese customer service just convenient for those who do cross-border shopping?
I am not very satisfied with this purchase.
This is the second time I have purchased Bambix diapers from Amazon. I had bought a box of them for my baby when he was 2 months old. I chose the diapers made of European imported paper. The first time I bought them, I was quite satisfied. My baby used one diaper all night long, and it really can meet the need of 12 hours without changing diapers.
However, this time when I bought L brand diapers, there were two packages in one box, and when I opened them, I found that the paper was quite soft, which was noticeably different from the imported Pampers. After using them on my baby, I found that they were still okay, and there were no signs of leaks or rashes.
However, when the second pack of diapers was used, red rashes appeared on the inside of the baby's thighs immediately, and they have not faded away yet.
I suspect that the two packets in one box are of different quality.
I won’t be buying from them again!
Wish to pay attention to the transport protection of the package
This is the worst packaging and transportation I have ever seen for an online purchase. There are no protective measures at all, no cushioning foam, no package buffer material, nothing.
Just a deformed box.
Moreover, the plastic boxes inside were packaged in a cardboard box that was crushed and deformed.
I hope it is authentic and of good quality, and I won’t dare to buy anything from Amazon in the future.
I would rather pay a little more at home, but have some guarantees.
Moreover, the problem of packaging for consumer goods has been commented on since 2016, and it still looks the same now, 19 years later.
This shows that Amazon doesn’t care about service feedback at all, and is far behind domestic e-commerce giants such as JD and Tmall.
It was beautiful, but a bit disappointing.
I really like the color of the entire cup, which is orange-red. Although my family is a family of boys, I still think that orange-red and yellow look great together.
It's smaller than I imagined, but since it's meant to be taken out of the house, it's still acceptable.
I took it home last night and tried it out. After opening the bottle cap, the distance between the straw and the cap was too close. Because the straw is vertical, my son always has to hold the bump on the cap while drinking, and he thinks this part could be improved.
It seems that the straw cups of other brands are tilted for a reason, because when it comes to children’s products, safety and comfort really matter.
Lightweight and high capacity
I like that it is lightweight and has a large opening, but the two separate compartments seem a bit excessive to me, and I’m not sure what to put in them.
After I bought it, I found that there was another similar one from a different brand on Meituan for less than 200 yuan.
Fake goods are particularly bad.
I was fooled by Amazon selling fake goods.
The customer service said that since I used it, I can’t return it, and I don’t know if it’s fake.
It hurts because of trust, after all, it’s a face mask, so go to a physical store and buy one, it’s worth it.
Because it was a flash sale, I didn't read the comments, and I have already submitted the e-commerce platform to the State Administration for Market Regulation. Let's fight for our rights together.
Is it broken?
Fake goods?
In short, a tragedy.
The second patch was chosen because it had fine pores, but when I opened it, it had a strange smell. I thought it was normal because I had never used this product before. When I put it on my face, I couldn’t stand it anymore. It had a strong smell that cannot be described, and I coughed immediately after inhaling it. My eyes also hurt, and tears came out. I immediately took it off to wash my face.
I tried another copy of the same product, which doesn't have such a strong smell, and I'm currently using it.
It reminded me a bit of the smell of cheap hair dye in a salon.
It's hard to imagine that Amazon's own-brand skincare products will be avoided from now on.
Traitors.
At the time of purchase, the activity page said that when spending 99 yuan, a set of “Three-Body Problem” would be given as a gift. However, the product did not come with this gift. When I called customer service, they asked me to show them the screenshot of the activity at the time of purchase. The problem is that who saves webpage screenshots? You yourself did this activity, and you still need the customer to provide you with the screenshot. Buyers, please be careful and save evidence in the future.
Feeling afterwards
This is the first time I bought something from Amazon, and I have several feelings about it. First, when I used the product, I felt that it was painless and had no stimulating taste. Overall, it was pretty good. It fell off after about 8 minutes of use, but there was a small amount of sweat and dirt on it; if you don’t look closely, you won’t notice it. Overall, it’s pretty good, and I will continue to use it and see how it goes.
Anyway, I think this stuff is really good.
I placed an order on the 27th and received the goods on the 12th, which was a total of 15 days or half a month. The delivery person from Amazon was also very nice.
Thirdly, don’t believe in Amazon’s Black Friday. Order on Friday and the price will be cheaper by nearly 12 yuan after two days. That is, I bought it for more than 170 yuan (including shipping and other fees), and it feels like they raise the price when they have a promotion.
The customer service representative said that the price fluctuates, but after I paid attention for more than 10 days, the price was just like this, with not much fluctuation.
Affordable price, made in Japan, with Chinese labels, with granules, and absolutely refundable!
The ones with grains inside are refreshing and leave your teeth feeling smooth. It’s much better than some second-hand stuff. They say it’s imported, but many of the items don’t have Chinese labels, so I don’t know where they’re sourced from.
From now on, I will never buy second-hand goods again as long as Amazon has them.
Here’s a suggestion: sometimes the order confirmation doesn’t show up on the Amazon app. I hope you can improve the app, and it will get better and better!
Over the years, Excellent has gotten worse and worse, with no quality of service to speak of!
Garbage Excellent does not care about customer needs and delivers orders between 19:00 and 22:00.
Because there is an elderly person in the family who is unable to get out of bed after surgery, the delivery can only be made at night.
To my surprise, they came to my doorstep at 12 noon without any prior notice.
If the delivery time is up to your discretion, why bother to make up a time for customers to choose from?
If your logistics cannot guarantee service, then you should not become an e-commerce merchant!
A senior with three wounds on his body had to get out of bed to open the door to receive the delivery, and had to find some spare change to pay for it!
The order has a contact phone number!
No one even called to explain!
The so-called complaint customer service of Zhuzhou is a group of people from outside who pretend to help you and give you a so-called response to your complaint.
There will be no changes or compensation!
I had put up with similar delivery time issues before, but this time I couldn’t take it anymore, it was too much!
The new book I bought was delivered with the front and back covers reversed, so I guess the quality problem is that I just sent the book to the customer with my eyes closed?
No one will contact you even if you leave a negative comment.
Over the years, Excellent has gotten worse and worse, with no quality of service to speak of!
I will not spend another penny on Excellence.
The picture quality is simply unacceptable.
As a title of “Ancient Map Collection”, this book is really hard to accept in terms of the selection of pictures, layout, and printing, and some pictures are even pixelated, making them unrecognizable.
Even if this book is not a professional atlas, even if it is a small illustration, it should not be a disgrace to the vast ancient Chinese literature left by our ancestors in the catalog!
(And many of the images can be obtained from relevant industry resources in clear original format) - what is the difference between using such images and not using images at all?
I regret this kind of academic spirit.
I will not comment on the text, as everyone in the Fang family has their own opinions.
Overall rating: 2 stars.
When I was in Grade 2, I only read this book out of boredom. I thought I wouldn’t get addicted to this kind of book, because the web novels I read before were not very attractive to me.
And then... I fell into a hole.
According to the plot, the whole book is relatively light and pleasant. When Ye Zui was still in the game, even when the guilds were fighting against each other, it wasn’t heavy because they were often beaten by Ye Shen Dog.
As for the part about the competition, it expresses a bit of the bitterness of the changes of the times (perhaps because I am too sentimental).
Reading the entire book took up a lot of my time in high school, but I just couldn't stop.
The full-time depiction of characters and emotional lines is amazing, and some characters only appear occasionally but still leave a deep impression on people. Characters such as Ye Xiu, Huang Shuangtian, and Su Moqing have a large number of fans, while characters such as Jiang Bo, Chu Yunshu, and others who are not in the center of the story are also very popular. In a light novel about e-sports, it is hard to find a character that is extremely disliked, which is the success of full-time’s character depiction.
In terms of the romantic plot, there is no “three thousand beautiful women, all of whom are either beautiful or corrupt” problem that is often criticized in web novels. All the characters in the novel have one thing in common: they like the game Honor and most of them want a fair victory.
The subterfuge is small, but there is no grand conspiracy, and everyone seems so simple and adorable.
This may also be why there aren't any particularly unlikable characters in the full-time cast.
The full-time IP is a big part of this.
Leaving aside the cultural phenomenon of web literature, Full-time Job is a good book.
He really does provide some blood and guts, some inspiration.
In April of this year, I decided to devote myself entirely to animation.
I have wanted to buy this book for a long time, but I never had enough money to buy it all at once. Then, when I decided to buy it, I found that the TB version was full of counterfeit products. Recently, another version has been released, and I really like the cover, but I still plan to buy the old version first. So, I bought a set on Amazon.
Next, let me briefly introduce the goods.
● The fourth book is not shrink-wrapped, but it is new.
● The 17th book was sealed but was opened; the quality of the book feels strange and not hard.
· Like the 23rd and 17th volumes, but harder and much older.
● The publishers of a few books seem to be different, for example, the 23rd and 17th seem to be the same publisher, but different from the others.
Overall, I am satisfied; it is a large box with 24 books, which is very satisfying.
The little lion in despair
When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as Lost City, but there’s a lot of text!
I read it three times before I finally read the book to the little kids. It's about a little lion who knows how to shoot a gun and loves to eat juice and candy.
When I saw the scene where the lion ate the hunter, I felt a little uncomfortable; modern city people find it hard to accept such an arrangement where animals eat humans.
In the end, this little lion who succeeded in human society lost himself, he was no longer a complete lion or a complete human.
Finally, only the back of the little lion is visible, and it is not clear where he has gone.
It is possible that the image of the little lion will remain in the memory of the grown-up children for many years to come, and will be recalled by them one day, perhaps touching or inspiring them.
A collection of works with great value for money
1. I didn’t know about TASCHEN before, but I recently bought a lot of their books because they are so powerful, both in terms of their selection and production.
This work has been released in three versions, the largest of which is almost 50 cm long and 34 cm wide, just like the complete works of Leonardo da Vinci; the medium-sized version is about 36 cm long and 23 cm wide; and this version is the smallest, and comes with a book box.
I personally think it is acceptable. Firstly, the price is cheap and the 700-plus pages are divided into two volumes, making it easier to read; secondly, it is different from the complete works of Michelangelo, where the paintings are the main focus. In this edition of Da Vinci’s black and white manuscripts, the paintings account for the majority, making it the best value for money for readers with limited budgets and who are not art majors.
2. The explanations for the painting section are great, with analysis of composition, drafts, and historical background (such as the Last Supper), but I’m not sure if it’s a printing or book size issue, some parts of the shadows are too deep, making it hard to see the details, which is a bit regrettable.
Compared to Michelangelo’s manuscripts, the content of Da Vinci’s manuscripts is much more extensive.
The former is already a genius, and the latter is too broad and too great in achievements to be described as a genius.
If you only looked at the paintings, you could only experience half of Da Vinci. After watching the manuscript, I was completely speechless.
Garbage, whoever buys it will regret it!
I never give a bad review, this is really garbage, I wasted money on it, give me a reason!
1. Do not change the date, suddenly become January 1, and reset the time.
2. The poor quality straps are not made of silicone, and I had an allergic reaction to them on my wrist.
3. I can't get my phone to connect regularly.
4. The battery life is only five days.
5. Sleep detection is not displayed, and the time is 0.
6. Not waterproof.
7. Other.
Logistics is too slow.
It showed that it would be delivered on October 16th, but I only received it on October 21st, and it was a bad review!
The delivery is too bad, I thought it would be slow when I bought it on Amazon, but I didn’t expect it to be this slow!
Overall satisfied.
At first, I was worried about the packaging of the camera, but this time it was fine. There was an inflatable bag inside, and the camera was consistent with the three codes. I was also able to register it on the official website. The shutter speed was 0, and I could only wait for the time to test the rest.
The delivery speed is also quite fast. I’d like to complain about the delivery guy here. Valuable items were left in the lobby, and he left so quickly that I couldn’t inspect the package in front of him. This is really unacceptable.
The seller thought of the customer before shipping the goods:)
The merchants are quite responsible and they specifically called to ask about the screen size of the camera used, really thinking about the customers.
The delivery speed is also fast.
The diamond film is also quite suitable and useful to use.
Battery not fully charged.
The machine is indeed good, I was wondering why it can’t be fully charged the first time I charged it. The charging indicator light has been red the whole time.
Currently, there is no official feedback channel for Amazon, so feedback can only be given in product reviews.
1. On March 29, the book was purchased for 31 yuan through pre-ordering, and it was shown that it would be pushed to the device on March 31. At this time, the book could not be previewed on the Amazon website (because it had not been published yet);
On March 31, the book pushed to the device was blank, with only the words "Please look forward to it," and the electronic version of the book on Amazon was reduced to 18 yuan;
I have repeatedly tried to delete the blank book downloaded from the device and synchronize it again, but I am still unable to get the electronic version of "The Nature of Business" with actual content. However, I can preview the book on the Amazon website.
I have a few thoughts at the moment.
1. The price is not the most important issue. The key is how to replace the blank books on Kindle with books with actual content, rather than always being told to “please wait” when downloading.
2. You won’t be able to buy the pre-ordered book anymore, because if you skip the line, it will be very complicated to download a book with empty content;
3. I hope Amazon provides a normal channel for feedback on such issues. When there are doubts about the download or use of e-books, there should be a place to provide feedback (such as a ticket or online customer service, which can be learned from the Microsoft official store).
Not really recommended to read.
I read it a long time ago, and I just happened to see it and write some afterthoughts based on my memory.
This book is not so much a collection of short stories as it is a collection of fragments of life about love.
The tone of the book is extremely plain, like plain water; the choice of words and phrases is the epitome of simplicity; and the plot is as quiet and plain as a street in the afternoon of a summer day.
Each short story is a fragment of time from an ordinary life, with no beginning or end.
They were finally collected and published under the title "When We Talk About Love, What Are We Talking About".
I think this collection of short stories, and its title, is a kind of performance art. The author wants to express that love is not just the ups and downs on stage, not just the cliché of urban legends, not just a love that is as sticky as glue, and not just what is above should not be represented by what is above. Love is also the mundane life, the monotonous days, and the lack of direction in life, the escape from reality, and the uncertainty about the future.
When you read this book, you may remember the quarrelling couples around you, the boring marriages of people you know, and the unsatisfactory relationships.
This is precisely why I do not recommend reading it. From an aesthetic point of view, the writing and plot of the book are bland and unremarkable, unless you live a life of turmoil or are living in a candy castle. Otherwise, you will feel indifferent and bored while reading it.
In terms of depth of thought, the daily events do not stand out or expand one's thinking and vision (this is different from Marquez's Love in the Time of Cholera), and the brief segments do not explore any issues, such as what kind of mistakes led to the failure of love.
What are the reasons for the breakdown of the protagonist's marriage?
So I don't recommend reading this book, whether you read it or not doesn't really matter.
The author's ideas are expressed more through techniques and forms than through the story plot, which is also the reason why the reading experience of this book is not very good.
It is suitable for casual reading and cannot be read in detail.
The book is well-structured, but the content is not very comprehensive.
It explained what and why many sales theories are, but was weak in terms of how to do it, only pointing out the direction but not providing specific practices.
In addition, the book feels like it was put together.
The examples include both domestic and foreign figures; both well-known entrepreneurs or salespeople and people who are not well-known.
I don't know if it's a story compiled for the sake of example, and if some cases experienced by the authors would be more convincing.
The terms "customer" and "client" are used interchangeably.
The title still refers to customers, but in the main text it refers to customers.
The e-book also contained spelling errors, missing punctuation marks, and incorrect numbering.
In short, this book is a good choice for beginners to learn the theory, but it is not suitable for people who are already engaged in sales and want to improve their sales level.
A quick introduction to the guidebook on Internet finance
This book is very shallow and can be said to be just an introduction. It can help you quickly understand the overall picture of Internet finance, but if you want to understand it in depth, you still need to dig deeper on your own.
Moreover, the book was written earlier, and the content about the subsidy war between Alipay and WeChat to cultivate user habits has not been mentioned. Today, the market share of third-party payment may not be as small as mentioned in the book.
Nowadays, many people go out to eat with their mobile phones, and merchants have abandoned UnionPay because of the high bank transaction volume.
However, I am very grateful to the author for writing this introductory book. It is clear that the author has at least several years of financial observation experience and is very familiar with the history of financial development in both China and abroad, which is why the content is so easy to understand.
It’s easy to write something that sounds grand, but the challenge is to write something that is easy to understand.
I appreciate you, and I want you to know it!
The first factor that determines a person's job satisfaction is not the level of salary, but whether they are given enough attention and appreciation in their work.
According to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs theory, after the basic survival needs of human beings are met, the most urgent need is the psychological need for understanding, affirmation, and recognition.
Indeed, for Chinese people, most of them “love you in their hearts but find it hard to express it”, even if they have love, gratitude and appreciation.
The author discusses five languages of appreciation in the book: words of affirmation, acts of service, quality time, tangible gestures, and physical touch.
I think what’s important is not what the five languages of appreciation are, but that you can use them from the bottom of your heart to appreciate and be grateful to the people around you, whether they are family, friends or colleagues.
In fact, the people who are closest to us need our appreciation and gratitude the most, and this is what will make our lives more beautiful.
By learning to appreciate, enterprises can to some extent retain talent and reduce the turnover rate.
Thank you to the translators for bringing us the wonderful thoughts and worlds from abroad.
Due to differences in cultural backgrounds between East and West, there may be some differences in language, and if given the opportunity, readers may gain more by reading the original version.
Thank you again to the authors, translators, and editors for their hard work!
It is suspected to be a counterfeit product, and Amazon should conduct a strict review.
The quality is terrible, the packaging is flimsy, it has no weight, and is even worse than the products sold at roadside stalls; it has no weight and no barcode, and the packaging of 10 bags is flimsy; it is not a qualified product at all; this is the worst shopping experience on Amazon, and I have applied for a refund; it is a quality problem; I recommend that the seller wake up and refuse to sell poor-quality products; additionally, I bought a pack of heart-shaped stamps, priced at 23 yuan/10 sheets at the supermarket, and I took some pictures to further verify the poor quality of the product; in order to provide consumers with a clearer reference and avoid economic losses and further dissatisfaction, I am sharing these pictures here!
Once again, we hope that Amazon can be meticulous and strict with the source of its products.
The hastily produced products fall short of expectations.
Advantages:
1. Big brands, cheap prices.
Advantage 2: The motor and blade are both guaranteed by PANASONIC, and they are OK to use, but they fall short of my expectations.
Disadvantages:
1. There is no charging indicator light, which is the most basic thing. You have saved on the power indicator light. I guess customers who buy a product for 300 yuan are a waste of time for Panasonic; they have no respect for them.
2. Strong odor. Even when charging for just 10 minutes, a strong odor of burning plastic can be detected.
The office was tested for one day, and the whole room smelled of plastic.
Compared to the Philips PHILIPS I have used before at the same price point, although it has more blades, the Samsung product is really not up to par in terms of quality.
Small packaging
When I received the package, I saw that it was the e-commerce version. It was smaller than the one I bought at the supermarket. It should be size M. The packaging was different from the one in the product description. This must be the new version.
The three stars are blaming themselves for not having seen the specifications of the product clearly. You sold me the wrong size for the e-commerce version, and what do you mean by “not up to standard”?
E-commerce is too complicated, so I still go to the supermarket.
It's just sauce.
I don't like the taste.
The kid doesn’t like the taste of toothpaste and always says it’s spicy. Maybe there’s a more appropriate word to describe it, but for now, that’s the only word in the kid’s vocabulary.
I bought it when I organized the event, and it was very cheap, so I feel bad giving it a bad review; I’ll give it four stars, but I won’t be buying it again.
It’s genuine and well packaged.
The packaging is complete, and an inflatable bag is included. There are no online reviews, and the product only appears in a single photo.
The plastic film on the outside of the bottle is just like the one described in the picture, and the delivery was very fast, arriving the next day.
It is genuine, but it is out of stock and I don’t know when it will be restocked.
A terrible shopping experience.
I placed an order on Black Friday, but the package was never delivered even though it was already signed for. When I checked, I found out that the package had been signed for a long time ago. None of my colleagues helped me sign for it. I immediately contacted the delivery company, but they said I had to contact the sender to initiate an inquiry. I contacted Amazon customer service, and had to wait for more than ten days. Finally, I found out that the package was delivered to the wrong person, and it took several rounds of communication before I finally got the package back. The outer package was already opened, but the product was still intact. I don’t know if it had been used before. In short, it was a terrible experience.
Wrong photo caption
I thought I would receive earphones like the ones in Picture 1, but I received ones like the ones in Picture 2. It’s okay that the pictures don’t match, but what does it mean that the left and right earphones have different volumes?
Although the names are the same, we still hope that everyone can pay attention and ask the responsible person at Amazon to replace the correct image in a timely manner. Thank you very much.
The operating system is generally good.
It took a while, but overall the picture quality is still good, and I didn’t notice any difference. However, this system is confusing and the boot time is noticeably slow. It’s also difficult to make good settings, and the software that comes with it is not worth mentioning. The response speed is just average, and it’s not even in the same league as my colleague’s.
The comments say that the design is very human-friendly, but I couldn’t find any human-friendly design; the position of the remote control’s common up, down, left, and right buttons and the return button is really not to be praised.
So, you can use it as a TV, plus a TV box and so on.
The price cut is too severe.
The price drop is too drastic, from over 100 to just 99!
Amazon had a lot of unrated orders, so I used a copied comment as the review content.
If I use this sentence to evaluate it, it means that this product is at least 85 points or above.
But for poor products, I would never be lazy to copy and paste the reviews, so that other consumers can use them as reference when making purchases, and the merchants can improve the quality of their products as a result.
Cheap and good wires, that’s enough for me!
This cheap cable should meet the HDMI certification standards. Compared with the crap products sold in China’s Akihabara (which are twice as expensive), this cable is sturdy and soft, and has no noise during 7-meter transmission. From now on, I will only buy Besee cables!
The products are fine, but Amazon’s after-sales service is really much worse than other websites.
After placing the order, I found out that I made a mistake, but I couldn’t cancel the order. The webpage for contacting online customer service always shows an error link, and I couldn’t contact them.
After the delivery person called me, I said I didn’t want it anymore and tried to cancel the order, but it didn’t work. The delivery person took it back and said I had to sign for it first and then apply for a refund.
When I applied for a refund, I was informed that food items cannot be returned once they are signed for, and I couldn’t call Amazon customer service because they said the same thing: food items cannot be returned once they are signed for.
I have bought non-refundable items before on JD and Sunning, including milk and diapers, and contacted customer service to get a refund, and not only did JD refund me for the diapers, but the customer service representative even refunded me for the smell of the diapers when I opened them. But that’s not the case with Amazon.
The rules are dead, people are alive. How should we contact your customer service?
Tell me whether I should pick it up myself or have the delivery person buy it for me; it’s not easy for the delivery person to do this, so why should I make them spend money to buy something that I didn’t purchase myself?
Okay, I won’t leave either. I’ll pay for it myself, but I have to give your service a 1.
I advise you not to waste your money.
First, I was full of expectations and thought that the products of the Dali brand should be good, but after receiving them, I found that the packaging was still good, the size was not bad, but almost all of them were soft; it was hard to tell from the outside, but you could feel it with your hands; when I put them in my mouth, there was no taste at all, it was tasteless and bland; when I bit into them, the flesh was yellowish, which meant they were bad; it was a buy-one-get-one-free deal; only about one-third of them were good, and I strongly advise you not to buy them; they are not cheap, but the quality is too bad!
After this experience, I will never buy fruit from an e-commerce platform again!
Where is the anti-counterfeiting mark on the product?
The corner of the bottle is deeply indented, which suggests it has experienced a strong impact. Judging from the outer packaging, the degree of damage is heart-wrenching. After all, the packaging is too simple for a food product, and it is also from an international purchase. There are no obvious anti-counterfeiting marks, and it is very easy to open the bottle. The most surprising thing is that the honey inside the bottle directly comes out from the opening, with almost no adhesive properties. Is this the case with foreign products?
As someone born in China, I am a bit confused.
It must be the real thing, right?
There is also a message saying it will be delivered on the 21st, but I received it on the 14th. This is my first time shopping overseas here, and I just want to write down my doubts. Maybe this is all normal?
The delivery service needs improvement.
I bought a total of 5 vouchers, and when I made the first reservation to pick them up, only 2 were sent, after much communication it was confirmed that 3 were lost and would be resent; for the second reservation, it was a holiday and neither the website nor WeChat indicated that reservations needed to be made on a weekday, causing unnecessary panic, and I suggest that this be improved in the future.
Great shopping.
The food is good!
I still trust Amazon’s self-produced products more, and now it’s very convenient to shop overseas. The delivery time from abroad is only a few days longer than that of domestic delivery, and I have to say that Amazon’s ability to clear customs for overseas purchases is very strong. It’s much faster than going through transit, so now I buy many things from overseas.
I hope the quality and price of domestic goods can be better. Many things are made in China, but they are cheaper if you buy them from other countries. I hope this can be improved.
Garbage.
When you see a package like this, do you think it looks like garbage on the side of the road?
A packaging made of easily breakable plastic comes from so-called Germany in a plastic bag, is this kind of packaging responsible?
I think such packaging is like packaging for garbage. The product is packaged in a very simple way without any measures to prevent damage. It is packaged in a simple plastic bag. After I received it, the package was completely deformed, and the items inside were also damaged.
If I had just encountered one like this, I would have bought a few of them, but I contacted Amazon customer service, and they said I could return them, but I would have to pay for the shipping, and the shipping fee would be returned to me in the form of a gift card.
I asked if I could pay the shipping fee with cash and receive a gift card in return, which would be straightforward if I just bought your gift card. I also had to ship the product to a warehouse in Germany, which is like buying a product and being punished for it!
I kept telling the customer service that it was their responsibility for the problem, but they didn’t even admit it was their responsibility. They didn’t dare to take responsibility even a little bit. What kind of after-sales service is this? One word: shameful! But I guess Amazon won’t give me the chance to publish this review, and they will directly delete it!
Quality is good, 5 stars, but logistics is bad
1. The quality is good, it’s a bargain, the price is reasonable, and it’s worth the money.
2. It is solid, has sufficient material, the welding points are firm, the surface treatment is good, and the color is beautiful.
3. Logistics is a problem, the order placed on the 3rd arrived on the 11th.
If Amazon had not marked the estimated delivery date as February 7, I might have been satisfied.
5. However, if the expected delivery time is marked, it is equivalent to a promise to the user, and it is difficult for the user to accept when the promise cannot be fulfilled.
6. If you are not sure you can keep your promise, don’t make it.
7, in fact, I care a lot about the commitments made by merchants.
8. That's why I got a low score.
The gold wire will turn black.
The effect is there, but whether it is noticeable or not depends on the individual, or the psychological effect.
One thing that’s not so good is the gold wire. Originally, it looked good in the design, but in reality, the gold wire will lose its color and you will find some gold powder on your hands and the car if you handle it a few times.
I hope the product can be improved.
This square one doesn't have any decorative effect, so there's no need to put gold wire on it; it will just get dirty on the car when it falls off.
The items are in good condition, the speed is good, and they are packaged in two different packages.
The delivery speed is quite fast, but it took 2 packages in 8 days, and the packaging was different; one was obviously more shock-resistant with thick cardboard and plastic wrap, and the outer packaging was easy to open; it looked like a domestic delivery box, with a few airbags to make up for it; it felt a bit sloppy.
Yarran mattresses are really good.
The mattress of 34CM is not that thick, you can sleep on the bed without the mattress.
The quality is good, both the front and back are soft, and sleeping on it is very comfortable, I fell asleep very quickly.
After receiving the mattress, I found that there were some stains on it due to violent transportation by the courier. Yarran’s customer service was responsible and efficient in resolving the problem.
Not self-produced goods, Amazon is shameless.
The page clearly indicates self-sale, but in fact it is delivered by the supplier and after-sales service is provided by the supplier, and if there is a problem, you should contact the supplier yourself.
If you want to cancel the order, sorry, the order information has been transmitted to the supplier and cannot be canceled; if you want to return or exchange the product, you have successfully applied for a return or exchange on Amazon, but sorry, no one can help you, and you need to contact the supplier yourself to return the product.
This is a self-produced product of Nima.
The product is not delivered by Amazon, and Amazon will not take responsibility for after-sales service. The customer service even said “I will contact the supplier for you”, and claimed that it is self-owned, which is too shameless. It is a blatant disrespect and fraud against consumers!
The experience of being sad
The filter cartridges I bought from other websites worked well, and even after 28 days, there was no lime scale after another couple of days.
I always buy good quality products on Amazon, so this time I thought I’d try buying them here. This was the first time I bought a filter on Amazon, and I was disappointed. Not only did it start to develop limescale early on, but the filter also had small black carbon powder floating in it as early as day 28. I didn’t know whether to continue using it or just throw it away, it was so frustrating.
It's not as good as you might imagine.
Compared to the plugboards I have used before, the external workmanship is average, and I hope that the internal workmanship is as described by the store, but whether each independent unit is powered is lacking in display until it is opened.
The packaging was damaged, so I had to wait to test the quality of the product.
The outer packaging is severely damaged, but the packaging box inside seems to be new. However, the manual does not seem to be new. The renovation was completed in September, and the products were stored. I hope they are not bad. Please explain to me why several customers have mentioned that the packaging is damaged, but you are still able to sell them. Thank you!
Overall good, with a few minor issues.
When I bought a water filter for the first time, after reading several reviews, I chose LAICA because I thought it was relatively cost-effective. After receiving the product and following the instructions to install the filter, I tried it out and found that the filtered water and the original water seemed to mix at the spout (the water tank seal was not very tight). Overall, I think it’s not bad.
When using it, make sure to wait until all the water is filtered out before pouring it out!
Image is incomplete.
The picture did not capture the details of the side, and the details of the side did not match the style of the main body, with a big difference; this is one issue; this bead is made in Thailand, but there is no indication of the place of origin; there is no indication of the material; when I bought it in the UK, each item came with its own box, but here there is only a simple plastic bag, and there is no product mark on the bead, so I have no way of knowing if it is genuine or fake.
Be careful when you buy things, especially those from Hong Kong.
Amazon customer service is terrible.
I placed an order two days ago and found that the price had dropped by 40 yuan today. I spent a long time trying to find customer service, and the customer service said that they couldn’t refund the difference and that I could place a new order and return the product.
This kind of customer experience and service is really different from that of Taobao.
Not bad, it's worth trying for beginners.
It looks good and is not inferior to the top-grade diamond. I’ve seen the price at the mall before, it’s several hundred yuan at least. This is the first time I’ve played with a diamond, and it’s okay.
It's good.
The items are really good. For my girlfriend, it was a bit unpleasant when the courier didn’t deliver the package during lunchtime. The courier company directly stored the package in the locker and didn’t send me a confirmation message to pick it up. I had to go twice.
However, the baby is really good.
Worth buying.
The little monkey is cute, and Amazon’s discounts are really generous. I ordered it from the Zhiyoujiang official website and it was delivered today afternoon, which is really fast.
The postal and delivery workers are also responsible.
Bravo!
A customer's confession
1. When you receive such substandard products, Amazon customer service tells you not to worry, we will contact you within 54 hours.
2 Then you contact the customer service staff, and they will tell you that this issue will be handled by a specialist, who will inform you of the outcome.
You can never reach this commissioner on your own, you don't know her extension number, and there is no direct dial phone number, so you can't reach her, only she can reach you.
Tragically, after waiting nearly three days, the commissioner contacted me and my phone was off, so I didn't receive the commissioner's call.
I waited for two hours for the specialist’s call, during which I proactively contacted Amazon customer service and emailed them to ask them to call me back.
It has been nearly three days, and I still don’t know what Amazon will do about this defective coffee maker I received!
The products on Amazon in the US are fine, and this kind of shopping method is good for overseas purchases, but the service provided by Meiya is far inferior.
For me, I can only continue to wait...
The bottom is uneven.
Because the review said it was good, and everyone was looking forward to this pot, and when I got it, I really liked it, it was lightweight, but when I used it, I found a problem – the bottom of the pot was not flat, it was raised in the middle and sunken around the edges, the oil ran to the edges, and the special big fatty pork I bought just couldn’t be fried because there was no oil to cover the central area, I was disappointed, I couldn’t even use the pot, and I guess this kind of structure can’t be used to cook normally.
I don’t know if it was just bad luck, but I just got a pot with a crooked bottom, and fortunately Amazon provides a one-month return policy, so I decided to return it.
I cleaned the pot thoroughly and wasted half a day doing so.
Good product design requires matching manufacturing processes to achieve it.
This is a product with a very simple design style.
The shape of the cube is designed with a slight arch on the top.
It should have been a very fluid line.
Unfortunately, the final result was not achieved.
Because there are two parts at the top, the front is the control panel and the back is the water tank cover.
The curvature of the top cover and the control panel were not consistent, resulting in a height difference of up to 2 mm after assembly.
Although it looks like a very small gap.
But it can be said to have destroyed the entire design.
I feel a bit sorry for the product designer.
It seems that Midea’s product managers are not capable of creating products of this caliber.
(Of course, I can’t expect too much from the after-sales lady, but when I heard her say that all the individual products are like this, and it’s not just my one that has a problem, her incredulity and reluctance to accept the truth made me realize that I can’t expect too much from beauty products either) 2019-7-7 The pump has malfunctioned and the water flow is low. It has been repaired for the second time, and it broke again two weeks after the first repair.
It’s a good deal after the discount, but it’s sad to see fake discounts on Amazon
It is highly insulated and can be purchased one week after the baby is born.
You can’t feel any heat from the outside of the pot, which means it won’t burn you and effectively prevents heat from escaping.
The air conditioning in the room can still maintain a high temperature after a whole night.
Amazon said that the anniversary event had 320 great deals, but later I found that everyone had them for 249, 289, and 299 yuan. I felt cheated for a moment, but after comparing prices at the supermarket, I found that the deals from Amazon were still much cheaper than those from other brands. From now on, I can bring them with me when I go out.
Vitamix 6300
I had been waiting for a long time, and when I saw that Meituan 6300 was on sale and that Caiyao Overseas Purchase was the same price, I quickly placed my order.
I placed an order on September 2 and it was expected to arrive on September 21. However, it arrived on September 12, which is about 10 days earlier, so it was really fast!
The packaging is small, and it comes directly from the original Vitamix packaging, and Amazon is not afraid that it will be damaged during shipping across the ocean!
The machine looks new and comes with all the accessories. The only problem is that the cup shakes a lot when placed on the base, and I’m afraid it will fly out when I turn it on!
I asked a friend who has 5200, and it seems to be less tight than mine.
The recipes that come with it are in English, which is quite tiring to read, and I couldn’t find a Chinese version online, what a hassle!
I quickly bought an inverter after receiving the package, and it should arrive in 3 days. I’ll get to work on it then!
It’s too small, there’s no umbrella cover, and the material is average.
It's not even a large size!
The second Totes: 1. It doesn’t have a carrying case. 2. The material of the handle is average. 3. It says “Large”, but it’s actually a compact umbrella for one person. I guess two people can use it, but it’s not very comfortable.
On the other hand, the one I bought from Meituan can be used by three people without any pressure.
I don't feel very well.
First of all, the box is not very sturdy and deforms when you press on it; secondly, the design on the back does not prevent the ABS scratches on the box from appearing when it is laid flat; thirdly, the box is just a piece of cloth wrapped around a hanger; and so on, there are many things that are not satisfactory, and finally, the latch is a bit difficult to use.
PS: The wheels feel pretty good.
It is also possible.
Advantages: This shoulder bag is quite stylish and looks durable.
The drawbacks are: the QR code on the card cannot be scanned (what’s going on?), the 15.6-inch laptop cannot be put in (is it possible to make it a little bit smaller?), and the double shoulder strap can be locked, but no lock is provided for buyers; this cannot be called service-oriented.
It's okay overall, not sure if it's genuine leather
The overall feeling is okay, but I don’t know if it’s genuine leather, so I can’t really comment on it.
It can hold A4-sized documents, and has held 80-page thick, box-shaped objects (not deformable). It is likely that it cannot hold objects that are too thick or too hard.
The package is soft, and the inner bag is divided in a humanized way, which is pretty good.
The bottom I received has a small pit on it, I don’t know if it’s because my character is not good or what.
I was too lazy to go back and forth to exchange the goods, so I put up with it.
Overall, it is worth four stars.
ForRoyal, a global sensation, camera strap, SLR strap
This strap is designed to be scientific, worn on both shoulders, practical, and the camera is fixed and protected in front with soft material, unlike other quick-shooters that use screws to fix the camera at the bottom, and it is also very convenient to take the camera off.
Garbage after-sales service
I bought a guitar a month and a half ago, and it’s missing a part. After I notified Amazon, they gave me a customer service phone number, and after multiple communications, the part still hasn’t arrived. What kind of efficiency is this!
It is estimated that after-sales maintenance will be more troublesome, so I suggest that those who value good after-sales service should take a different route; it is too much trouble!
It has some minor flaws, but the sound quality is good.
The soundboard has a defect, it lacks a corner, and it feels like a substandard product, and there are no gifts, but at this price it’s not bad, and the sound is good.
Okay, first invoice.
It has been used for a long time, and overall it is not bad except for the fact that the bass cannot come out.
The workmanship is not as perfect as I imagined.
The first time I bought it, the product had problems, all the lights were flashing and it didn't work.
I asked for a replacement, but it took three days for the goods to arrive in Shanghai and they still haven’t been delivered.
I also called the delivery person, but they didn't answer.
The courier company said that they only had that contact information.
Amazon can’t find where to complain.
I received a message saying that there was no request for a delay in delivery, but the delivery was delayed anyway at my request - for no apparent reason.
Then they talked about the issue of transit.
In any case, the poor shopping experience made me start to doubt the effectiveness of Amazon’s logistics and control systems.
It is estimated that it will not arrive today.
The adhesive is too weak and it is not waterproof.
Although the Bluetooth connection is convenient, the printed content is not waterproof and the surface is not coated; the adhesive strength of the labels is poor, and they are not suitable for cable labels at all; they are very easy to fall off, so friends who buy them to organize cables need to pay attention to this.
The pen is fine, but the packaging is very basic - just a cardboard box with no protection, and the box the pen is in is stuck together with a large piece of transparent tape, leaving tape on the box.
Treating a 600 yuan item like this, it was a disappointing shopping experience.
However, the pen is not a problem.
I hope they improve the packaging in the future!
In terms of quality, if we talk about writing, 925-25 is better.
First, let me praise the excellent service of TNT, air shipments are delivered incredibly fast and the service attitude is great!
I have been using the 925-25 and it is great. I just received the 925-85 and the quality is excellent, and the design is beautiful. I gave it four stars because the pen is a bit heavy and not suitable for fast writing, and there is a bit of wobbling when adjusting the length of the lead inside the pen cap. In my opinion, the 925-25 is more comfortable to use.
Therefore, he became an Amazon loyalist.
I bought it at a super discounted price, but my child doesn’t like it.
It was already opened, but I tried to apply for a refund and they even offered to pick it up for free.
This is amazing.
We do not advocate returns, but this is a service that is unique to us in China.
I hope it is not abused.
I bought all the books that came after that and moved my base of operations here.
The headphones have a distortion and noise
These headphones are really bad. I don't know if it's my ears or if these headphones are just not as good as they used to be.
I bought a blue one two years ago on JD.com, and the sound quality is good with no noise or bass problems. I’ve been using it for more than two years and it’s about to break, so I plan to buy another one (urbeats). After all, I think it’s a good product.
I also saw one that looked nice in purple, but when I opened it today, I felt it was not right; it was both loud and quiet at the same time.
At first, I thought it was because of the sound effect of the song, but after listening for half a day, I realized that the problem was serious. Not only was the sound distorted, but the bass effect was not as good as before, and there were some noise as well. Is this only happening to the purple one I bought, or is the manufacturing process of the headphones really not up to par now?
A pretty poor review, I'm disappointed.
I definitely need to return it tomorrow.
PS looks good.
This AV amplifier is complicated to set up, has a rough exterior, and generates a lot of heat.
I will comment on the sound after some time has passed!
On August 14, I just got the German version of the DN1080. It looks poorly made.
1. The front panel and the knobs are all made of plastic.
2. The back panel audio input jack and speaker output terminals are of poor quality; any CD amplifier unit priced between 1000 and 2000 yuan is much better than this one.
3. The top cover is quite thin, and it has even sunk in on my transformer, so I had to open the box and use my hands to fix it, and the top cover and front panel became loose.
4. The center of gravity of the whole machine is biased towards the transformer end, and it is awkward to move.
It feels like a SONY entry-level machine, in terms of workmanship, made in Malaysia.
I feel that Sony is much better at outsourcing production to China.
5. The machine is very hot. When watching a movie on two channels for about two hours, the top cover feels about 40-50°C when touched with your hand. I don’t know if the transformer is too big and generates a lot of heat.
Nowadays, most people use switching power supplies, and this stupid transformer probably weighs 4 kg.
Sony should have used a passive heat sink fan inside the machine, but all I see after opening the box is a large aluminum heat sink plate.

I have not opened it.
The battery is in use.
I really want to dissect it and see what's inside.
Later, I thought that if I was disappointed after opening it, it would be a waste of money; if I was satisfied after opening it, it would be difficult to put it back in the box and I would not like it anymore.
Okay, even if Sony uses good batteries.
As for the detailed explanation of the battery, most people would feel uneasy.
I'm fine. I used to work in a cell phone factory, so I'm half a battery engineer and can handle it, except for not understanding circuits.
Delighted.
I really had no idea what I was buying until I opened the package and felt that it was genuine!
Finally, when I touched the earphone wire, I felt it was very flexible, and the quality was so good that I couldn’t wait to plug it into my phone and open QQ Music.
I was shocked, the sound quality was 3D surround!
I asked in a physical communication store, and it costs around 30 yuan, but it is not a branded product, but a generic one, so I would say that although this Peng Sheng product costs 27 yuan, it is definitely worth having because of its value for money!
The worst online shopping experience.
After placing an order on September 28th, the system showed that the order had been shipped, but the package was never delivered until October 12th.
I queried the status of my Amazon order, but the seller did not provide a tracking number, so I couldn’t find out where the order was.
So I emailed the seller to ask if they could provide the tracking number, but I never received a reply after two days.
In desperation, I called Amazon customer service, and they gave me the seller’s phone number. I called the seller, and after a few attempts, the call went through. I was informed that the package was lost and that they could send me a new one right away.
Although I was very angry, I didn’t say much to the seller because I needed the computer urgently. I just asked them to send it to me right away.
The next day, I called to ask if the package had been shipped.
The seller said it hasn't been sent yet and won't be sent until this afternoon.
I called again in the afternoon and the seller said it would be sent, but it wouldn’t be sent until after 5 or 6 pm. When I called back at 7 pm, the phone just rang and no one answered.
The third day morning, I called again and asked if the goods had been sent out.
Can you tell me the order number?
The seller said it hasn't been sent yet, and told me to order from another store if I was in a hurry, or wait until the afternoon if I could wait.
There’s no way, I have to wait a long time to place an order from another store.
I can only ask the seller to send the package as soon as possible.
After countless phone follow-ups, I finally received my computer on October 16th.
As for the quality of the computer, I don’t know because it was for someone else, so I’ll add a review later.
I bought it half a year ago and have only used it a few times. Now it is malfunctioning. Can you fix it?
Because I have a desktop computer, I haven’t used it much since I bought it.
I only take it out of my suitcase when I am on a business trip.
When the power was recently turned on, it did not charge. You need to support the charging port and the cable with your hands to the left and right to charge it.
I suspect that there is a problem with the interface, and I don’t know if it can be repaired now?
It is strongly recommended that Amazon stop using EMS!
The product is five stars, the logistics is one star, and the average is three stars.
I don’t understand why Amazon would send EMS, which is not trusted by the industry; well, computers are valuable items after all!
The order after purchase showed that it would be delivered on the 20th, so my family waited at home for three days!
Why does it take four or five days to send a package from Xiamen to Fuzhou?!
On the 22nd morning, the logistics arrived in Fuzhou at last, and I was ready to receive the package happily. However, that night, without receiving any phone call or message, I checked the logistics and found that it had been signed for at noon, and it even showed that I had signed for it myself!
I was shocked at that moment!
Who am I? Where am I? Is this computer really mine?
I seriously doubt life now!
I finally ran to a collection point to bring the computer back.
The specific reason is that the delivery person mixed up the two order numbers, but fortunately the package was not lost.
I strongly suggest that Amazon should not use EMS anymore. If Amazon uses EMS for its express delivery in the future, I will definitely not buy from them again.
The goods are not bad.
First of all, I bought it a few days ago and found that it was reduced in price, and I left a bad review. The product is not bad, it has a good price-performance ratio, and the CPU and graphics card are enough to handle mainstream online games and a considerable number of large single-player games. The heat dissipation is very good, but the screen is a little dim (a common problem with IPS screens), the sound quality is not good, and the hard drive is not good (I suggest you spend a little money to get a solid-state drive). I took the computer to the after-sales service center yesterday to have the hardware checked, and there were no problems. The pre-installed Windows 8.1 is not very good, and I recommend upgrading to 10. The seller shipped the product quickly, and replied to my inquiries very quickly. I received the invoice the day after I received the computer, which is good. It’s a shame that there were no gifts.
(By the way, if you want to buy keyboard skins, don’t go to a store called E Cool Digital Center on Taobao; they are slow to ship, the quality is poor, they don’t refund or replace products if there are problems, and the boss swears a lot; I’m warning you specifically).
The products are good, but the platform is still bureaucratic.
The hard drive is of very good quality and has an excellent price-to-performance ratio. If you don’t need it right away and can tolerate the shipping, I would definitely recommend purchasing it. It’s cheaper than buying one in Hong Kong.
But I have to say that the bureaucracy on the Amazon platform is still the same as it was a few years ago when I swore I would never use it again. You can never find out the actual status of your shipment, and you will always receive your package several weeks later. You can never complain, it’s just so bureaucratic!
The goods have been delivered a few days ago, but the logistics information says you will receive the goods in 10 days!
Logistics is not selfish.
It came like this, not only was the packaging crushed, but the electrical packaging was also open, and I don’t know if it was tampered with.
FYI
I have always trusted Philips, and I hope the battery life is longer than other brands. I haven’t tried it yet.
After searching online, I found that this is a common problem with this model and it is not covered by the warranty.
I'm so sad!
Now I wrap it in plastic wrap and continue to use it, but I don’t know how long it will last.
Bought from someone who has already taken it apart.
It is indeed expensive to pay more than 100 yuan in tax for a machine that costs more than 300 yuan; now I feel more at ease.
When I received it, the seal looked like it had been opened, so I took a photo first. Sure enough, it was easily torn open. After opening it, I found that the paper inside was damaged. I was worried that it was returned by someone else, so I quickly tried it out on my husband before the anniversary. Unfortunately, the machine didn’t turn on at all. Fortunately, there was no debris inside the blade. Otherwise, I would have had to return it from a long distance!
It is not known whether it is good to use or whether there will be any problems in the short term; as mentioned in the previous review, the products that are out of stock are not reliable!
The experience is slightly above average.
It’s pretty much top-of-the-line electric toothbrushes, with a lot of different brushing modes, but few people change modes every day.
I used it for half a year without any problems. I brush it every day and charge it once every 1.5 weeks.
The brush heads are also cheaper on Amazon.
The app is a bit difficult to use. Except for changing the colors, the other issues that seem to be compatible are due to the overseas version?
Those who want to learn the Great Law.
It is very cost-effective.
I have used it 3-4 times already.
1. The packaging is in good condition.
2. It is very simple to use and easy to clean.
3、 You can do your own haircut, which saves money.
Overall, a very successful purchase.
There are counterfeit products.
Last time I bought two packs, and they turned out to be two different versions. The words in the lower left corner of the packaging were green, but one of them was not, and the words were white. The cat got sick after eating it.
I am not sure whether the products on Amazon are fake or if they were dropped by employees during shipping.
I will buy from you again, but if it is a fake, I will hold you responsible.
It's a crossbar!
The picture on Amazon shows a hyphen, but you sent me a horizontal line. Isn’t that cheating?
The effect is not bad.
The most important thing is that Kitty likes to eat.
It really works.
Tight, narrow, and with bunions and calluses.
Not recommended.
1. The UN series is the most comfortable series for Clarks, but unfortunately this one is too bad.
Additional note: I compared the UN series foot cushions (the shoes were thrown away but the cushions were kept) from before, and the material is much worse than before, the elasticity is not as good as before, and the breathability is not as good as before, they are just fake soft.
2. My heels are not very high, and the point where I kick is about 3 inches forward from the highest point of my heels.
3. I bought three pairs of Clarks shoes from overseas, but only one pair fits.
I was so scared that I deleted all the songs in my playlist.
Try rockport again, if it doesn’t work, you can only go to the Ecco physical store.
Second-rate substitutes, poor quality control
First of all, it is worth mentioning that Prime overseas purchases are really great, and I received my order on the 6th after placing it on the 31st.
The shoes are much more beautiful than the picture shows, and the texture is nice.
The shoe size is slightly larger, 25 is 10.5 wide and 7.5 deep, and it feels a little loose when I put it on, but I usually like to wear slightly loose shoes, and I put in a pair of insoles just right.
Secondly, the shoes are really not worth praising. One of the soles had a damaged adhesive, while the other had various scratches and pinholes, and the adhesive strip at the connection point between the upper and the sole was misaligned, which was blatantly shoddy work!
I regret it a little!
If you buy it for the activity price of 280 yuan, it’s a pretty good deal for Arthus; of course, there are even lower prices if you look at the reviews.
Now let’s talk about the shoes. The pros: the shoes are light, running in them is comfortable, and they fit well and don’t fall apart.
It looks great, but the flaws are also obvious: I usually wear a size 40, but I bought a 40.5 this time, and there is about the width of a thumb between the front of the shoe and my foot when I put it on, but that doesn’t matter.
These shoes are very "narrow," although there is still some space in front, but they feel tight.
There is one more thing, the shoes are not breathable and I feel like my feet are hot.
Heel pad.
First of all, the shoes are well made and worth the price.
My feet are standard size, I wear size uk7.5 for running shoes and uk6.5 for casual shoes, and I have bought a few pairs of shoes from Amazon’s Aibee, and they have never been uncomfortable to wear; however, I bought these shoes according to the reviews, and they are size uk7, which is one size larger than I usually wear. After wearing them, I found that they are noticeably longer than usual, but the thick insole makes my feet feel cramped, and the shoes are also very hard, which makes walking in them very uncomfortable.
If your feet are not particularly thin, I would not recommend buying this product.
If you must buy them, you can replace the insoles, but the original insoles look very high-end, so it’s a shame.
A very perfect shopping experience!
I am very satisfied and love Amazon Global Store, which sells authentic products without a doubt; the quality is also very good and the price is reasonable; I feel safe when I buy from Amazon; the after-sales service is very thoughtful and the customer service staff are friendly and patient; they solve problems efficiently and effectively, which completely relieves my worries; the delivery service is very convenient and reliable; the delivery person is very thoughtful and will remind customers to pick up their orders from the delivery box in a timely manner; thank you, Amazon, for providing such a comfortable shopping experience for customers.
In short, our whole family loves shopping on Amazon Global!
Absolutely negative review!
It is truly ridiculous for this agency and Amazon.
In the future, be careful when buying electronic products on Amazon.
Although it has been a long time, I still have to complain.
I bought it on sale during the winter for less than 200 yuan, and I haven’t used it at home for a few months.
When I needed it in the spring, I couldn't connect it to my watch, and both manuals said they supported each other. Later, I found out it was a problem with the heart rate monitor, because I couldn't connect it to any other device.
I called Amazon and asked them to contact the agent company, which told me to send the device to Shanghai for testing at my own expense.
After almost half a month, the items were sent back to me in their original condition, including the shipping box I used to send them!
No response or feedback, and no test reports!
You should at least tell me whether it’s good or bad!
I called to ask, and they said that sending it back in this way means that the device is fine, which is good.
But I still can’t connect, and the agency responds: It’s not their problem.
I feel sorry for myself, I don't want to be bothered for something that costs 200 yuan.
There is a serious mismatch between supply and demand.
It's a case of the wrong product at the wrong time.
The headband material is of good quality.
It's much better than Nike.
It is also breathable.
Just that hat up there.
Very fine.
Are you trying to be funny?!
It completely blocks out the sun.
I didn't return it because the headband function is good.
It can be worn on the head, but it doesn't block the sun.
But it is different from other headband styles.
Save it for later.
The quality of the products is good, Amazon lacks a sense of contract, and the delivery person is great.
I require delivery on Saturday and Sunday!
Amazon’s rules do not allow deliveries on Saturdays or Sundays.
I had to drive 200 kilometers from the countryside to come and pick it up!
Amazon, how can I love you more?
The delivery person was very active and enthusiastic.
Give it a thumbs up!
The goods, I tried them out and they are not bad.
But I have never bought similar products before, so I can’t compare prices!
Size and logistics
The workmanship is good, but the delivery is too slow. Previously, all the shoes were delivered by DHL. This time, Apex is really... I’ve bought a lot of UA in China, and the prices are not low. I feel that the quality is higher than NIKE and ADIDAS?
They are all the same, so I shop online.
Size: I am 176cm tall and weigh 68kg. My shoulders are usually 180cm wide, and I bought a size M. The hem is slightly long. Everything else fits perfectly. I see that there are recommendations for size S. Is your build so slender that you prefer a size S? I think a looser-fitting shirt would be better.
Just the right size.
Chest size: 99, height: 184 cm, weight: 84 kg, before purchasing, I consulted customer service and was told to buy XL, then I decided to buy L after reading the reviews, and when I received the package, I found that it was the right size, I almost got scammed.
The prices of Double 11 are much higher than those of Black Friday.
The quality of the clothes is very good.
The problem with Z affordable goods is troublesome!
The package arrived on the 25th, 18 days after I placed the order, which is the speed of snails from Guangzhou to Beijing!
I bought this product because it was cheap, and the description said it had scratches, but when I received the package, I found that 4 screws and nuts were missing!
The child didn’t want to return the item, thinking it wasn’t a big deal, but the accessory is a small part and the child’s grandfather couldn’t find it in any of the hardware stores nearby!
Finally, Grandpa did it!
It seems that we can’t buy Z products at a good price anymore!
The toy is of poor quality.
Most of the screw holes were not aligned, and it was difficult to screw them in, indicating poor workmanship. It is not clear how long it can be used, as it was a promise made to the child, so it cannot be returned.
Other reviews say it was easy to install, so is it just my one that has a problem?
It's pretty average.
Is it just bad luck for me?
The packaging is outdated; the workmanship is poor; there is only one type of music and it is only 8 seconds long and then repeats; the action is just nodding your head and walking forward, with no changes.
Not worth the price.
If you need it urgently, you can’t return it.
The toy is of good quality, but I have some complaints about the packaging.
I received the package delivered by EMS yesterday, which was purchased from Amazon. It was finally delivered by the courier of Tmall. How many twists and turns did it go through? Is the relationship between Amazon and Tmall good?
As for the packaging, it is wrapped in several layers of plastic wrap, and there is not even a piece of plastic foam inside. When you open it, all the parts are placed in an empty box. Fortunately, the toy is of good quality and there are no broken parts, but it is smaller than I expected because it does not come with a battery, and it often derails when pushed by hand because the track gaps are too large, which is an unreasonable design.
Good quality, fun to play.
It’s a lot of fun, the components are very precise and well-made, and the quality is almost the same as Lego. The price is very reasonable for events.
The process of assembling it was quite interesting, and my 5-year-old son came to play with me, which was great.
He laughed and laughed while playing with it, and he will probably continue to buy toys of this brand in the future.
The phone is new and I bought it from overseas, which is great.
I watched it for Christmas, and it was 150 yuan more expensive than before, but it’s been a while since it was shipped.
The machines are good, they are all new.
A built-in Pikachu.
Then if you connect the spirit balls, you will receive a dream.
It’s fun to play, and it’s more portable than a PS4.
I have already bought Zelda, I’ll try it again after playing it.
Producing bad products, selling bad products, and as a result, providing bad services. The six watches I bought to give to my children were not completely accurate, and the time on all six watches was inconsistent, differing by a dozen or so hours.
I contacted the manufacturer and asked if there was a verification time for the watches when they were put into storage. They replied that there was. If there was, then why was there such a big difference in time? It was obvious that the watches were not accurate and were counterfeit products. It’s not that I find it hard to say, but it’s obvious that there are quality issues (the digital display is not complete). They even sell them like this. Aren’t they garbage?
I contacted the seller, who gave me a lot of reasons, and also complained that I shouldn’t have bought their products in the first place, products like these, from sellers like these, with after-sales service like this, who would dare to buy anything on Amazon in the future.
In short, I recommend not to buy anything from this seller, even if you do, it will be junk.
Amazon shipping problems
After receiving the goods, the inspection found:
1. The box is severely damaged.
2. The table instructions have serious wrinkles.
3. The clock does not have a battery and cannot be adjusted.
4. Contact Amazon customer service separately, and you can only ship it to the US at your own expense, and you will be reimbursed for the shipping fee.
5、The reason for 2 points is that the customer service is still good.
It's just barely acceptable.
The time is not very accurate, about a second fast per day, and it has been almost two and a half months since I started using it.
I used a Seatown watch before and I think it won’t be off by a few seconds in a year or two.
The calendar function is quite good, but the timer function is useless and you accidentally enter the timer mode from time to time.
Solar-powered watch
Advantages: solar charging, no need to worry about replacing batteries, world time, multiple alarm sounds and reminders at the hour.
The downside: mirrors are easy to scratch and get dusty.
Value for money: domestic prices are generally between 220 and 300 yuan, and overseas purchases cost over 180 yuan (delivery takes about a week).
Very satisfied with the watch.
It must be the real thing, I checked it at the specialty store, the appearance of the watch is beautiful, the workmanship is exquisite, the materials are of good quality, and it is an imported mechanical movement, so it has some weight to it; it is not something that so-called mechanical watches of three or four hundred yuan can compare with, this is the real deal.
The watch is very accurate in terms of timing, with errors well within acceptable limits. The watch comes with a jewelry certification, and the 12 on the dial is indeed a real diamond. It’s perfect for me to wear, and it’s also a great gift.
The Benelli shotgun is indeed good.
The worst shopping experience ever.
On the evening of September 23, my wife dropped her phone, so I immediately ordered an 8P from Amazon Malaysia. The product was in stock, but it was not self-sold and there was no markup (I was secretly happy), and because it was not self-sold, the delivery was slower. The system showed that the product was expected to be delivered by September 27 at the latest.
My wife, who couldn’t stand it, died of boredom. Early in the morning at around 6:30 the next day, she asked me to find a solution. Later, when I checked JD.com, I found that there were 256G models in stock and could be delivered the same day. So I immediately ordered another one.
I bought a new one and immediately wanted to cancel the Amazon order.
Since the order was placed in the middle of the night, it was impossible to pick up the package in the morning, so at around 7:00, I called customer service to cancel the order, and the customer service representative replied that the order had been canceled and that I should wait for a text message confirmation.
Okay, I’ll wait patiently. When I checked my phone at noon, the order was still in the “not shipped” status, so I immediately contacted customer service to request that they cancel the order as soon as possible. The customer service representative replied that the operation was OK.
When I checked my phone at 3 pm, the order was still there. I had no choice but to contact customer service again to clarify that I had called three times, and asked them to cancel the order and inform the seller not to ship the goods!
The customer service representative contacted the seller on my request and informed me that the seller was not familiar with the system and that I would have to wait until the seller was familiar with the system before the order could be canceled.
However, I have clearly informed the seller, and you can rest assured that the goods will not be shipped.
I checked the order status on Monday and found that it had already been shipped, leaving me speechless.
Unable to contact the seller directly, I had to call customer service again.
The handling afterwards was simply ridiculous; basically, I would say one thing, and the customer service representative would then do something else.
The order is still in the rejected state, and we are preparing to send it again!
Won’t Amazon proactively follow up?
The seller’s company has already received the money, so it doesn’t matter if they don’t follow up.
In summary, we will never prepay for large items in the future, this is too much trouble.
It looks beautiful.
I had my eye on this camera a long time ago, but I didn’t buy it because of some other reasons besides the price. This time, I bought it because it was included in the free shipping package, and the price was still reasonable.
After I bought it, there were no other problems, but when I tried to connect the software, I couldn’t connect. My router is a TP router, and after searching online, I found that many people had this problem. I spent more than two hours changing the settings on the router, and finally I was able to connect using 360WIFI as a medium. I called the Mi customer service, but they didn’t have any solutions for this problem, so they told me to contact Amazon for after-sales service.
Another thing worth noting is that I saw users’ comments online saying that the camera supports memory cards with a minimum capacity of 8G, and those with smaller storage capacity cannot be recognized, so please be aware of this.
It’s not bad to use, and the image is acceptable, but the sound quality is poor, and the machine gets quite hot, which is a bit hard to accept if you leave it on all the time.
As mentioned above, this product has many shortcomings, so please be careful when you buy it.
I gave it 3 stars because I bought this for my first love, we were together for almost 3 years, and he left me last year. It’s still hard to accept.
I gave it 3 stars because I bought it for my first love, but I don’t know if I’ll ever use it again, or maybe I’ve thrown it away!
We had been together for almost 3 years, and she left me last year. Whenever I think of her, I feel so sad that I want to leave this world. The first woman in my life, who brought me shadows and sadness that I have not been able to get over to this day.
When I bought this phone, I thought that we could bear it together, but now it’s regrettable. Maybe life is like this. There are some people you don’t want to meet in your life, and there are some things you don’t want to know. But what can you do?
Whenever I see a Samsung phone, I think of her; the pain that comes with it fills my entire body. I have never been willing to spend more than 2,000 yuan on a phone, but when I bought one for her, I did not hesitate. No matter how much I love someone, however, if they change their mind, all the promises and vows in the world will be meaningless.
High-quality products among domestic brands
Huawei is a premium product among domestic products.
The low-key CEO and the company rely on technology and quality to win customers, which is completely different from the current business trend of relying on advertising to increase brand awareness!
Enterprises without strength are absolutely not able to do this, and they dare not do this!
It is precisely because of this that I chose Huawei.
I bought it more than half a year ago and it has been working great, it's really good.
The reason I didn’t give it a perfect score is because once, when using its offline navigation, it had a positioning problem, and I couldn’t find the cause. Other times it worked fine.
Moreover, it is convenient to input the destination online, and after searching, it automatically designs the route. When you leave the Wi-Fi area, its offline navigation function is very useful. You don’t need to use your data plan. It directly communicates with the satellite to achieve location and navigation, which is great!
Sony is great.
Sony’s low-end phones still have a great design, are affordable, have large screens, and have excellent battery life, making them perfect for the elderly.
Although a long time has passed, this machine still works perfectly.
However, since my Z2 was released, this phone has fulfilled its mission.
