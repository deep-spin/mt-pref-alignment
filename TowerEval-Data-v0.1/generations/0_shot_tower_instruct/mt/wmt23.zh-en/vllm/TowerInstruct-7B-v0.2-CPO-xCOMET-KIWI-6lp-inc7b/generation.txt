4-word summary
4.1 Overview
The characters in this document are encoded in single, double, or quadruple bytes.
The single-byte part contains all 128 characters from GB/T 11383-1989, from 0x00 to 0x7F.
4.3 Two-byte part
The double-byte part includes all the graphic characters in GB/T 2312-1980, the CJK unified characters in GB/T 13000, and some graphic characters.
The characters in the double-byte portion are defined according to Appendix A.
In particular, the graphic, code position and function of the symbolic character description should conform to the provisions of Appendix B.
Note: GB/T 13000 is a unified code for Chinese characters used in countries and regions such as China, Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam.
Chinese characters with unique abstract shapes are assigned a separate code position; Chinese characters with different abstract shapes but the same source are assigned a shared code position.
The encoded characters are called CJK Unified Ideographs, where CJK stands for China, Japan, and Korea.
4.4 Four-character part
The four-byte part includes 66 CJK Unified Hanzi (9FA6 to 9FEF, excluding the 8 characters from 9FB4 to 9FBB) in GB/T 13000, CJK Unified Hanzi Expansion A, CJK Unified Hanzi Expansion BCJK, CJK Unified Hanzi Expansion C, CJK Unified Hanzi Expansion DCJK, and CJK Unified Hanzi Expansion F, as well as characters of ethnic minority scripts that have already been encoded in GB/T 13000.
The characters in the four-character part are defined in Appendix C.
5 Overall structure
In the main text, the ones preceded by 0x are in hexadecimal, and the ones without 0x are in decimal.
In the appendix, all coded representations are in hexadecimal, and all other representations are in decimal.
The single-byte part uses the coding structure of GB/T 11383-1989, using code points from 0x00 to 0x7F.
The bi-character Gong part uses two eight-bit binary positions to represent a character, with the first byte code ranging from 0x81 to 0xFE, and the last byte code ranging from 0x40 to 0x7E and 0x80 to 0xFE.
The four-byte part uses 0x30 and 0x39, which are not used in GB/T 11383-1989, as a suffix for expanding the two-byte code, with a coding range of 0x81308130 to 0xFE39FE39.
The first character of a four-character string is encoded in the range of 0x81 to 0xFE; the second character is encoded in the range of 0x30 to 0x39; the third character is encoded in the range of 0x81 to 0xFE; and the fourth character is encoded in the range of 0x30 to 0x39. That is, 0x81308130 to 0x81308139; 0x81308230 to 0x81308239; 0x8130FEFE30 to 0x8130FE39; 0x81318130 to 0x81318139; “0URo23061393 0xFE39FE30 to 0xFE39FE39.

The content of this page is taken from the complete documentation of the GNU C compiler, and is limited to explaining the meaning of options.
Unless someone volunteers to maintain it, the EURo file is the authoritative document.
If you find any discrepancies between the pages of the manual and the software, please check the Info
If we find that the content of this page is so outdated as to cause obvious confusion and complaints, we will stop publishing it. There is no other option, such as updating the Info file while updating the man pages, because other work maintaining Gnu cc does not leave us time to do this. The GNU project believes that the man pages are outdated and should be used elsewhere.
If you need complete and up-to-date documentation, please refer to the Info file `gee' or the manual Using and Porting GNU CC (for version 2.0) (ft&/HAIZE#H GNU CC 2.0). Both are derived from the original Texinfo file gee. texinfo.
The C and C++ compilers are integrated. They both require one or more of the four steps to process input files: preprocessing, Hii (compilation), (assembly) MERE (linking).
The suffix identifies the language of the source file, but for the compiler, the suffix controls the default settings:
gcc considers the preprocessed file (.i) as a C file and sets the connection in C format,
g++ considers the preprocessed file (.i) to be a C++ file and sets up the connection in C++ form.
The source file suffix indicates the type of language and the post-processing:
.c C source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.C C++ source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.cc C++ source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
CXX C++ source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.m Objective-C source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.i preprocessed C file; compile, assemble
.ii preprocessed C++ files; compilation, assembly
.s assembly language source program; assembly
Compile the language source program; preprocessing, assembly.
.h preprocessor file; it is usually not shown on the command line. Other files with the same suffix are passed to the linker. They usually include:
.0 Object file
.a Archive File
Unless the -cec, -s, or -E options are used (or a compilation error prevents the entire process), linking is always the final step.
During linking, all the.e files corresponding to the source program, -1 library files, and unrecognizable file names (including specified.o H header files and.a library files) are passed to the linker options (OPTIONS) in the order specified in the command line.
Options must be given separately: de ' is not the same as `-d -r '.
Most of the `=-E: and `-W' options have two opposite formats: `-fname' and `-fno-name' (or `-Wname' and `-Wno-name').
Only the formats that are not the default are listed here.
Below is a summary of all the options, grouped by type, with explanations in the following sections.
Code Generation Option
Overall Option
Specify that the language of the file you are about to enter is language (rather than the default selection derived from the file name).
This option applies to all subsequent input files until the next optional `-x' option .language.
Close any explicit language indication, and thus the file RE AS E ` -x' option based on the file name after post-processing).
If you only want to operate on a part of the four stages (preprocessing, compilation, assembly, linking), you can use the `-x' option (or the Ah file name) to tell GCC where to start, and `-c', `-s', or `-E' options to tell GCC where to end. Note that some combinations of options (for example, `-x cpp-output -E') tell GCC to compile or assemble the source file. If ETER. ERA ATI is not specified, GCC will use `.o' to replace the source file name with `.ec' as the target file name. You can use the `-o' option to choose other names. GCC ignores any unrecognizable input files after the `-ec' option.
The target file has been deleted.
Translation stops when it is done, without compiling the output.
Work with pipes instead of temporary files at different stages of the compilation process, because the assemblers of those systems cannot read data from pipes, GNU's assembler does not have this problem, and the assembler's "dialect" of C that it can accept: it supports C programs that conform to the ANSI standard.
This will close some features in GNU Cc that are not compatible with ANSI Cc, as well as features such as the ANSI trigraph features that are rarely used, such as unix and vax, and prohibit the use of (note: in a hosted environment, all standard libraries are available, and the main function returns an int value, which is typical for almost all programs except for the kernel. In the corresponding freestanding environment, there are no standard libraries, and the program entry point is not necessarily main. The most obvious example is the operating system kernel. For more information, see the latest information on the gcc website)
For function declarations without parameters, such as `int foo ();', C-style is used - that is, no number or type of parameters is specified. (This applies only to C++).
Normally, such a function foo in C++ means that the parameter is empty.
The New List of Sections Abridged here attempts to support certain aspects of traditional C compilers.
See the NU c manual for details, which we have removed to avoid people HERI when the content becomes outdated.
Except for one thing: for C++ programs (not C), the `-traditional' option has an additional effect, allowing this to be assigned.
He and the `-Ethis-is-variable' option are the same.
-traditional-cpp attempts to support some aspects of the traditional C preprocessor.
In particular, the above refers to the preprocessor, but does not include the other effects of the `-traditional' option.
-fdollars-in-identifiers Allows the use of `$' characters in identifiers (C++ only).
You can specify the `-Eno-dollars-in-identifiers' option to indicate that the use of `$' is prohibited.
(GNU C++ allows the `$' character by default on some target systems, but not on all.)
-fenum-int-equiv allows implicit conversions from an enum type to an integer type (MEF C++).
Normally, GNU C++ allows the conversion from enum to int, but not the other way around.
-fexternal-—templates generates smaller code for template declarations (only for C++), by creating a copy of each template function only where it is defined.
To successfully use this option, you must mark `#pragma implementation` (define) or `#pragma interface` (declare) in all files that use the template.
When compiling with the `-fexternal-templates' option, all template instantiations are external types. You must make the necessary instances appear in the implementation files.
This can be achieved through typedef, which references each instance as needed.
Correspondingly, if the default option `-fno-extern-templates` is used during compilation, all template instances are explicitly set as built-in.
All member functions (except for constructor functions and the mnew or delete member operators) are considered to be virtual functions of their class.
This does not mean that every call to a member function will go through the internal vtable.
In some cases, the compiler can determine that a virtual function can be called directly; in this case, it is called directly.
-fcond-mismatch Allows the types of the second and third parameters of the conditional expression to be different.
The value of this kind of expression is Void.-fthis-—is-variable, which allows you to assign a value to this (for C++ only).
Merging the user-defined free storage management mechanism into C++ makes the assignable `this` out of place.
Therefore, by default, the assignment of this inside a class member function is an invalid operation.
However, for backward compatibility, you can make this operation work by using the `-fthis-is-variable' option.
-funsigned-char defines char as an unsigned type, like unsigned char.
All machines have their own default char type, which can be either unsigned char or signed char.
Ideally, when symbolic data dependencies are involved, a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned char.
However, many programs are written to use only simple chars, and this is with a signed number (or unsigned, depending on the target machine where the program is written).
This option, and its inverse, make such a program work on the corresponding default value.
The type of char should always be explicitly defined as signed char or unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly like one of them.
If no `signed' or `unsigned' modifiers are explicitly declared, these options are used to define a signed or unsigned bit field.
By default, the bit fields are signed because the underlying integer types they inherit from, such as int, are signed. However, if the `-traditional' option is specified, the bit fields are always unsigned.
-fwritable-strings stores string constants in writable data segments and does not perform any special handling.
This is to maintain compatibility with some old programs, and they consider changing the string constant to be a very bad idea, and the `-traditional' option has the same effect.
Executive summary
The impact of COVID-19 on the drug market
Its impact may be similar to the economic crisis in 2008.
The global COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the world into an unprecedented crisis.
In many countries, the disease has overwhelmed healthcare services, leading to near-collapse, and the restrictions imposed by governments have caused severe disruption to the global economy.
The impact of the epidemic on the drug market is unclear and difficult to predict, but it could be far-reaching.
Some producers may be forced to find new ways to manufacture drugs, as restrictions on movement also limit access to precursors and essential chemicals.
Traffickers may be forced to find new routes and methods due to travel restrictions, which they are unable to cross.
The patterns of drug use and supply may change, and the government's ability to respond may be hindered.
The changes brought about by COVID-19 are unprecedented, but we can still learn from past crises.
After the 2008 economic crisis, some drug users began to look for cheaper synthetic substances and shifted to injecting drugs.
At the same time, governments have cut their drug-related budgets.
If governments respond to the current economic recession in the same way, interventions and detoxification treatment services to prevent drug use and related risky behaviors may be severely affected.
In addition, the priority of interception operations and international cooperation may be reduced, making it easier for traffickers to operate.
Some countries have a large amount of drugs smuggled through commercial flights, and it is expected that these countries will be most directly affected by drug trafficking.
Messengers carry methamphetamine and other synthetic drugs in their backpacks or hide them in their personal luggage, sometimes in large quantities. With restrictions on air travel in place almost everywhere, the use of commercial air travel to supply drugs may be completely disrupted.
Although the international postal supply chain has also been disrupted, activities involving the use of the dark web and parcel post for trafficking may increase.
In the long run, the economic recession and related lockdown measures could disrupt the drug market.
Due to the rising unemployment rate and lack of opportunities, impoverished and vulnerable people are more likely to use drugs in a harmful way, develop drug addiction, and turn to illicit activities related to drugs, whether it is production or transportation.
Drug trafficking organizations may take advantage of this situation to provide services to vulnerable people and recruit new members to grow their ranks.
As government capacity to respond diminishes, these shifts are likely to take root quickly, becoming the new reality for many communities.
Expansion and complexity
Market growth
The population growth model partly explains the reason for market expansion
Drug use has been increasing worldwide, both in terms of overall numbers and the proportion of drug users in the world's population.
In 2009, it was estimated that there were 210 million drug users, accounting for 4.8% of the global population aged between 15 and 64. In 2018, it was estimated that there were 269 million drug users, accounting for 5.3% of this population.
During the past two decades, the growth of drug addiction in developing countries has been much faster than in developed countries.
This reflects, to a certain extent, the differences in overall population growth during this period, with 7% for developed countries and 28% for developing countries, but also reflects the faster growth of the young population in developing countries.
Adolescents and young adults account for the largest proportion of drug users.
Between 2000 and 2018, the population in this age group in developing countries grew by 16%, while it decreased by 10% in developed countries.
Urbanization is a driving factor in the current and future drug markets.
In both developed and developing countries, drug use is more prevalent in urban areas than in rural areas.
Part of the reason for the overall increase in drug use is the massive shift of people from rural to urban areas, with more than half of the world's population now living in urban areas, compared to 34% in 1960.
Urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, especially in developing countries where urbanization is more pronounced.
The increase in wealth is linked to an increase in drug use, but the burden of disease is greatest among the poorest people worldwide, and drug use is more common in developed countries than in developing countries.
Drugs such as cocaine are even more firmly associated with the world's wealthier regions.
Similarly, within countries, the drug use prevalence rate is higher among the wealthy social classes.
However, the rate of conversion to drug addiction is higher among people with lower socioeconomic status.
Data from a few countries shows that there is a link between harmful drug use patterns and the disease in low-income populations.
These patterns do not seem to be as common in wealthier social classes.
The economic constraints caused by the global COVID-19 crisis are likely to exacerbate the risks faced by the most vulnerable groups, including drug users.
For example, changes in the labor market, such as an increase in unemployment, have traditionally been associated with an increase in drug use, while the pandemic has already forced millions of people worldwide out of work.
The COVID-19 pandemic may lead to further expansion of the drug market. The COVID-19 pandemic may lead to more farmers increasing or engaging in the cultivation of illicit crops, either because the state authorities' control capacity has decreased or because, in the midst of an economic crisis, more people may be forced to take risks and engage in illicit activities.
The related restrictions on COVID-19 have led to a reduction in air and land transportation, and as a result, maritime trafficking may have increased. The risk of interception at sea is low, and there are more shipments than air or land smuggling.
Recently, there have been reports that cocaine is being transported directly from South America to Europe by sea.
Complexity increased.
The situation with non-internationally controlled substances is stable, but new types of opioids with potential risks are increasing, and the drug market is becoming more complex.
In addition to plant substances such as marijuana, cocaine and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control. The non-medical use of drugs is also rapidly increasing.
There are about 500 new active substances on the domestic market of member countries every year.
Currently, the majority of them are stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid agonists and a small amount of opioids.
Although the total number of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportions have changed.
Of the total number of new psychoactive substances identified in 2014, only 2% were new psychoactive substances of the opioid type, but by 2018, this figure had risen to 9%.
Many of the new psychoactive substances in the opioid family are similar to fentanyl, and their effects and dangers have been proven, leading to overdose deaths in North America, and to a lesser extent in other regions.
In North America, fentanyl is used as a cutting agent for heroin and other drugs, including cocaine and methamphetamine, and is also used to make counterfeit prescription opioids.
Some evidence suggests that there is also injection of new psychoactive substances in Europe: a study of waste residues from syringes in six European cities found that many of the syringes contained new psychoactive substances that have a stimulating effect.
The use of new psychoactive substances may gradually become entrenched among vulnerable groups.
New psychoactive substances of a single type have almost never formed a large market.
But evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among marginalized groups such as the homeless and prison inmates.
22 countries reported the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, and most of them identified synthetic cannabinoids as the main challenge.
Control of precursor chemicals has forced drug makers to innovate. Many chemicals that were once used as precursors to manufacture amphetamines, methamphetamines and "ecstasy" have been placed under international control.
Drug traffickers and manufacturers have been looking for alternatives, not only substances with less regulation, but also chemicals designed specifically to evade regulation, known as "tailor-made precursors."
Restrictive measures aimed at stopping the spread of COVID-19 are likely to put further pressure on drug makers who rely on precursor chemicals.
Evidence from Mexico suggests this has become a reality: In March 2020, a shortage of methylphenidate precursors imported from East Asia reportedly drove up prices of methylphenidate in Mexico and the United States.
The market is constantly changing.
Synthetic drugs replace opioids in Central Asia and the Russian Federation
The opiate market in Central Asia and the Russian Federation appeared to have changed between 2008 and 2018.
The number of opioids intercepted by the authorities of the Russian Federation has decreased by about 80%, while the number of people receiving treatment for the use of opioids has decreased significantly.
But the market for performance-enhancing drugs seems to be thriving.
There is evidence that methamphetamine and various cathinones, including ephedrine and a-pyrrolidinopentiophenone, are now readily available on the Russian drug market.
Russian authorities reported that the number of secret manufacturing sites for various illicit drugs seized recently has risen sharply, more than doubling in two years, reaching 152 manufacturing sites in 2018.
Methamphetamine markets grow in Afghanistan and Iraq
As early as 2012, surveys of people in hospitals, prisons and other institutions had revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.
Crystal methamphetamine has become another major drug of concern, in addition to "fenethylline" and quomadol.
A 2015 study further confirmed these findings, with drug users saying that marijuana was harder to obtain than "fentanyl" or methamphetamine.
Recently, Iraqi authorities have discovered multiple methamphetamine processing sites, and the International Narcotics Control Board has expressed concern about the large import of pseudoephedrine drugs, which are used as precursors in methamphetamine processing sites.
In Afghanistan, methamphetamine manufacturing appears to have started in 2014.
Since then, seizures of methamphetamine have been steadily increasing.
However, the seizure volume in the first half of 2019 was 657 kg - a significant increase compared to the previous year.
Large quantities of methamphetamine believed to originate from Afghanistan have been seized in other countries, which also indicates that the country's production is rapidly increasing.
Policy changes and trends of change
The majority of jurisdictions that have legalized the non-medical use of cannabis have seen an increase in its use.
Eleven jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay, and the United States allow the manufacture of cannabis products for non-medical use.
In most of these jurisdictions, cannabis use has increased since it was legalized, although the same trend has been observed in other jurisdictions that have not legalized non-medical cannabis use.
In Colorado and Washington, the two states that were the first to pass legislation in the United States, the number of adults using marijuana for non-medical purposes has increased, especially in the past month and those who use it daily or almost daily, which has exceeded the national average since 2012.
All indicators show that since 2011, marijuana use in Uruguay has increased, with use almost doubling last month.
This indicates that the main reason for the increase is the regular and frequent use of cannabis.
Short-term data from Canada also shows that while the legal market expanded from 2018 to 2019, use was also increasing.
However, in 2019, 40% of marijuana users still obtained some products from illegal sources.
Is the reason behind the sharp drop in global cannabis herb seizures the legalization of cannabis?
In 2018, global cannabis herb seizures fell to their lowest level in 20 years, due to a decline in seizures in North America, which fell by 84% over the past 10 years.
In comparison, seizures in other parts of the world during the same period almost doubled. The pattern of seizures indicates that policies aimed at liberalizing the marijuana market played a key role in the decline.
The regulation of new psychoactive substances seems to have a deterrent effect, but it is still difficult to assess the effectiveness of the regulation of new psychoactive substances in China.
Some countries that have different regulatory systems for new psychoactive substances show different prevalence rates of use of new psychoactive substances.
In other countries, the use of new psychoactive substances has decreased after domestic legislation was passed.
Vulnerable groups face harm from both legal and illegal drug markets. Medicinal opioids used for pain management and palliative care are mainly available in high-income countries. The distribution of pain medication is uneven across regions.
In 2018, more than 90% of all pharmaceutical opioids available for medical consumption were in high-income countries.
Approximately 50% are in North America, 40% in Europe, and 2% in Oceania.
The population of these countries accounts for about 12% of the global population.
It is estimated that the population of low-income and middle-income countries accounts for 88% of the global population, but the consumption of pharmaceutical opioids accounts for less than 10%.
Obstacles to obtaining prescription opioids are related to many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems, and prescribing practices.
People who are poorer are more at risk of addiction. In 2018, around 35.6 million people were addicted to drugs.
Poverty, limited education, and social marginalization may increase the risk of and exacerbate the consequences of drug addiction. This has been confirmed by research in high-income countries, where individual socio-economic trajectories are not only related to their status at a given point in time, but also to the risk of drug addiction.
Drug addiction also deepens socio-economic disadvantage, further increasing the risk of unemployment, poverty and homelessness, thereby fuelling a vicious cycle of disadvantage. These outcomes may also be linked to stigmatising attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.
Women, ethnic minorities and migrants, sexual and gender diverse groups, people displaced by armed conflict or disasters, and those living in rural environments may also be disproportionately affected by drug use disorders or face challenges in accessing treatment services.
According to the disability-adjusted life years (DALY) indicator, which estimates the number of healthy years of life lost due to disability and premature death, harmful drug use has had a wider social impact over the past 10 years.
From 2007 to 2018, the global disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to drug use increased by 17%.
The increase in the number of years of life adjusted for disability associated with hepatocellular carcinoma in untreated injecting drug users with hepatitis C is particularly high - up to 40%.
The relationship between drugs and violence is complex, and it is difficult to determine all the causal relationships between the use of psychoactive substances and violence.
Limited data from around the world suggests that intoxication may be a significant factor in homicides.
But in violent incidents, alcohol seems to play a bigger role than drugs.
While drug use may lead to crime, in some cases, this link can be partly attributed to a range of intervening factors, such as socio-economic disadvantage, and other types of adversity, such as individual risk, family environment and peer influences.
The connection between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.
If there is a stable criminal structure, large-scale organized criminal activities, including international drug trafficking, can be carried out without violence.
In the short term, the existence and degree of violence is more dependent on changes that destabilize the balance of power between organized crime groups, such as changes in the size of the illegal market, the death or imprisonment of well-known criminals, and law enforcement measures that weaken one group and strengthen another.
Latest trends
Marijuana is the most commonly used substance, and opioids are the most dangerous.
It is estimated that 192 million people used marijuana in 2018, making it the most widely used drug in the world.
By comparison, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.
However, the related risks of opioids are ignored due to the fact that they are less commonly used.
Of the estimated 167,000 deaths related to drug abuse in 2017, 66% were caused by these substances, and 50% of the estimated 21 million years of life lost due to disability or premature death believed to be caused by drug abuse were caused by these substances.
The non-medical use of synthetic opioids has exacerbated the public health crisis
In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, the crisis is aggravated by methadone; in North America, it is fentanyl. These two regions have almost nothing in common in terms of economic, demographic, or general drug use patterns, but they are both struggling to combat the crisis of opioids, which are easy to obtain and have low production costs.
In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has led to a 20-year increase in opioid overdose deaths.
In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths registered in the United States involved fentanyl.
Canada also reported similar results, but with lower numbers.
Part of the reason that fentanyl causes overdose deaths is that fentanyl is unpredictable in the illicit drug market.
In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, the market for non-medical use of khat has grown significantly.
In the region, more and more patients with the disease are receiving treatment with Qumado.
In 2017, the global seizure of fentanyl increased significantly, reaching a peak of more than 125 tons.
However, in 2018, after India passed a new law to regulate ketamine, global seizures fell to 32 tons.
The crises in these two locations were caused by the manufacture of simple and low-cost products, as well as the lack of international regulation of ketamine and many other fentanyl-like substances or their precursors.
What exacerbates the crisis in these two regions is that these substances are available on the pharmaceutical and black markets, making it more difficult to detect and prevent their abuse.
The use of stimulants is increasing.
The field of stimulants is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are on the rise in their primary markets.
About 19 million people used cocaine in 2018, as cocaine is popular in North America and Western Europe.
About 27 million people used amphetamines in the same year, with methamphetamine being the most commonly used amphetamine-type stimulant in Southeast Asia and North America.
According to most indicators available, methamphetamine use has been expanding in both regions for the past 20 years.
In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist, and sometimes even substitute for each other. When the use of one drug increases, the use of the other decreases, and sometimes both increase and decrease simultaneously to meet the needs of the same market.
COVID-19 increases the risk for injecting drug users
It is estimated that there were about 11.3 million people who injected drugs in 2018, and about 10% of global HIV infections were caused by injecting drugs.
More than 1 million injection drug users are infected with HIV, and 5.5 million people have hepatitis C.
In 2017, about 585,000 people died from drug use, half of whom died from liver disease caused by hepatitis C, and most of the injecting drug users with hepatitis C have not been treated.
The shortage of opioids caused by the COVID-19 restrictions may lead users to substitute them with more readily available substances such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or to mix opioids with synthetic drugs.
As some users switch to injecting or injecting more frequently, more harmful use patterns may emerge.

EU summit debates refugee policy; EU officials: reception process is fraught with obstacles - www.chinanews.com
EU summit is in constant disagreement over refugee policy; EU officials: every step in the reception process is a bottleneck
[Reporter of the Global Times stationed in Belgium, Ni Ruifeng] According to a report by Agence France-Presse on February 10, at the latest EU summit on that day, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said that the EU leaders agreed to establish stricter policies on illegal immigration, making it easier to expel illegal immigrants.
The move by the EU is reportedly in response to growing concerns about illegal immigration in Europe, where the core issue now is that the number of illegal immigrants who can ultimately be repatriated is very small.
According to the summit document, EU leaders called on the Commission to "immediately mobilize a large amount of EU funds" to strengthen external borders with infrastructure and surveillance measures.
However, the EU and its member states have been arguing over issues such as the cost of the fence.
Von der Leyen has repeatedly stated that EU funds will not pay for the costs involved.
However, some diplomats from member countries said that if the EU could share the cost of installing cameras, observation towers, and other infrastructure along the external border, this would free up national budgets for each country and speed up the construction process.
According to the European Euractiv website, EU officials admit that every step in the process of accepting refugees is fraught with difficulties. The limited capacity for accepting refugees and the overburdened immigration authorities in member states cannot stop refugees from submitting "countless" asylum applications in various EU countries. The EU's refugee acceptance system is in a state of "permanent crisis."
According to the European Commission, the Schengen countries in the EU received more than 920,000 asylum applications last year, an increase of nearly half compared to the previous year.
At the same time, the EU recorded more than 330,000 illegal entries last year.
In this context, the summit also agreed on a "principle" that EU countries can deport illegal immigrants back to their home countries based on a court ruling of another member country.
In addition, the report states that EU leaders also agreed to "increase the use of the concept of safe countries," which will pave the way for the EU to establish a common list.

The United States' upgrading of the "chip war" deals a heavy blow to the global semiconductor industry - www.chinanews.com
Recently, the United States' "chip war" with China has been escalating - first, the Netherlands and Japan, under pressure from the United States, agreed to launch controls on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China; later, foreign media reported that the United States government is considering cutting off all ties between US suppliers and Huawei, prohibiting US suppliers from providing any products to Huawei; the Biden administration is also preparing to announce an executive order to limit US investment in sensitive Chinese technology industries... Not long after the start of 2023, the United States has been using increasingly bad tactics to curb the development of China's semiconductor-related industries.
In recent years, the United States has never stopped its efforts to suppress China's "chip" development. While it has accurately suppressed the semiconductor supply chain in China, it has also built a "de-China" alliance for the semiconductor industry chain, with the aim of completely "breaking away" from China in the advanced semiconductor industry.
Whether it is to form a "technology alliance" with South Korea or a "semiconductor quadrilateral alliance" with South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, or to establish a "semiconductor industry circle" through the Quad mechanism and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, the United States is attempting to build a closed supply chain cycle dominated by the United States by introducing politicized, partisan, and weaponized means into the semiconductor industry, thereby making up for its shortcomings in the field of semiconductor manufacturing and maintaining its leading position in the global semiconductor industry.
However, the United States' overtly aggressive "chip warfare" against China is also "hurting the enemy while damaging oneself".
Recently, the well-known chip manufacturing equipment supplier, the Panasonic Group, announced that it would lay off 1,300 full-time employees due to the latest round of export bans on Chinese chip manufacturing equipment, and it also plans to lay off 1,400 temporary employees in the next two quarters.
The global leader in lithography, the Dutch ASML Holding Company, recently warned that banning the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to a rise in the price of semiconductors.
According to an analysis by the American media, many American companies have suffered after the US government imposed arbitrary sanctions on the semiconductor and other industries in China. These companies include developers of electronic design automation tools, chip designers, manufacturers of wafer manufacturing equipment, and chip manufacturers themselves.
The United States claims to suppress China's advanced semiconductor industry, but it has dragged down the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain.
The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, and has long formed a closely connected global semiconductor industry chain.
According to estimates by professionals, based on specialized division of labor, the entire production process of semiconductor products needs to cross national borders more than 70 times, and the entire process takes 100 days.
Although the United States has a relatively strong semiconductor industry foundation, it is relatively weak in manufacturing capabilities, especially in advanced process technologies, and is heavily dependent on the East Asian region.
Even if the United States tries to steer the advanced chip supply chain towards the "closed circle" regional development dominated by the United States, the regional distribution and interdependence of the global semiconductor industry will be difficult to change.
The United States has vigorously “rebuilt” the semiconductor industry chain “de-China-ized” it, which has severely damaged the global semiconductor industry.
Chips are the core of the future industry globally, and the development of the chip industry cannot be achieved without the joint participation of all countries around the world.
In recent years, the United States has taken a series of unilateral actions, successively issuing the "Innovation and Competition Act," the "American Competition Act of 2022," and the "Chips and Science Act," using technological hegemony to consolidate its technological superiority; it has used "carrots and sticks" to coerce chip manufacturing companies such as Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, and Samsung to set up factories in the United States, and has made every effort to ensure that the United States maintains its global leadership in the field of chips.
In the short term, the United States has indeed created trouble for China's semiconductor industry and related industries, and has reaped real benefits.
In the long run, however, the United States' excessive pressure will force China's semiconductor industry to continue to break through, causing the United States to lose a huge Chinese market, ultimately greatly weakening the innovation will and ability of American technology companies, and damaging the development of the global semiconductor industry.

First batch of personal pension investment products launched, with a minimum holding period of 360 days - www.chinanews.com
First batch of personal pension financial products launched
7 products are available for home institutions, and the shortest holding period is 360 days.
Personal pension financial products have finally been launched.
On February 10, China Finance Network released the first list of personal pension investment products, and 7 personal pension investment products from Bank of China Wealth Management, Agricultural Bank of China Wealth Management, and China Postal Savings Wealth Management were officially launched.
Up to this point, the "shelves" of personal pension accounts have finally been filled with four types of products: personal pension savings, personal pension investment, personal pension insurance, and publicly-traded personal pension funds.
It was reported that the first batch of personal pension investment products are all publicly traded net asset value open-end products, including 5 newly issued products and 2 existing products. Except for one product that is a mixed type product, the remaining 6 products are all fixed income type products.
As a reporter from Beijing Youth Daily observed, four of the five new products were from Bank of China Wealth Management, all of which were fixed-income products with the shortest holding period of 365 days, 540 days, 720 days, and 1080 days, respectively. The corresponding performance benchmarks (annualized) were 3.70% - 4.20%, 4.10% - 4.60%, 4.40% - 4.90%, and 5.25% - 5.75%.
The remaining new product is "Postal Savings Wealth Add Yi Huangjin Hongjin No. 1 Shortest Holding Period 1095 Days," which is also a fixed-income product. It began collecting funds on February 10 and ended on February 19. Its risk level is level 2.
Of the two surviving products, one is Agricultural Bank of China Wealth Management’s “Agricultural Bank of China Unity·Dynamic” 360-day technology innovation RMB wealth management product, which is of a mixed nature and has a risk level of three.
Another surviving product is "Postal Savings Wealth Add Yi Huangjin Hongjin No. 1 with a minimum holding period of 365 days," of the fixed income type, which began collecting funds on December 30 last year and officially started operating on January 4 this year. Its cumulative net value on February 8 was 1.0011.
According to the "Opinions of the State Council Office on Promoting the Development of Individual Pension Insurance", the funds in the personal pension account can be invested in financial products such as bank wealth management products, savings deposits, commercial pension insurance, and publicly offered funds.
The launch of the first personal pension investment products marks the official start of personal pension investors being able to purchase investment products through their personal pension fund accounts.
In November last year, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission formulated the Provisional Measures for the Management of Individual Pension Business of Commercial Banks and Asset Management Companies.
The Measures stipulate that participants may purchase personal pension products such as personal pension savings, personal pension financial products, personal pension insurance products, and personal pension publicly offered fund products through their personal pension fund accounts.
Subsequently, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the Ministry of Finance, and the State Administration of Taxation issued a notice, clearly stating that the individual pension system would be implemented in 36 pilot cities and regions, including Beijing, Tianjin, and the Xiongan New Area in Hebei, as well as Jincheng in Shanxi.
As of the end of 2022, there were 19.54 million participants in individual pensions, with 6.13 million people paying contributions, with a total of 14.2 billion yuan in contributions.
Previously, banks participating in the pilot only offered three types of products: personal retirement savings, personal retirement insurance products, and publicly traded retirement funds.
Now that personal pension investment products have gathered together, how should investors choose?
According to experts from the product development department of ICBC Wealth Management, compared with other personal pension products, pilot-phase pension wealth management products and personal pension wealth management products both have three characteristics.
One is stability, with a more robust risk management mechanism, more stable investment strategies and principles, and the implementation of independent third-party custody by non-parent banks.
Second, long-term nature. The duration of the pilot period for the long-term care financial products is 5 years or more. In the future, the holding period for individual pension financial products will be a minimum of 1 year, and holding periods of 3 years or more will be encouraged.
Third, it is inclusive. The threshold for purchasing products is low, with a starting point of 1 yuan, and some as low as 0.01 yuan. The custody fees, management fees, and other fees for the products are even more affordable.
Professionals pointed out that investors should choose according to the characteristics of the products and their own risk tolerance.
Individual retirement savings have the characteristics of long-term duration, high interest rates, and high safety, which are suitable for people with low risk tolerance; individual retirement insurance products focus on protection and are more suitable for people who cannot bear investment risks and can accept stable returns; while individual retirement investment products and publicly offered fund products do not guarantee returns, and have certain investment risks, but have higher expected returns, which are suitable for people with certain financial knowledge and high risk tolerance.

The fitness industry should overcome the crisis of trust - www.chinanews.com
Another large gym “defaults”?
Recently, the issue of member rights protection at the well-known fitness institution, Zhongjian Fitness, has attracted social attention.
After the Spring Festival, many members found that their stores were not operating normally. Subsequently, rumors about the closure and disappearance of the agency caused panic among members, leading to the involvement of public security and human resources departments.
Finally, the relevant person in charge of the agency came forward to respond, promising to work hard to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of employees and members, and the storm was finally calmed down.
Some gyms have temporarily closed due to operational problems, and consumers could have waited calmly for the problems to be resolved. Why is the first reaction of many members to this situation “something is wrong”?
The legal battle for the rights of fitness club members is a symptom of a deeper problem of trust in the industry.
Domestically, traditional gyms generally adopt a prepaid model, and “making money from customers who don’t come” is the underlying logic behind their development.
By obtaining cash flow through the pre-sale of membership cards and opening new stores, it seems that the cycle can be repeated, but in reality, it is like eating the rice of the ox, and it is impossible to form a stable profit model.
Negative news about gyms closing down and other industries is being reported frequently, which has a strong impact on consumer confidence.
In terms of market prospects, gyms are certainly a good business with a “promising future”.
Although the fitness industry has its ups and downs, it has always been a focus of capital.
Multiple data show that the popularity of cultural and sports consumption, among other areas, is on the rise, and the market is continuing to recover.
Specifically in the fitness market, as the standard of living of residents steadily improves, the concept of a healthy lifestyle has become deeply ingrained in people’s minds, and the fitness industry has great potential for development.
The better the situation, the more the industry needs to pay attention to the quality of development.
However, some institutions are overly optimistic about the fitness market after the recovery in consumption, and just as they are coming out of the crisis, they are sounding the call to expand and invest all their financing funds in building new stores.
It cannot be denied that in recent years, many institutions have withdrawn due to the impact of the pandemic, and the industry has undergone a reshuffle. At this time, powerful enterprises choose to increase their acquisition efforts selectively and reorganize, which is undoubtedly a new opportunity.
However, in order for the fitness market to develop and enter into a virtuous cycle, and to embark on a prosperous path, the industry must change its traditional model and change its business strategy.
Only by persevering and re-establishing consumer trust and security can we truly win the market and win the future.
Compared to the aggressive market capture of Big Chill, what the fitness industry currently needs is to calm down and optimize its services, and to stabilize users with high-quality development.
First of all, we need to rely on services to retain users.
Gyms belong to the service industry, and their essence is to adhere to the "user orientation", to focus on user needs and to place the focus of their business on improving the quality of their services.
Secondly, digital transformation is the key to improving user experience.
For example, the popular Internet gym model, which allows users to pay per session and choose their own location.
At the same time, the use of body data and movement data can effectively meet social needs and achieve a complete service loop from online to offline.
Without private sales pitches and huge annual fees, users' concerns about gyms "running away" are reduced, and their trust is increased.
In addition, we must actively explore multiple business models.
Nowadays, sports consumption has moved from a single service to a scenario-based consumption. Fitness clubs are expected to become a new entry point for consumption, and peripheral products such as sports supplements and fitness equipment required for exercise may become a new source of profit, providing consumers with more choices.

Buy cheap and return the difference!
“Price Difference Compensation” Reappears in Nanjing Real Estate Market - www.chinanews.com
Report from the Yangtze Evening News (reporter: Ma Zhuopo) - In an interview on the 10th, reporters from Yangtze Evening News/Zhi Niu News discovered that the "guaranteed price agreement" that had not been seen for more than a decade had returned to the Nanjing real estate market. A property in the Jiangbei New Area claimed "difference compensation", where the discount for other properties was greater than the previous discount before the keys were handed over, and the developer was willing to exchange homes with buyers and refund the difference.
The conditions of the "price protection agreement" are not few.
The property, located in Jiangbei New District, is called Poli Yanzi Cuiyun Taiji, and the person looking at the property, Mr. Sun, told the reporter that he found a “statement” during his visit to the property last weekend.
The pictures he sent to the reporter showed that the developer of the property promised that if the buyer purchased the property between February 1 and February 28, the developer would exchange the property and refund the difference in price if the discount for other properties in the project was greater than the discount previously enjoyed by the buyer (limited to other unsold properties that belong to the same floor plan, the same building, the same unit, and the same type of property as the property in question).
Mr. Sun said that the real estate consultant said that this was actually a “price protection agreement” aimed at reassuring buyers that they did not have to worry about the developer lowering the price for promotional purposes. “Now, we are afraid that the price will be lowered after we buy it. We don’t have time to go to the sales office to complain, and if we don’t complain, it is indeed reassuring.”
There are also many home buyers who believe that the “price guarantee agreement” is a way to “reassure” home buyers, but the conditions are not bad.
Ms. Zheng, who intends to buy a house for the first time in Jingbei, said that the properties with a guarantee of price firstly need to be of the same type and in the same building and unit. There are very few properties for buyers to compare, so the “threshold” is quite high.
Some buyers also believe that due to information asymmetry, it is not impossible that additional discounts will be given during the sale, making it difficult for buyers to "stand up for their rights."
Whether or not it will be possible to keep the home buyers will have to be observed.
A reporter searched for the property on the Nanjing online real estate website and found that the project sold 252 units in two buildings in November last year. The unit sizes ranged from 105 square meters to 129 square meters, and the average selling price for fully furnished units was 39,843 yuan/square meter.
However, more than two months have passed, and online real estate shows that the total number of unsold units in the project is currently 157, accounting for 62.3%, of which 80% are in unit 128, with a total of 113 unsold units, and 44 units in unit 124 are also unsold; the total number of transactions in the project is only 33 units, accounting for only 13%.
Market insiders explained that "guaranteed price agreements" had also appeared in Nanjing in 2008.
In August of that year, the Lugantaxi West Yard project on the Huangshan Road in Heqing County launched a "guarantee plan" to attract buyers. The specific content of the plan was "the company solemnly promises that if the discount range of the project is expanded within a year, the company will return the difference to the old owners according to the difference."
After that, in April 2011, nine properties in Nanjing also promised to compensate for the difference in price by offering a portion of their available properties.
“The property market is recovering, and we need a ‘stimulant’ at this time.
"Shen, a senior property developer in Nanjing, said that the 'protection agreement' is also one of the marketing methods of real estate companies.
He believes that developers are in greater need of confidence than home buyers, and the introduction of the "price guarantee agreement" is actually intended to boost their confidence.
As for whether the buyers will stay, he said that it depends on the influence of multiple factors such as the control policies and loan thresholds, and it is still to be observed at present.
Multiple data declines, Taiwan's poor economic performance at the start of the year - www.chinanews.com
Xinhua News Agency Taipei February 11 (Reporters Zhao Bo and Huang Yang) The export trade volume has been “five consecutive months of decline”, the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) has contracted for seven consecutive months, and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has seen “three-digit figures”… Recently, the Taiwan authorities have successively released economic data for January 2023.
Experts analyzed that Taiwan's economy had a poor start to the year, and the growth pressure was not small.
According to the Taiwan authorities' department in charge of financial affairs, Taiwan's exports amounted to US$31.51 billion in January this year, a year-on-year decrease of 21.2%, marking the fifth consecutive month of negative growth.
The export volume of 11 major export commodities all showed a decline compared to the same period last year.
Rubber and plastic products and optical instruments fell the most, with year-on-year declines of 37.6% and 35.7%, respectively.
Exports of electronic components decreased by 20.1% year-on-year, the largest decline in 11 years.
Among them, the annual decline in integrated circuits was 18.3%, the largest drop in 14 years.
According to Cai Meina, head of the statistics department, this indicates that the weak demand effect in the consumer electronics industry is spreading, and the electronics industry is entering a period of adjustment.
Statistics show that in January, imports and exports of Taiwan fell simultaneously, with outbound shipments amounting to only US$2.34 billion, the lowest level in nearly three years.
The Taiwan authorities in charge of financial affairs believe that global end-demand has decreased, and the adjustment of industry inventory has suppressed the willingness of manufacturers to purchase raw materials. The export slump is unlikely to improve in the short term. Taiwan's exports in the first quarter of this year are expected to decline more than expected.
According to the Taiwan China Economic Research Institute, the Taiwan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was 40.4% after seasonal adjustment in January this year, a 3.3 percentage point drop from December last year, and a contraction for seven consecutive months.
In the economic monitoring indicator system, the PMI is set at 50% as the demarcation line between prosperity and contraction, and an index greater than 50% represents expansion of prosperity, and vice versa for contraction.
In January, Taiwan's PMI was composed of five indicators, including new orders, production and labor tightening, supplier delivery time reduction, and inventory tightening.
All six industries returned a PMI contraction, with the order of contraction speed being the electrical and mechanical equipment industry (35.1%), the electronic and optical industry (35.2%), the chemical and biotech medical industry (39.2%), the basic raw material industry (42.4%), the transportation industry (42.6%), and the food and textile industry (45.7%).
In terms of prices, the "Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics" of the Taiwan authorities announced that the CPI annual growth rate of Taiwan in January was 3.04%, which has exceeded 3% since July last year.
Among them, vegetable prices soared by 28.25%, setting a new high in 17 months.
Cai Zhihong, a special commissioner of the Taiwan "Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics," admitted that the increase in vegetable prices was indeed beyond expectations. Excluding the factors of the Chinese New Year, the average CPI in January and February of this year should be close to 2.71% in December last year. Inflation pressure still exists and is still at a high level.
Looking ahead to Taiwan's economy this year, experts are pessimistic, based on reports from domestic media outlets such as United Daily News and Yahoo Finance.
According to analysis by Wu Daijiang, a professor of economics at Taiwan’s “Central University”, the decline in exports may cause problems with cash flow for export manufacturers, and an increase in the risk of debt default.
At the same time, the reduction in orders leads manufacturers to cut labor costs, which affects the labor market and household economics, and in turn, impacts consumer capacity.
According to Qiu Dasheng, a researcher at the Taiwan Economic Research Institute, the inflation situation in Europe and the United States has not improved, and demand continues to shrink. It is estimated that the decline in Taiwanese exports will continue into the first half of the year.
Taiwan's economy is supported by exports, and as exports are affected by the slowdown, the overall economic growth performance will be lower than last year.
“An important engine for global recovery” - www.chinanews.com
“In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese economy has shown great resilience.
Recent market expectations indicate that the international community generally has a positive outlook on China’s future development.
"José Luis, a well-known Chinese affairs expert in Spain and honorary consultant of China Policy Watch, said in an interview with our reporter that China's epidemic prevention and control has entered a new stage, and the vitality of economic and social development will be further unleashed.
Liu said that in the face of various unexpected factors, China has calmly responded with extraordinary economic governance experience and measures, which fully reflects its economic resilience and management level.
While China is firmly committed to expanding its opening up to the outside world, the internal driving force of economic development is continuously strengthening, and state-owned enterprises and private enterprises are developing in tandem.
Every year, the National Two Sessions are held in China, where delegates discuss the country's development plans and hot-button issues related to the people's livelihoods. They broadly gather consensus, unite people's hearts and minds, and pool wisdom, adding strength to China's development.
“Since the reform and opening up, China has achieved long-term high-speed development and has now entered the stage of high-quality development.
The international community is looking forward to China's wisdom and China's solutions, and is looking forward to China's development bringing new opportunities to the world.
"At present, China is making every effort to promote technological innovation and inject new impetus into economic and social development," said Reos. "Investment in funds, talent training, and policy incentives have made China continue to be full of vitality in its new five-year plan."
In the eyes of Liu, economic system reform is a daunting task for any country.
Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, China has made use of the advantages of the market economy while also making use of the superiority of the socialist system, and has taken proactive measures to stabilize the economy.
Around the strategic base of expanding domestic demand, strengthen financial support for the real economy, support the development of private enterprises, small and medium-sized enterprises, and manufacturing industries, adhere to innovative development, promote employment, improve the income and living standards of the Chinese people, and meet the diverse consumption needs of the people at different levels... China will fully, accurately, and comprehensively implement the new development concept, focus on promoting high-quality development, construct a new development pattern, and bring more growth opportunities to the world.
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the proposal for the Belt and Road Initiative.
“The stabilization and recovery of the economy after the epidemic is a common goal of the international community.
China's economic development potential will continue to be unleashed, bringing more benefits to countries around the world and becoming an important engine for global recovery.
"Rios said that he looks forward to the joint construction of the "Belt and Road" cooperation continuing to play its important role in improving the infrastructure level of various countries and strengthening interconnection in various fields, and continuing to unleash greater momentum.

Half or even more cost savings?
Henan Province standardizes and integrates the prices of dental implant medical services - www.chinanews.com
CCTV News: Dental implants are the ideal choice for many toothless patients, but the price of up to ten thousand yuan per tooth has always made many patients hesitate.
Since this year, with the accelerated implementation of the tooth implant collective procurement, the price of tooth implants has been put on the agenda in various places.
Starting from February 10, the price control target for a single conventional implant dental service in Henan Province is 4,300 yuan, and the total cost of a single conventional implant procedure should not exceed 97% of the control target.
Tooth implantation refers to a method of tooth restoration for missing teeth based on the support and fixation of the upper tooth restoration in the lower structure inserted into the bone tissue.
Reporters learned from Zhengzhou University Affiliated Hospital No. 1 that, for example, the price for a single conventional transplant, from the time of planting to the final repair, is around 16,700 yuan.
Patient He Ying: After the new policy, the doctor told me that for a case like mine, it would cost about 8,000 yuan or less than 10,000 yuan, which would save about half.
Based on the existing projects, Henan Province has integrated 15 medical service price items for oral implantation, including “implantation fee (per tooth)”, and has unified the prices of public medical institutions under the provincial government and the medical insurance payment categories, cancelling or adjusting 20 medical service price items, such as dental implantation surgery.
Li Yunjie, head of the Pharmaceutical Price and Tendering Procurement Department of Zhengzhou Medical Insurance Bureau: The main beneficiaries are the four parties: medical insurance, which will have lower expenses; hospitals will have less pressure, and patients will have more treatments; suppliers will have a market; and patients will benefit the most, as the cost of dental implants may be reduced by half or even more.

The Chinese e-commerce industry has emerged with "new variables," and how can merchants achieve "content is king"?
- China News Service
Xinhua News Agency, February 11, 2019 -- The emergence of "new variables" in China's e-commerce industry, how to make "content the king" when selling products?
CNCE Journalist Xia Bin
“We entered the e-commerce market late, but from the very beginning, we realized that content is important if you want to stand out from the millions of stores.
Fangfang, a "post-90s" girl from Guangdong, is now running a store selling health food on the TikTok e-commerce platform, allowing a brick-and-mortar store with more than 30 years of history to "bloom" online.
By imitating the film tone of old Hong Kong movies and pairing it with classic Cantonese songs, opening the TikTok account of @Fangfang1personfood, the exquisite videos are a breath of fresh air.
Recently, at the Douyin e-commerce event "Find Peers·Quality Content Sharing Special Session," Fang Fang, as a representative of quality creators, attended and shared her experiences and insights into her daily creative work.
She said on the spot, “The carefully crafted video has attracted a lot of attention from netizens, many of whom are interested in the ingredients in my family’s dishes and want to cook them with us, which has suddenly opened up a market for us. ”
”
Fangfang used soup video to make more people fall in love with "the taste of Laoguang," and a live broadcast sold up to 300,000 pieces of nourishing ingredients, saving the family's store on the verge of bankruptcy.
“No content, no e-commerce”, as short videos and live e-commerce continue to develop, people’s requirements and standards for e-commerce content are entering a new stage.
In the early days of live-streamed sales, live broadcasts often used low price discounts to attract users, and the price advantage seemed to be the only selling point at the time.
In recent years, there have been phenomenal big Vs such as Liu Yihong and Dongfang Zhenzhu, as well as many non-mainstream influencers and merchants who have emerged in vertical sub-fields. They have improved their long-term business performance by continuously creating high-quality content that matches their brand image.
According to Gao Yaixian, the head of the operation of the KOLs of the TikTok e-commerce, over the past year, 6.27 million creators have monetized their content through TikTok e-commerce, and their content creation volume has increased by 252%, and the total transaction amount has more than doubled.
"Behind these numbers, we can feel a thriving author ecosystem with a strong vitality.
"Gao Yaixian said.
The Communication Innovation and Future Media Experimental Platform of Beijing Normal University previously released the "Electronic Commerce Industry Content Ecosystem Health Index (ECHI) Report," which analyzes the importance of high-quality content, a "new variable" in the current e-commerce industry, from a data perspective. The report assesses the content ecosystem of 27 mainstream e-commerce platforms in China using an index.
According to the ranking of the health index of the e-commerce industry content ecosystem based on the above report, TikTok e-commerce, Kuaishou, Taobao, Pinduoduo, and JD.com ranked in the top five.
The report believes that the content ecology in the e-commerce industry is an integrated concept that integrates e-commerce and content, but not all content can be integrated with e-commerce. Good PGC (professional content production) and UGC (user-generated content) are the high-quality carriers for integration with e-commerce. The higher the value of the content platform, the richer the scenarios for consumption and promotion, the higher the possibility of e-commerce insertion, the stronger the commercial value, and the higher the proportion of e-commerce content production and consumption in the public and private sectors that are gradually integrated.
On the scene, Professor Yi Guoming, a professor at the School of Journalism and Communication of Beijing Normal University and the chairman of the China Media Economics and Management Committee, gave an analysis and interpretation of the Report.
He said that in terms of content value, the e-commerce industry has transitioned from "consumer accessibility" to "consumer quality" and high-quality, professional, and differentiated content is the "hard currency" of the e-commerce industry.
At the same time, content has become the fundamental and driving force behind the new stage of e-commerce development. Knowledge-based payments, professional knowledge, KOL (Key Opinion Leaders) and other PGC content have become standard features in e-commerce live broadcasts.
Looking to the future development of the e-commerce industry, Yu Guoming made two suggestions.
One is to promote the health and quality of the e-commerce content ecosystem from the perspective of improving the content structure, establishing positive content creation and management standards, and achieving a healthy and balanced dynamic index of the e-commerce industry content ecosystem.
Another is from the external ecology, which is to achieve the healthy development of the content e-commerce industry and the value synergy and co-creation of the external environment.
“In the future, the e-commerce industry will need more support in terms of data and artificial intelligence to form a prediction of future development stability; in addition, it will provide more standardized and healthy growth space for merchants, achieve value coordination among enterprises, users, products, and services in the e-commerce industry, and jointly create a healthy content ecosystem.

News from the Beijing Evening News (reporter: Sun Jie) - Last night, the Beijing Stock Exchange issued a statement saying that the Beijing Securities Trading and Securities Lending Trading Business has been approved by the China Securities Regulatory Commission and will officially start on February 13. At that time, securities companies that have obtained the right to conduct securities lending trading at the Beijing Stock Exchange can accept investor orders and submit securities lending trading applications to the Beijing Stock Exchange.
The list of the first 56 securities subject to securities lending was determined based on the calculation reference date of January 31, 2023.
The Beijing Exchange said that the list of securities subject to securities lending and the list of securities that can be used to cover margin will be published on the Beijing Exchange website under the “Information Disclosure-Securities Lending Information” section, making it easier for investors to inquire.

It will enrich the trading system tools with a focus on investor needs and improve the relevant supporting mechanisms, with the aim of becoming a top-tier exchange that serves innovative small and medium-sized enterprises.

“At the opening ceremony of the seminar for new members of the Central Committee, alternate members and provincial and ministerial-level leading cadres on learning and implementing the thoughts of Xi Jinping on socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era and the spirit of the 20th CPC National Congress, General Secretary Xi Jinping scientifically grasped the laws of modernization construction, and profoundly and systematically explained a series of major relationships that need to be handled in practice, providing us with a scientific methodology for vigorously promoting modernization in the Chinese style.
The promotion of Chinese modernization involves various fields, including economy, politics, culture, society, and ecological civilization, and affects the governance of the Party, the country, and the military, as well as domestic and foreign affairs, national defense, and so on. It is necessary to make systematic plans and to be willing to reform and innovate, and to continuously achieve overall progress.
Top-level design requires a profound understanding of the trends of world development, an accurate grasp of the common aspirations of the people, and in-depth exploration of the laws of economic and social development, so that the planned and policies developed reflect the times, grasp the laws, and be creative, and are able to combine the near and the far, connect the top and the bottom, and coordinate the content.
The promotion of Chinese modernization is an exploratory undertaking, and there are many unknown areas that need to be boldly explored in practice, and by means of reform and innovation to drive the development of the undertaking, we must not be too quick to draw swords or wait for rabbits.
Strategic issues are fundamental issues for a political party and a country.
To promote modernization in the Chinese way, we must enhance the forward-looking nature of our strategies, so as to anticipate the future and lead the future; we must enhance the overall nature of our strategies, with a focus on solving major problems that are crucial to the prosperity and development of the Party and the country; and we must enhance the stability of our strategies, so that once they are formed, they can be consistently pursued and achieved.
It is necessary to scientifically grasp the dialectical unity of strategy and tactics, organically combine the principled nature of strategy and the flexibility of tactics, be flexible, adaptable, and make quick decisions in a changing environment, and seize the strategic initiative in adapting to local conditions, taking advantage of opportunities, and following the trend.
The Chinese nation is a nation that upholds integrity and innovation.
It is necessary to handle the relationship between upholding the correctness and innovation, to firmly uphold the essence and source of Chinese modernization, and unwaveringly adhere to the characteristics, essence, and major principles of Chinese modernization, to ensure the correct direction of Chinese modernization; at the same time, innovation should be given a prominent position in the overall development of the country, to meet the requirements of the times, to focus on solving major theoretical and practical problems, to actively adapt to changes and seek changes, and to vigorously promote reform and innovation, to continuously create new impetus and advantages for development, and to fully unleash the creative vitality of the whole society.
Efficiency is an important foundation of fairness, and fairness is a powerful guarantee of efficiency.
As we promote modernization in the Chinese way, we must create higher efficiency than capitalism while also more effectively safeguarding social fairness, and achieve a balance between efficiency and fairness, promote and unify them.
It is necessary to handle the relationship between efficiency and fairness, and continuously achieve development for the people, development relying on the people, and development results shared by the people, so that the fruits of modernization can benefit more and more people in a fair and equitable manner.
To promote modernization in the Chinese way, we need to handle the relationship between vitality and order, so that society is both full of vitality and orderly.
We must coordinate the development and security of the country, implement the overall national security concept, establish a national security system, strengthen our ability to safeguard national security, and resolutely safeguard the security of the state's political power, system, ideology, and key areas.
While paying more attention to security factors in development, we will enhance national security through development, use the results of development to consolidate the foundation of national security, and create a safe environment conducive to economic and social development, continuously stimulate development vitality, and achieve a virtuous interaction between high-quality development and high-level security.
In promoting modernization in the Chinese way, we must both stick to our own path and broaden our horizons, adhere to openness to the outside world, and continuously expand the breadth and depth of modernization in the Chinese way.
We must adhere to independence, self-reliance, and self-strengthening, place the development of the country and the nation at the base of our own strength, and firmly hold the destiny of our country's development and progress in our own hands.
We must continuously expand high-level opening-up to the outside world, participate deeply in the global industrial division of labor and cooperation, make good use of both domestic and international resources, expand the development space of Chinese modernization, and share development opportunities and create a better future in a win-win situation.
By following the path, we can achieve great things.
Let us, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, and under the scientific guidance of the Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics in the New Era, grasp the rules, work hard and be diligent, fully display our enthusiasm, initiative and creativity, and correctly handle a series of major issues, so as to strive forward on the new journey of comprehensively building a socialist modernized country, and continuously open up new horizons in the modernization of China.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese website) Biden’s government will blacklist six Chinese entities suspected of involvement in the spy balloon project on Friday (February 10).
The U.S. Department of Commerce said that these five Chinese companies and one research institution helped modernize the Chinese military, particularly in aerospace projects, including airships and aircraft.
Companies on the blacklist have a hard time obtaining technology exports from the United States.
The list is known as the "entity list," and companies on the list will not be able to purchase technology or goods from American suppliers unless they obtain special export licenses from the U.S. Department of Commerce.
The companies listed on the blacklist are: Beijing Nange Aerospace Science and Technology Co., Ltd., China Electronics Technology Group for the 48th Research Institute, Longgang Remote Sensing Technology Co., Ltd., Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd., Guangzhou Tianhai Xiaohang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd., and Shanxi Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd.
Prior to this, the White House said it was considering taking broader measures to "expose and address" China's larger-scale surveillance activities that threaten U.S. national security.
The balloon incident caused further tension between China and the United States, and US Secretary of State Blinken canceled his visit to China.
On February 4, the United States shot down a balloon. The Chinese government lodged a formal complaint with the US embassy in China, criticizing the United States for seriously undermining and damaging the efforts and process of stabilizing Sino-US relations.
Based on the evidence of the existing debris and information from the procurement platform of the Chinese military, the US government concluded that the manufacturer of the balloon "has a direct relationship with the Chinese People's Liberation Army" and is an approved supplier of the Chinese military.
Miao Ning, a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a press conference on Friday that China had explained the situation and clarified its position on the accidental entry of a Chinese unmanned aerial vehicle into US airspace due to force majeure.
According to the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, she added that the relevant resolutions of the US Congress were purely political manipulation and sensationalism.
China strongly objects to this and is firmly against it.
"Today's action demonstrates the shared commitment we have to identify and stop China's use of spy balloons that have violated the airspace of the United States and more than 40 other countries," said Matthew Axelrod, the assistant secretary for export enforcement at the U.S. Department of Commerce.
”
Reuters reported that an employee of Guangzhou Tianhai Xiang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd. said they were not aware of the sanctions and refused to comment further.
The Chinese Embassy in the United States and have not yet commented on this information.

(Deutsche Welle Chinese website) Several days have passed since the earthquake struck parts of Turkey and Syria, and the hope of finding survivors is fading. However, the rescue of a family of five on Saturday brought great relief to the rescue workers.
According to the Associated Press, in the hard-hit town of Nurday in Gaziantep province, this family of five was trapped under the rubble for more than five days before being successfully rescued.
Rescue workers first pulled out the mother and daughter from the rubble, and then found the father, but he insisted on rescuing his son and another daughter first.
When they were all rescued, the crowd erupted in cheers.
In the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaraş, a 16-year-old boy and a 70-year-old woman were also successfully rescued in the harsh cold weather conditions.
"What day is it today?"
"—The boy trapped under the rubble for 129 hours asked the rescuers who brought him back to the ground.
A man from Kahramanmaraş is holding the cat he just rescued.
The miraculous success of the rescue operation brought a glimmer of hope to the otherwise hopeless search and rescue efforts, but at the same time, the number of fatalities continued to rise.
According to official statistics, the earthquake on Monday has caused more than 20,000 deaths in Turkey, and the death toll in neighboring Syria is estimated to be more than 3,500.
Although experts say that people can survive up to a week after being trapped in the rubble, the hope of finding more survivors is becoming increasingly bleak.
Rescue workers are still using thermal imaging devices to search for signs of life beneath the rubble.
At the same time, the focus of the rescue efforts began to shift towards helping the survivors who were in urgent need of assistance.
UN officials: Disaster in the region "unprecedented in a century"
Martin Griffiths, the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, said at a press conference held in Turkey that the earthquake was the "worst disaster in the region in a century."
He also praised Turkey's response to the disaster as "extraordinary".
He also told a Reuters reporter that he hoped to provide rescue services to areas controlled by the Syrian government and the opposition, but also said that the matter was "not yet clear."
The United Nations has pledged an additional $25 million in relief contributions to the people of the earthquake-stricken areas in Syria.
Earlier this week, the United Nations announced that it would allocate $25 million in aid to Turkey and Syria.

Great Alaska Earthquake (1964)
March 27, 1964 was a Friday, and it was Good Friday.
On this day, the largest earthquake in North American history occurred in Alaska, with a moment magnitude of 9.2.
Until 2006, the Great Alaska Earthquake was still the third largest earthquake in the world in recorded history.
When the earthquake occurred, a fault between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate ruptured near Prince William Sound, near the College Fjord.
In most areas, the earthquake lasted from 3 to 5 minutes.
The seafloor displacement triggered a huge tsunami, with a height of 67 meters.
Because it was a holiday, many schools and businesses were closed.
The major earthquake ultimately claimed the lives of 139 people.
Of these, 9 people died directly from the earthquake, while the other 130 died from the tsunami caused by the earthquake.

A total of 14 countries along the Pacific coast were affected, and the areas most severely affected include Aceh Province in Indonesia, the Krabi and Phuket resort areas in Thailand, Sri Lanka, and the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.
At that time, the holiday season was in full swing, and the affected areas were crowded with tourists and local residents, which led to many tourists enjoying their holidays on the beach and local people working on the coast being swept away by the tsunami, which made many people missing after the earthquake.
It is estimated that the number of fatalities and missing persons is at least 300,000.
The most destructive earthquakes that have occurred globally over the past 60 years

This earthquake was the first to exceed magnitude 9 in Japan since records began.
About 22,000 people died in the disaster, and approximately 400,000 buildings were completely destroyed or collapsed.
The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant suffered a leakage incident due to the effects of the earthquake and tsunami.
This incident was classified as the most serious level 7 on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES).
The Fukushima nuclear accident led to the detection of trace amounts of radioactive substances around the world, including iodine-131 and caesium-137 (half-life of 30 years).
A large number of radioactive isotopes were released into the Pacific as a result of the nuclear accident.
According to the United Nations, at least 870,000 people in disaster-stricken areas of both Syria and Turkey are in urgent need of food.
In Syria alone, as many as 5.3 million people have lost their homes due to earthquakes.
The World Food Programme (WFP) called for $77 million in funding to provide food for the victims of the earthquake who were displaced in Turkey and Syria.
At present, the temperature in the disaster area is as low as minus 10 degrees, and many disaster victims have no place to live.
The Turkish government has distributed a large number of hot meals, tents, and blankets, but these supplies are still difficult to deliver to many people in urgent need of help.
In Syria, which has been mired in a civil war for 12 years, the earthquake has made the plight of the people even worse.
Within four days of the earthquake, the World Food Programme had provided food relief to 115,000 people in Turkey and Syria.
The World Health Organization (WHO) sent 72 tons of medical supplies for trauma treatment and emergency surgery.

Google AI chatbot "gives wrong answers" and its parent company's stock price evaporates by $100 billion.
(Combined report on the 11th)
Google's new artificial intelligence chatbot Bard has made a bad impression with its "incorrect answers" in a promotional video, causing Alphabet, Google's parent company, to fall by 8.9% on Wednesday, dropping below the $100 mark and wiping out $110 billion (about RM47.65 billion) in market value, closing at $94.57 on Friday.
The market is worried that Alphabet is not keeping up with its competitor Microsoft.
According to a report by Reuters, Google released an advertising short film for its AI chatbot Bard on social media earlier. In the film, someone asks Bard, "Can you tell me what are the new discoveries about the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) that I can tell my 9-year-old child? "
"Bard mentioned in his response that the telescope had taken the first photo of an exoplanet in the solar system.
However, according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States, the first photograph of an exoplanet was taken by the Very Large Telescope of the European Southern Observatory in 2004.
Reuters even reported under the title "Alphabet's stock price plunges after Bard's wrong answer."
On the other hand, Google stated that Bard's response "emphasizes the importance of rigorous testing processes," and will combine external feedback with its own internal testing to ensure that Bard's response "meets high standards based on quality, safety, and authenticity."

Developing a health and wellness attraction in the southern waterfront area, which includes the Marina Bay Gardens and the Marina Bay Promenade, is expected to contribute to Singapore's tourism and economy, allowing visitors to spend more time and money in Singapore.
According to Chen Jianguang, director of the Singapore Tourism Board, health and wellness will become an important component of Singapore's tourism products in the coming years.
The COVID-19 pandemic has increased public awareness and demand for physical and mental health.
For this reason, the Tourism Board has been promoting health and wellness programs to the local public and international tourists over the past two years.
In June 2022, the Singapore Tourism Board held the first Health and Wellness Festival, providing the public with more than 130 types of health activities and experiences.
Singapore will continue to provide new travel experiences for tourists.
In addition to the newly opened Singapore Children's Museum, the Avatar World in Sentosa Harbourfront, the new "Explore New Horizons" exhibition at the Art Science Museum, and the new outdoor theater at the Night Safari, the Tourism Board will support the development and updating of projects such as the Flying Penguins Park at the Wildlife World, making Singapore an attractive international travel destination.
According to the plan, Singapore will establish relevant industry standards for the sustainable development of the conference, exhibition and incentive travel industry by 2023, and focus on improving the problems of waste treatment and carbon emissions, further optimizing the tourism environment.
The recovery of the tourism industry in Singapore has accelerated the recovery of the aviation industry.
According to the data, as of December 18, 2022, Changi Airport has seen a strong recovery in passenger traffic, with more than 150,000 passengers per day, about 1 million per week, which is equivalent to about 75% of the pre-pandemic level. The number of airline employees on duty has also recovered to about 90% of the pre-pandemic level.
Data shows that from January to October 2022, Singapore has received 23.6 million visitors, which is equivalent to 42% of the pre-pandemic period, and 170,000 flights have taken off and landed, which is 53% of the pre-pandemic period.
The rapid recovery of the tourism industry has also driven the recovery of the accommodation, transportation, catering and shopping industries.
The Singapore government and tourism industry have high hopes for the Chinese market.
According to Khor Suk Dan, Assistant Director of the International Department of the Singapore Tourism Board, a survey conducted by a Chinese travel platform showed that Singapore's safety index ranked among the top three in the world, which is also one of the reasons why Singapore is so popular with Chinese tourists.
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, about 3.6 million Chinese people traveled to Singapore for vacation each year.
As China relaxes its border policies, it is expected that the number of Chinese tourists will recover to between a third and two-thirds of the number in 2019.
Kok Suet-Dan pointed out that in the future, the Tourism Board will closely monitor the signals released by China regarding its policies on outbound travel in order to respond to changes in tourist demand.
In addition to strengthening partnerships with Chinese online travel platforms and travel agencies such as Ctrip, the Singapore Tourism Board will actively prepare to receive Chinese tourists in response to new trends in outbound travel from China.
Looking ahead to the tourism market in 2023, the Singapore Tourism Board is confident that the tourism industry will recover faster than expected, as long as the global economy does not experience a significant recession that affects public income, and as long as there are no new large-scale fatal outbreaks of epidemics.
Kim Jong-un and his daughter interacted closely, while his wife was ignored nearby.
(Combined report on the 11th) North Korea held a military parade to celebrate the 75th anniversary of its founding on the evening of the 8th. Kim Jong-un’s daughter, Kim Ju-ae, not only attended the ceremony, but also stood on the podium with her father.
The North Korean official media released a video on the 9th, showing Kim Jong-un hugging his father, exchanging affectionate glances and whispers several times, as she gently held her father's face with her hands and even touched his chest. This father-daughter interaction was broadcasted to the whole country.
However, First Lady Liu Xi had to stand aside.
According to reports by the South Korean media such as "Chosun News," in the official photo of Kim Jong-un and his wife Ri Sol-ju attending the banquet with their daughter Kim Ju-ae, not only was Ju-ae sitting in the center position, which is rare, but the next day at the military parade to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of the army, she also stood on the podium with Kim Jong-un.
The North Korean official media, the "Korean Central Television", released a parade video afterwards, exposing more scenes of deep father-daughter love.
Kim Jong-un looked at his daughter several times from the podium, and their smiles never faded. They even whispered to each other in their ears. Kim Jong-un even put his hands on his father's cheeks, and Kim Jong-un responded with a bright smile.
Other official media images also show that the mistress, Kim Jong-un, was constantly touching her father's face while sitting on an indoor sofa; she was also touching Kim Jong-un's chest while walking with her father holding hands.
First Lady Ri Sol Ju could only walk behind or sit on the side, always a few steps away from her husband and daughter.
According to South Korean media, Kim Jong-un has been increasingly exposed in public in the past three months since the first test launch of the Hwasong-17 missile on November 18 last year, and this is the fifth time he has appeared in a formal setting.
The North Korean official media referred to Kim Jong-un as the most beloved son, the most distinguished son, etc., with the highest titles, and also broadcasted footage of Kim Jong-un repeatedly shouting his pledge to die defending his pure bloodline while overlooking the parade from the stands.
These signs have led outsiders to question whether Kim Jong-un has already been predetermined as the heir to the Kim regime. The Washington Post analyzed that "this is Kim Jong-un's signal to push his teenage daughter to the position of successor," but some also believe that such a judgment is premature, and that there are still various possibilities in the case of a son under Kim Jong-un.
Changyang Q&A | How to view the unexpectedly high January US non-farm employment data and future trends - Economic Observer - a professional financial news website
Q: How does Reignwood Investment view the January U.S. non-farm employment data, which greatly exceeded expectations, and the future trend?
A: On February 3, the US Department of Labor released the January 2023 non-farm employment data. The number of new non-farm jobs was 517,000, significantly higher than the market expectation of 189,000; the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, the lowest in nearly 50 years; the hourly wage growth rate was 4.4% year-on-year and 0.3% month-on-month, slightly slowing down.
In terms of the overall data, there are many one-time and technical factors that distort the data, such as the return to work of striking teachers, the revision of the survey statistical scope, and the update of the seasonal factor. In the future, there may be some revisions (refer to the upward revision of non-farm payrolls from 504,000 to 364,000 in January 2022), and non-farm employment may not be as strong as the data shows.
In terms of structure, the impact of layoffs on high-tech enterprises is still significant, but the proportion is relatively low; the newly added employment in high-contact service industries such as leisure hotels, education and health care has rebounded significantly, and the data shows that the labor shortage in the service industry still exists.
In conjunction with the equally strong service sector PMI, the rebound in job vacancies and labor shortages, and strong consumer credit data, we believe that the US service sector has experienced rapid recovery after the extreme weather and holidays.
We believe that the supply and demand tension in the US employment market cannot be improved without a recession.
Currently, the US labor market still has a supply gap of more than 5 million, and the labor participation rate is slow to rise, especially the labor participation rate of 25-54 year olds has already approached the pre-pandemic high point.
In addition, due to the strong savings and consumer credit of American residents, the strong demand for consumption will cause the impact of contraction policies on the employment market to be further delayed.
The continued tight supply and demand in the US job market will be the backdrop of the US economy in 2023.
Coupled with the fact that interest rates are nearing the end of their cycle and inflation expectations are fluctuating, we are not optimistic about the continued decline in wage growth.
Prior to this data release, the US stock, bond and foreign exchange markets were overly optimistic about the Fed's path for interest rate hikes.
As inflation data continued to improve, the Fed maintained a delicate balance between shortening the pace of interest rate hikes and sustaining market inflation expectations, but the market ignored the Fed's hawkish tone and expected not only an earlier end to interest rate hikes but also two rate cuts by the end of the year.
In a situation where the supply and demand of the labor market are tight and the impact of contraction policies is unclear, we believe that the Fed's guidance on interest rate hikes at the end of the year is relatively reasonable, and the adjustment of extreme market expectations and the congestion of trading may cause some harm to the market.
Despite this, the stubbornness of wage growth is difficult to change in the current trend of rapidly declining inflation. With M2 data turning negative year-on-year and various leading indicators of CPI sub-items gradually improving, US CPI data has been turning to a rapidly declining phase since October. The stubbornness of wage growth will only cushion future inflation data, and current market expectations are difficult to refute. The market may enter a new round of competition after the next inflation data is released.
Shengsheng founder Zheng Yonggang passed away due to sudden heart disease. He led the transformation of China's first clothing stock - Economic Observer - a professional financial news website
On February 11, the WeChat public account certified by Suning Holdings Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Suning Holdings") issued an announcement. Suning Enterprises' founder and chairman of the board of directors of Suning Holdings, Zheng Yongqiang, died on February 10, 2023 due to sudden heart disease, and he was 65 years old.
In the 1980s, Zheng Yonggang served as the director of a state-owned cotton spinning factory. After being transferred, in 1989, Zheng Yonggang became the director of Ningbo Yunhua Garment General Factory, the predecessor of Xinke.
In December 2022, at the 20th China Enterprise Leaders Annual Meeting and the 22nd China Enterprise Future Stars Annual Meeting, Zheng Yonggang said in his speech that in the Chinese suit market in the 1990s, the market share of the Suning brand had reached as high as 37%.
Suning Holdings (600884.SH) went public in 1996, becoming the first listed company in China's clothing industry.
Just as the clothing business was booming, Suning Group began to transform, because Zhang Yonggang realized that "once the market is opened up, Chinese brands will naturally form a tiered brand market, and Suning Suit will not be able to remain the sole leader and long-term national suit for Chinese people" .
In 1999, Suning began to research corporate transformation. Zhang Yongqang recalls that year, “When we came to Shanghai, we sought to find out what to transform into, and we specially invited many experts and scholars to hold some Zhuge Liang meetings and Taoyuan seminars.
Finally, we set two major strategic directions.
The first direction is new energy and new materials, and the other is big health with a future. "
After determining the strategic direction, Shenshang began to look for cooperation. At that time, the Anthracite Research Institute of Shenyang Steel was doing a national 863 project, and the research funds were insufficient, so Shenshang and the Anthracite Research Institute of Shenyang Steel signed a cooperation agreement to jointly promote the industrialization of the national 863 project "Intermediate Carbon Microspheres," engage in the research, production, and sales of negative materials, and promote the commercialization of negative materials in China.
In 2001, Shenshan achieved the mass production of intermediary graphite spheres, and began to replace imports with domestic production, becoming the main supplier of intermediary graphite spheres in the country.
This is China’s first lithium-ion battery negative material production enterprise, and it has achieved the domestic production of lithium-ion battery negative materials.
As the application of lithium batteries rapidly spread, SUNPLAST's lithium battery business began to develop gradually. In 2007, the lithium material business was written into SUNPLAST's main business, and the proportion of revenue from the clothing business decreased year by year until 2013, when SUNPLAST's revenue from lithium material business surpassed that of the clothing business.
In February 2021, SunSun Holdings successfully acquired the LG Chem polarizing film business and entered the LCD polarizing film market, and established a polarizing film company, SunGold Optoelectronics. This field has a relatively high technical content, and SunSun's main competitors are all Fortune Global 500 companies, such as Samsung in South Korea, Sumitomo Chemical in Japan, and JDI.
Zheng Yonggang once shared his experience in post-investment management. “Chinese private enterprises acquire some high-tech companies internationally, but the success rate is relatively low. Why do those acquisitions fail?
Because everyone will consider, I spent so much money, I have to send people to manage it, this is a common behavior,” however, Zheng Yonggang is different, on the day of the successful acquisition of Sandsun, Zheng Yonggang announced in front of Sandsun Jingguang Electronics that Sandsun, as a major shareholder of Sandsun, decided to implement a dual-system management, except for Zheng Yonggang serving as the chairman, no one from Sandsun Enterprise will be sent to Sandsun, and the existing distribution system, corporate culture, various management methods, etc. will remain unchanged.
ICC Xintong News released negative data for 2022, showing that the negative of Sunsia exceeded 200,000 tons in 2022, with a 100% increase year-on-year, with a market share of 16%, and the negative material of artificial graphite ranked first in terms of shipments.
In terms of polarizing film business, Yano Research statistics show that the market share of Sunkyung Electronics, a subsidiary of the company, reached 29% in the global market in 2022, and it is expected to reach 32% in 2023, continuing to rank first in the global market.
In the first three quarters of 2022, SunSun’s revenue was 15.841 billion yuan, and its net profit was 2.313 billion yuan. On February 10, SunSun’s stock price was 19.24 yuan/share, and its total market value was 43.6 billion yuan.
On February 9, Sunsun said on the interactive platform that by the end of 2022, the company's graphitized effective production capacity will be about 100,000 tons, and the graphitized production capacity of the Meishan project is still in the process of increasing.
Wand said that at present, Zheng Yonggang is still the chairman and actual controller of Shanshui.
Tianyancha shows that Zeng Yonggang holds a total shareholding percentage of 40.1% in Shanshui Cultivation Holdings Limited.
The general manager of Shenshen is Li Zhixia, born in 1968, who has served as the chairman of Dongguan Shenshen Battery Materials Co., Ltd., Ningbo Shenshen New Materials Technology Co., Ltd., Hunan Shenshen Energy Technology Co., Ltd., and deputy general manager of Ningbo Shenshen Co., Ltd.
Sunsun Holdings said on February 10 on the investor interaction platform that there is no family relationship between senior management of the company and the actual controllers of the company.
"Fund E account" has arrived: the CSRC authorizes the development of the consolidation and inquiry of all funds held by investors - Economic Observer - a professional financial news website
Reporter Chen Mei of Economic Observer: The complicated channels for purchasing funds make it difficult to collect account information?
Always forgetting the "petty cash"?
The problems of the base people will soon be solved.
On February 10, the CSRC announced that the "Fund E Account" APP was available for download and public testing on various mobile application stores.
It was introduced that "Fund E Account" provides a "one-stop" query service for public fund accounts and share information for individual investors, aiming to solve the pain points of the industry, such as forgetting accounts and complicated queries for small and medium-sized investors.
According to Wind data, by the end of 2022, there were a total of 156 public fund management companies in the country, managing fund assets of approximately 26 trillion yuan; there were 167 public fund share registration institutions and 411 public fund sales institutions.
The account systems of each share registration institution are independent of each other, and there is no unified query channel in the industry.
According to industry insiders, at the end of 2021, China's fund investors exceeded 720 million, which means that half of the country's population invested in fund products.
Previously, investors needed to inquire about their purchases through different sales institutions. However, with the "fund E account," they can inquire about all purchases made through all sales channels, and have a clear understanding of their holdings.
What is the “Fund E Account” app?
According to the relevant documents, the "Fund E Account" app is a mobile application developed and built by China Securities for the public fund industry, approved by the China Securities Regulatory Commission. It can provide investors with one-stop query of off-exchange shareholding of all public fund products in the market.
Investors can conveniently and quickly obtain information about their off-exchange shares of publicly offered fund products under various fund managers purchased through various sales channels across the entire market through "Fund E Account", which can comprehensively improve the efficiency of inquiries.
Specifically, the information that investors can query through "Fund E Account" includes: information on fund accounts opened with all public fund managers, transaction accounts opened with public fund sales institutions, and off-exchange shareholdings of products such as publicly offered securities investment funds and collective asset management plans established and managed by securities companies, with no limit on the number of investors.
Liu Yicheng, the person in charge of business at Shanghai Securities Fund Evaluation Research Center, told the reporter from Economic Observer that investors can use the "Fund E Account" app to obtain information on all of their offshore publicly offered funds, helping them to find "forgotten assets," and more importantly, it allows customers to collect comprehensive information on their fund investments across all accounts, helping customers to better manage their investments in a more timely, accurate, and complete manner, and thus better optimize their fund portfolios and plan their financial arrangements.
How do I register and use it?
The reporter noted that the "Fund E account" app is now available in the app stores of Huawei, Apple, Xiaomi, OPPO, and vivo, but the app is still in the public testing phase. To register, you need to fill in an invitation code, which can be obtained by contacting the fund management company that manages the fund you hold.
A customer service representative from a large public fund in Shanghai provided an invitation code with six digits to the reporter of Economic Observer and told the reporter, “During the trial run of the APP, China Clearing provides a certain number of invitation codes to each fund manager, which investors can obtain by calling us, and we will provide them.
After the trial run is over, users will no longer need an invitation code to register.
”
The reporter registered an account and completed a search by downloading and using the relevant documents for "Fund E account" published on the official website of the China Securities Regulatory Commission. The whole process took only a few minutes and was divided into four steps: user registration, real name authentication, bonding of fund accounts, and publicly offered fund search.
After the real name authentication process, click the "Assets" fund binding button. All fund products purchased by the reporter through various fund sales platforms are displayed in the binding option list (can be bound to an account). After binding, you can see the total assets of the funds you have invested in and can start using the query function.
It is worth noting that the “Fund E account” only provides query services for investors and cannot be used for redemption and trading.
The data displayed in the "Fund E account" is generally the date of the user's query (T day) plus three trading days.
For example, on February 10, when you open the "Fund E account," the total assets, fund shares, and corresponding net asset values displayed on the asset page are three trading days before that date, i.e., February 7.

The United States, Japan, and the Philippines have reached a consensus on defense against the CCP
Asia - On February 9, Philippine President Bongbong Marcos visited Japan to meet with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
The two sides reached a consensus on opposing the CCP's infringement on the South China Sea and East China Sea. The leaders of the Philippines and Japan issued a joint statement after the meeting, stating that they would conduct substantive defense exchanges through the signing of a trilateral defense agreement with the United States and oppose the CCP's hegemonic policies.
According to Japanese media, Kishida wants to use this meeting to help Japan and the Philippines establish policies to address the crisis in the Taiwan Strait.
Xiaomakos visited China in early January this year and obtained an agreement worth $20 billion.
However, after that, Sino-Philippine relations not only did not improve, but rather deteriorated.
Earlier this month, the Philippines signed an agreement with the United States to open more bases to the US military to ensure security in the South China Sea.
The new base is 300 kilometers from Taiwan and is the closest location to China.
If a crisis occurs in Taiwan, the US military may launch an operation from its base in the Philippines.
Japanese media believes that now Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, and even the Philippines have formed an axis with the United States to build a "counter-China arc" in the Western Pacific to promote regional cooperation.
When the Vice Chairman of the Kuomintang, Xia Litian, visited China, he conveyed the message from Song Tao that the Green Party is welcome to visit Taiwan under the 92 Consensus.
This time, the Vice Chairman of the Chinese Nationalist Party of Taiwan, Shih Li-yun, met with the Director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the Chinese government, Song Tao, and with the member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China, Wang Huning.
Zhao Chunshan, a senior advisor to the Kuomintang's official institution, the Guoguang Foundation, was interviewed by the Taiwan Central News Agency last night. He gave a positive evaluation of what Song Tao said about Xia Litian, stating that as long as they agree with the "92 Consensus" and oppose Taiwan independence, China welcomes Green Party members to visit the mainland.
The KMT side evaluated it as a new thing.
Xia Liying met with Song Tao earlier in the day, and the news report for that day did not mention this statement.
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party in Taiwan has been clarifying its rejection of the "92 Consensus" for days.
According to Central News Agency today, the delegation led by Kuomintang Vice Chairman Shi Lijian visited China and, during their stay in Beijing, met with Wang Huning, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China, and the new Director of the Taiwan Affairs Office, Song Tao, as well as with Beijing’s Secretary-General, Yin Li.
When Shi Liyun and Song Tao met, they discussed the political basis of the national unification, which is the "92 Consensus" and anti-Taiwan independence. Zhao Chunshan, a senior advisor of the Nationalist Party's National Government Fund, said during the meeting that the Nationalist Party's "92 Consensus" is the original "92 Consensus".
Zhao Chunshan analyzed that this was different from the previous meetings he participated in.
In recent video conferences with scholars on the mainland, as well as in this one, I have not heard any scholars discussing the use of force or the "anti-secession law"; instead, they have talked about the resumption of exchanges and dialogue.
Zhao Chunshan pointed out that the situation between the two sides was tense and dangerous, and the mainland of China hoped to convey its intention to improve relations through the Kuomintang.
Because there is no mutual trust between the CCP and the DPP, the other party still wants to do a good job of working with Taiwanese, and the representative does not want to ruin cross-strait relations.
According to Zhao Chunshan, Wang Huning also gave instructions to Song Tao in person, saying "you must implement the demands made by them [Taiwanese farmers and fishermen]" and if it is not possible to solve the problem comprehensively, then it should be handled on a case-by-case basis.
The report did not mention whether the KMT members mentioned the daily harassment of Taiwan by Chinese military aircraft and warships during their visit to the mainland, the agricultural and fishery problems of the few counties and cities in Taiwan, or whether the Central News Agency reporters asked questions about these issues.
The AFL-CIO is again mobilizing a large protest against the government's retirement reform plan.
On Saturday (February 11), French trade unions launched a nationwide mobilization against the government's draft pension reform, calling on people to take to the streets to express their opinions.
This is the fourth day of action in the social movement against the government's draft reform of the retirement pension system.
The number of people who respond to the call for the rally may affect the next action plan of the labor groups.
This is the fourth time in a month that the eight major French trade unions have jointly launched a nationwide mobilization, and it is the first time that the protests have been scheduled for a Saturday.
Since Saturday is a day off for most French people, they do not need to choose between participating in a demonstration and going on a strike, and the union groups therefore hope that today's gathering will attract more people to participate.
The unions of the public transportation system, subway, and public railway companies did not call for a strike today, and the public transportation system should be able to operate normally, so that citizens can take the bus to the rallying point, and people in areas where schools begin winter vacation can also travel normally.
The trade union group hopes that more than a million people will participate in the rally today, while the police expect a national participation of between 600,000 and 800,000 people, with 90,000 to 120,000 people gathering in the Paris city center.
Since the beginning of the protests against the government's pension reform plan, although polls show that most French people do not support measures to delay the legal retirement age from the current 62 to 64, the number of people who actually take to the streets to participate in the protests has gradually decreased.
The first strike demonstration on January 31 brought together 1.27 million to 2.5 million people across the country.
The number of protesters on Tuesday (February 7) has dwindled to between 757,000 and 2 million people nationwide.
This pension reform plan is currently being discussed in the French National Assembly.
The opposition parties, especially those led by the radical left, submitted countless amendment proposals, which slowed down the review process.
Meanwhile, the debates between the two sides have become increasingly intense and acrimonious.
A member of the radical left-wing party France Insoumise recently posted a picture of himself on social media standing on a balloon with the image of the Minister of Labor, sparking protests from the ruling party.
The Speaker of the National Assembly finally announced that the member of parliament would be banned from parliamentary activities for 15 days as punishment for this behavior.
Although this reform plan has triggered the largest social movement in France in the past 20 years, so far the government has made only minor adjustments to the draft and has not made any major concessions.
The trade union has already prepared to launch another action on Thursday next week, March 16th. On March 7th, when the reform draft is sent to the Senate for discussion, the trade union also plans to organize a demonstration.
China encourages raising the birth rate by donating sperm to universities, with high quality standards
The sperm bank in Yunnan Province, China, issued an announcement on the 9th, inviting those with a college degree or higher or students to donate sperm. Successful donors will receive a subsidy of 4,500 yuan for donating 8 to 12 times.
According to Taiwanese media reports today, the message topped the Weibo trending topics on the day it was posted and prompted many provinces and cities, including Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hubei, Shandong, and Beijing, to follow suit.
According to a report by the Liberty Times, China encourages university students to donate sperm.
Universities across the country require donors, and the highest standards are in Beijing. In addition to academic qualifications, donors must be at least 1.70 meters tall, have good facial features, no noticeable hair loss, and no higher than 600 degrees of myopia.
According to the report, the sperm bank in Yunnan Province stated that donors could receive a full male reproductive health check-up worth 1,000 yuan. "Semen and chromosome testing, which most people have never done before, is particularly important for understanding one's reproductive status," the bank said.
The donor requirements include a height of 165 cm or above, a college degree or higher, no color blindness or weakness, and no genetic or infectious diseases such as hepatitis B.
According to a report citing Chinese Tianmu News, the human sperm bank in Shaanxi Province has posters with the slogan "paid sperm donation, infinite honor" to call on young people to donate sperm, and encourages netizens to forward related messages to "spread love."
The price in Shaanxi is higher than that in Yunnan. Eligible individuals can receive RMB 300 in cash each time, and those who donate sperm a certain number of times can receive a subsidy of RMB 5,000.
Currently, the highest known price is in Beijing, with a maximum subsidy of 5,150 yuan.
The last communist prime minister of East Germany has passed away.
The successor of the East German Communist Party reported in a statement that "last night Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95.
Therefore, our party has lost an important leader.
”
On November 13, 1989, four days after the Berlin Wall, which had separated East Berlin and West Berlin for 28 years, was opened, Modrow said he would help turn East Germany into a democratic country.
At the time, the communist leaders were forced to step down due to protests across East Germany demanding democracy and freedom.
Gorbachev, after taking power in the Soviet Union, demanded changes in the Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe.
In March 1990, Modrow announced the first and only free election in the German Democratic Republic (GDR).
The election results led to him no longer serving as prime minister.
Although Modrow undertook reforms, opponents accused him of trying to delay the political changes and reunification that occurred in October 1990.
He has also been criticized for attempting to reform rather than abolish the secret police.
In 1993, Mordell was found guilty of electoral fraud in the May 1989 municipal elections, but did not go to prison.
Some have claimed that these accusations are politically motivated.
From 1990 to 1994, Modrow continued to serve in the German parliament, and from 1999 to 2004, he served as a member of the European Parliament.
Modero sees himself as a reformer and hopes to change the Communist Party from within.
In 1999, he told Reuters that he did not want the old East Germany to return, but said that the achievements of East Germany should be recognized.
Modrow was born in 1928 in the then German town of Jasenitz (now Jasienica in Poland) and trained as a mechanic.
During World War II, he served as a sergeant in the youth fire brigade and, as the conflict drew to a close, became a member of the Nazi militia, the Volkssturm, which conscripted men aged 16 to 60 to fight in the final battles.
At the age of 17, Modrow was captured by the Soviet army and taken as a prisoner to the Soviet Union, where he took part in anti-fascist courses and became a staunch communist.
In 1949, the year that East Germany was established, he returned to his home country and found a job as a mechanic. He continued his studies in social sciences and economics and earned a doctorate.
Modrow was a member of the Free German Youth movement, which almost all East German young people joined, and rose to become the chairman of the Dresden district party through the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED) between 1973 and 1989.
He also served in the parliament of East Germany for more than 30 years.
In 1990, Modrow became the de facto leader of East Germany and held the highest state office.
Iran marks revolution anniversary, hackers who support protests shocked by president's TV speech
Iran held an official gathering on Saturday to commemorate the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, but anti-government hackers briefly interrupted a televised speech by President Ebrahim Raisi.
The president's live televised speech was interrupted on the internet for about a minute, and a group of anti-Iranian government hackers, whose name is "Edalat Ali (Ali Justice)", appeared on the screen.
There was also a voice shouting "Death to the Islamic Republic."
According to a report by Reuters today, hackers interrupted the coverage of the national television station during the anniversary of the Iranian Revolution.
As Iran's official commemoration of the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution took place, the hardline government in Lacey faced its boldest challenge yet from young protesters demanding their removal, but Lacey still called on "young people who have been deceived" to repent so that they can receive pardon from Iran's highest leaders.
Protests across the country continue in Iran following the death of 22-year-old Amine Mahsa Amini in custody of the country's morality police in September.
Iran's security forces have responded to protests with deadly force, one of the most powerful challenges to the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution overthrew 2,500 years of monarchy.
As part of the commemoration of the anniversary of the revolutionary amnesty, Iranian authorities released on Friday the imprisoned dissident Farhad Meysami and Iranian-French scholar Fariba Adelkhah, who had been on hunger strike in protest.
Earlier, the top leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued an amnesty decree that includes some prisoners arrested during recent anti-government protests.
According to the human rights organization HRANA, as of Friday, 528 protesters had been killed, including 71 minors.
The report also said that 70 government security personnel were killed.
It is believed that up to 19,763 protesters were arrested.
For weeks, Iranian leaders and state media have been calling for a vote at Saturday's gathering to show opposition to the protests and support for the government.
On Friday night, during the anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, official media showed fireworks as part of the government-sponsored celebrations, and people shouted "Allahu Akbar!"
(God is the greatest!)" he said.
However, many people at the rally were heard shouting "Down with the dictator!"
" and the "death of the Islamic Republic" in videos posted on social media.
On Saturday, the government television station broadcast live footage of official rallies in all the states of the country.
In Tehran, as part of the official celebrations, domestic anti-ballistic missiles, drones, anti-submarine cruisers, and other military equipment were showcased.
President Leshy's speeches are often interrupted by the "USA, go to hell" chant - a signature chant at rallies.
The crowd also shouted "Death to Israel."
Reuters said that Adelkhah, who has been in prison since 2019, is one of seven French nationals detained in Iran, which is a factor in the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran in recent months.
She was sentenced to five years in prison in 2020 on charges of national security.
They later placed her under house arrest, but in January she returned to prison.
Adelkhah denied the allegations.
Meszaros was released a week ago after his supporters warned that he was at risk of death due to his hunger strike.
He was arrested in 2018 for protesting against the compulsory wearing of headscarves.
The French Foreign Ministry responded to Adelkhah's release on Friday, calling for her freedom to be restored, "including if she wishes, she should be allowed to return to France.

Did the balloon incident shine a light on America?
Strengthen restrictions on technology exports to China
According to a report by the Wall Street Journal today, the United States is preparing to further tighten its export of technology to China following the balloon incident.
Current and former security officials say the balloon incident highlights the national security threat posed by China and will generate more political support for strengthening U.S. technology protections.
The United States claims that the balloon carried antennas and sensors for intelligence gathering and communication.
According to Martijn Rasser, a former senior official of the US Central Intelligence Agency and current employee of the Washington think tank New America Security Center.
"This is undoubtedly adding fuel to the fire and supports the hard-line view on China."
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday, "We will also consider taking broader action to expose and respond to China's larger scale surveillance activities, which pose a threat to our national security, as well as to our allies and partners.
"US officials said they had informed the governments of more than 30 countries about the balloon incident, and international coordination is crucial to counter the threat from China.
According to Emily Benso, a senior researcher at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in addition to the actions of the Biden administration, the newly established Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party in the U.S. House of Representatives may also put pressure on the United States to take more severe measures to slow down China's development.
She said that members of Congress will feel increasing pressure to take a harder stance, which could force the White House to adopt a more aggressive policy.
The Wall Street Journal states that many people who advocate for stricter export controls are also pushing for the scope of the controls to be expanded to include industries such as artificial intelligence.
The U.S. government has also been developing a foreign investment review plan to examine whether U.S. investments overseas pose potential national security threats from China.
Analysts say the White House may face calls to move more quickly to implement the plan.
Syria-Turkey earthquake relief efforts continue day and night
Since the strong earthquake that hit Turkey and its neighboring Syria, rescue teams from dozens of countries have worked tirelessly day and night in the ruins of thousands of buildings destroyed by the earthquake to rescue survivors buried under rubble.
In the cold, they often call for quiet, as they strain to hear any sign of life from the crumbling pile of concrete.
According to a report by Reuters today, two more women were rescued from the rubble of the earthquake after surviving for several days.
However, the number of deaths caused by the earthquake rose to 24,150.
The death toll in Turkey was 20,665, and in Syria, it exceeded 3,500.
The 7.8-magnitude earthquake that occurred on Monday was followed by several strong aftershocks in Turkey and Syria. It is the seventh deadliest natural disaster of the century, surpassing the earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan in 2011 and coming close to the 31,000 deaths caused by the earthquake in neighboring Iran in 2003.
A similar strong earthquake that occurred in northwestern Turkey in 1999 caused the deaths of more than 17,000 people.
Turkish authorities said Saturday that two women were trapped for 122 hours after the deadliest earthquake in the region in 20 years, and were rescued by emergency workers from the rubble of a collapsed building in Turkey.
Another injured man, 55-year-old Masallah Cicek, was rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building in Diyarbakir, the largest city in southeastern Turkey.
In the cold, rescuers often call for quiet as they strain to hear any signs of life from the rubble of the crumbling concrete.
In Samandag, Turkey, rescuers crouched under concrete slabs, whispering "Inshallah" - "God willing" - as they carefully reached into the rubble to rescue a newborn, just 10 days old.
He opened his eyes wide as the baby, Yagiz Ulas, was wrapped in a blanket and taken to the field hospital.
The video footage shows that the emergency personnel also took away his mother, who was dizzy and pale-faced on the stretcher, but conscious.
Fuat Oktay, the Vice President of Turkey, told reporters overnight that 67 people were rescued from the rubble in the past 24 hours, and a total of 31,000 rescue personnel were deployed in the affected areas.
He said that around 80,000 people were receiving treatment in hospitals, while 1.05 million people were homeless due to the earthquake and were crammed into makeshift shelters.
As many people lack food in the cold winter conditions, the public's doubts about the disaster relief response of the leaders of the two countries are increasing.
According to Syrian official media, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his wife Asma went to a hospital in Aleppo. It is reported that this is the first time he has visited the affected area since the earthquake.
Earlier, the World Food Programme said that due to the complicated rescue work caused by the war situation, its stocks in the northwestern part of Syria controlled by the rebels were about to run out.
On Friday, Erdogan visited Turkey's Adiyaman province, where he admitted that the government's response had not been as fast as expected.
Opponents seized on the issue to attack Erdogan, who is seeking re-election in a May 14 vote that could be postponed by the disaster.
Reuters said that anger over delayed aid and rescue efforts could affect the election.
Even before the earthquake, the vote was seen as the most serious challenge to Erdogan's 20-year rule.
Erdogan called for unity and condemned what he called "negative campaigning for political gain."
The leader of Turkey's main opposition party, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, criticized the government's response.
Critics said, "The earthquake was big, but what is more serious than the earthquake is the lack of coordination, lack of planning, and incompetence.

Vietnam News Agency Hanoi – According to a report by a special correspondent of Vietnam News Agency, during his visit to Brunei Darussalam, on the morning of February 11, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, the Prime Minister of Vietnam, and his wife visited the University of Brunei Darussalam (UBD, also known as “Brunei University”).
The University of Brunei Darussalam is the largest center for higher education and scientific research in Brunei, and is ranked third in the university rankings in the region.
The University of Brunei is one of the symbols of Vietnam-Brunei cooperation in education and training.
In July 2013, the University of Brunei Darussalam officially established a cooperative relationship with Vietnam's FPT University, with English training as the main area of cooperation.
In addition to English, French, German, Japanese and Korean as foreign languages, the University of Brunei Darussalam has also included Vietnamese in its curriculum.
During a visit to the University of Brunei Darussalam, the Prime Minister of Vietnam, Pham Minh Chinh, and his wife exchanged with students in the Vietnamese language class.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh is happy that more and more foreigners are interested in learning Vietnamese, and he is actively contributing to promoting the cultural characteristics and local customs of Vietnam to the world.
The Prime Minister of the government, Phan Văn Giang, expressed his belief and hope that the Vietnamese language teaching team of the University of Brunei Darussalam will become stronger; the students in the Vietnamese language class are becoming more interested in the language, working hard to learn it, and will soon be able to use fluent Vietnamese, and become ambassadors of the friendly and cooperative relationship between Vietnam and Brunei Darussalam.
Taking advantage of this opportunity, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh also communicated with Vietnamese students studying English at the FPT-UBD Global Center in Tien Giang City via video, to learn about their study situation, especially during the pandemic.
According to the Prime Minister of Vietnam, Phan Van Mai, the cooperative relationship between Vietnam's FPT University and the University of Brunei Darussalam, especially the FPT-UBD Global Center, is a vivid symbol of the cooperative relationship between Vietnam and Brunei in education.
At the same time, the students of the center are expected to make greater progress in their studies and make positive contributions to the friendly and cooperative relations between Vietnam and the two countries.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh highly appreciated the achievements of the two countries in educational cooperation during his discussions with the Minister of Education of Brunei and leaders of the University of Brunei, including the cooperation between FPT University and the University of Brunei, and the initiative of the University of Brunei to include Vietnamese language in its teaching curriculum.
Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha hopes that the University of Brunei Darussalam will continue to focus on ensuring the quality of Vietnamese language teaching and further expand the size of the Vietnamese language program.
Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung also highly evaluated the positive results of cooperation between the two countries based on the Memorandum of Understanding on Educational Cooperation signed in April 2014; he recommended that Brunei continue to provide more scholarships and effectively carry out various short-term exchange training programs, such as the Global Discovery Programme and the Discovery Year.
Prime Minister Phan Minh Chinh highly appreciated the establishment of the first branch campus of the University of Brunei Darussalam in Vietnam; believes that the university's development scale in the region and the world is increasingly strong; and further expand cooperation with Vietnamese higher education institutions.
Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha and his wife planted a commemorative tree in the campus of the University of Brunei Darussalam and left a message in the commemorative book.
Prime Minister Prayuth Wongsuwan wished that the University of Brunei Darussalam would continue to develop and contribute more and more to Brunei's education, and that it would develop deeper and broader cooperation with Vietnamese educational and training institutions.

Vietnam News Agency Hanoi – VNA correspondents report that the official visit of Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc and his wife to Singapore and Brunei has been successfully completed, and has achieved comprehensive, practical and specific results.
In the three days of his visit to Singapore and Brunei, Prime Minister Fan Mingcheng participated in more than 30 different activities.
The achievements made have injected new impetus into the promotion of the strategic partnership and comprehensive partnership between Vietnam and Laos, which will continue to develop in a deeper, broader and more effective direction.

What exactly was the “object” that was shot down over Alaska?
Confusing and full of speculation.
The US military used the most advanced stealth fighter jet, the F-22, to shoot down an unidentified object flying in the airspace of Alaska, USA, on Friday (February 10) afternoon.
The location where it was shot down is 10 miles from the coast of Alaska.
This is the second time in less than a week that the US military has shot down an airborne object.
Last Saturday, a Chinese spy balloon was destroyed in the airspace above the coast of South Carolina in the United States, after drifting for several days in the airspace of the United States.
The Pentagon said that the second object, which entered U.S. airspace for the first time on Thursday night, was tracked by the U.S. military as it moved over northeast Alaska at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet), about the size of a small car. It was much smaller than the previous Chinese spy balloon that was shot down.
The Pentagon also believes that there is currently no evidence that the object is maneuverable.
John Coby, the Strategic Communications Coordinator of the National Security Council of the White House, said on Friday that although the specific appearance of the object flying in the high sky was unclear, it "posed a reasonable threat to the safety of civil aviation."
Kobe said that this object was different from the spy balloon found in the United States, as it did not have a "payload" hanging from it.
Kobe said, "We call it a 'thing' because that's the best description we can give it at the moment."
President Biden listened to the advice of the Pentagon before ordering the object to be shot down, and he made the decision "very carefully," Cobie added.
The official description of the object by the United States can be roughly summarized as follows: it is the size of a small car, has no control sticks, no suspension system, and flies at an altitude of about 10,000 meters.
However, this information still does not answer fundamental questions, such as what the object is, which country it belongs to, and what mission it is carrying out.
Currently, many analyses and speculations online suggest that it may be another Chinese balloon.
It may have come from China, just like the spy balloon that invaded US airspace and the Chinese balloon that floated over Latin America, and it may have been performing some sort of mission in a different location.
Some people also linked this "object" in Alaska with "unidentified flying objects" (UFOs).
A report by the American news weekly cites a tweet posted on Friday by Peter Meijer, a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives, saying, "I really hope that this 'unidentified flying object' is a spy balloon and not a legitimate UFO."
"It is surprising that the irony of mixing alien spacecraft with weather balloons is causing an intergalactic conflict," said Mayer.
Mejia tweeted this shortly after Kobe confirmed that the object in Alaska had been shot down.
Newsweek said that it was not just Mejia who suspected that the object was a UFO.
Tennessee Republican Congressman Tim Burchett criticized the government's cover-up of intelligence last month, calling on the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to release a report on "unidentified flying objects."
Amazon's customer service attitude is hard to believe.
I'm guessing that very few people have seen this, but I'll say a few words anyway.
The shirt that we bought at the time was a shirt with a drawstring hood, and the one that was sent to me was a short-sleeved shirt.
After receiving the clothes, I immediately contacted Amazon customer service, and at that time, it was confirmed that the clothes were still in stock. I requested a refund, and the customer service representative said they would solve the problem. Then, I immediately saw that the name of the product had been changed to short sleeves, and it turned out that the link I had bought had been taken down.
Then the customer service representative informed me that I could either keep the goods and receive a certain amount of compensation, or return them.
Is this how Amazon handles things?
It's really hard to believe. The fact that the wrong clothes were sent is not my problem. As a consumer, I want to receive the product I'm entitled to, and I didn't make any exaggerated demands. Amazon changed the name and said it was out of stock.
This is my first long review, and I hope it's not my last.
Sleeves that are incomprehensible to people
It is said to be made of leather, and it is indeed quite hard, but if you look closely, there are many small cracks, making it unclear whether it is genuine leather. Moreover, the sleeves of this coat are truly incomprehensible. The sleeves of a jacket are usually longer than the sleeves of a dress, but usually only by 1-2 cm. This coat is 5 cm longer, and the arms should naturally hang down at the position of the palm of the hand, but the sleeves of this coat cover the fingers.
It's easy to buy clothes, and it's easy to return them.
But when will the money be returned?
The clothes were well made, but because they were too small, I had to return them. However, it has been more than a week since I returned the clothes, and I still haven’t received a refund?
And to have to contact the dishonest FedEx, which is the worst shopping experience since I started buying from Amazon!
However, the store was good and cooperated actively to speed up the delivery and refund, but this Full Peak Express is really making people angry with their work. It took about half a month to refund the money. This partner is just trying to drag Amazon’s feet. They are inefficient and have no sense of service!
More suitable for young people
It's a 99 Second Killer.
The workmanship, color, and feel of the underpants are all good, they are soft/thin enough, and they don't have a gasoline smell.
Unfortunately, the style is slim-fit and is more suitable for younger people.
3XL, flat waist circumference 2 feet 5 inches, maximum stretch size 4 feet, 1.79/80 kilograms, the waist is a bit tight when worn.
It seems like there is no drawstring around my waist, and it is quite difficult to loosen it a bit.
Also, it's uncomfortable to wear something so tight.
It's good, but not very brightly colored.
I just bought it and it has already gone up by more than 200 yuan. What’s going on?
The first time Amazon used the delivery service, the package wasn’t delivered because the delivery person wasn’t at home. Afterwards, the delivery person was contacted twice to arrange a new delivery time, but the delivery person still didn’t deliver the package. Afterwards, the package was simply returned to me, and this dishonest delivery person had no integrity whatsoever. I strongly recommend that you don’t use this delivery service again.
This time, they also returned a hoodie that I had bought, and the price went up by more than 100 yuan.
Amazon should not sell its own products like this
Buy it when it’s on sale, it’s not cheap, but the reviews are very good.
When I received the product, I was stunned. The surface of the product was heavily damaged, with damage in many other places. It was either a substandard product or a used one. See the picture below.
I applied for a refund, and the manufacturer's people said it was due to transportation after seeing the pictures, isn't that just a lie?
How could there be wear and tear inside the goods?
There are only two possibilities: either it is a substandard or old product, or I deliberately damaged the product and then returned it.
Objectively speaking, I have no evidence to prove that I did not damage the goods, but based on my Amazon shopping record, I think that such goods should not be included in Amazon's own products. Customers choose Amazon's own products because they trust them. Customer win, we win. The customer's victory is the manufacturer's victory. I hope everyone will work together to improve this, thank you.
I have been using this product for less than a year and two E2s have appeared. I don’t know how to handle this?
I purchased this product on July 30, 2015, but the right two sets of receivers often showed red E2 in March 2016. This must be a problem with the transmitting module, which is not consistent with the 7-year sustainable work of the transmitting module mentioned on the Amazon website. I can't find any after-sales service on the Amazon website, so I don't know what to do?
It's okay.
The first purchase was bad.
It doesn't feel new.
The labels on the box were torn off, and the labels on the body of the machine were also damaged.
And it always goes blank.
It was better after the change.
The exchange is pretty quick, it's a bit blurry at night, and the field of view isn't very wide, but it's enough for normal home use.
The only downside is that there is no card, I bought it myself, and also, I have bought a phone from Amazon before.
There is a sticker on the packaging to prevent it from being opened, but there wasn't one this time. When I bought the phone, there was a sticker that looked like it could be pasted onto the warranty card, but it wasn't there this time.
I am confused because I don't know if it's because the price has gone down or not.
Waiting for the supplier to respond
The packaging had no label, so I called the supplier and said that the answer was that it was authentic because it had no label. If you doubt it, you can mail the corner or edge pieces to Johnson & Johnson for verification. They also left their license plate number and phone number, and promised to send a text message to notify me to enter my information into Johnson & Johnson's warranty card on their website. But I still haven't received any text message yet?
I received the oil in the morning and changed it in the afternoon.
Second purchase.
Amazon's self-produced products are also very reliable.
The mechanic who changed the oil said that the oil was clear and that it was indeed good oil.
Because it was the second time I purchased it.
So I am still very reassured.
The delivery was fast, and there was no place where the packaging was not up to par. After using this oil, the engine noise was significantly reduced.
It is good value for money, and it is difficult to find synthetic engine oil for less than 200.
Support Star Crown, support winning, and effectively protect your car.
Japan Amazon caused serious harm to the interests of buyers due to customer service issues (shipping a 8cm pill bug as a 8c pill bug) (8c = 14cm, 8cm = 2c)
They admitted their mistake, but kept shifting the blame, and always emphasized that the goods were third-party goods, and could not be controlled by them.
Order number: 503-4265464-1830254.
I originally purchased the page in a size of 7c, 8, and 9c. I thought this was a trap at the time, so I called the Chinese customer service of JD.com and clearly stated that 8 was 8c. However, when the goods arrived in China, I found that there was only 8cm. I think this was a deliberate trap set up to cheat Chinese people (according to Amazon's after-sales service). Now, the page no longer has this option.
Chinese customer service: I’m sorry for causing you losses, we have two options for you:
1. You can return the item, and the buyer will bear all the shipping costs.
2. If you don't want to return the item, we will compensate you with 1,000 yen.
(I calculated the cost of the shoes, which were over 4,000 yen, and converted them to 200 RMB. I chose option 1, and since I didn’t have any shoes, I lost 200 yuan.
Option 2: I have shoes, and I was compensated 2,000 yen in the end. The final loss was 150 RMB. Customer service: We have recorded it, and we will handle it seriously. The next day, they sent me a return email saying that I do not accept the mediation by the Chinese customer service, and that was the end of it.
I said: When the purchase page had confusing options like 7c, 8c, and 9c, the Chinese customer service representative helped me understand that Japanese common codes do not have c, like 140, but did you check other bug pages?
There are both American codes and Japanese codes mixed together.
Furthermore, why did you put the 8cm in between the 7c and 9c sizes, when it is the smallest size, what is the point of putting it there.
Chinese customer service: We provide Chinese services, but we don't know if you want to ship it back to your country, so we won't reimburse your shipping fees.
I don’t understand this logic anymore. I am Japanese, and I still need Chinese customer service. Chinese living in Japan don’t need Chinese customer service. Tourists visiting Japan don’t have the time to make international long-distance calls, so the question arises: who needs to call the Chinese customer service of Amazon Global Shopping? It’s probably people like me who shop on Amazon Japan.
Isn’t the Chinese customer service of Amazon just convenient for those who do overseas shopping?
I was not very satisfied with this purchase.
This is the second time I have purchased Bambi diapers from Amazon. I had previously bought a box when my baby was 2 months old. I chose the diapers made of imported European paper. The first time I bought them, I was quite satisfied. My baby used one diaper all night long, and it really can meet the need of 12 hours without changing a diaper.
However, when I bought L-brand diapers this time, I found that there were two packages in one box, and when I opened them, I found that the paper was quite soft, which was noticeably different from the imported Pampers. After using them on my baby, I found that they were still okay, and there were no signs of leaks or rashes.
However, when the second pack of diapers was used, red rashes immediately appeared on the inside of the baby's thighs, and they have not faded away to this day.
I suspect that the two packets in one box are of different quality.
I won't be buying from them again!
Wish to pay attention to the transport protection of the package
This is the worst packaging and transportation I have ever seen for an online purchase. There are no protective measures at all, no cushioning foam, no buffer material for the package, nothing.
Just a deformed box.
Moreover, the plastic boxes inside were packaged in a cardboard box, which was crushed and deformed.
I hope it is authentic and of good quality, so I won't dare to buy anything from Amazon in the future.
I would rather pay a little more at home, but have some guarantees.
Moreover, the issue of packaging for consumer goods has been commented on in 2016, and it still looks the same now, 19 years later.
This shows that Amazon doesn’t care about service feedback at all, and is far behind domestic companies such as JD and Tmall.
It was beautiful, but a bit disappointing.
I really like the color of the entire cup, which is a bright orange color. Although my family is a boy's family, I still think that the orange color looks great with yellow.
It's smaller than I imagined, but it was meant to be taken out of the house, so it's still acceptable.
I took it home last night and tried it out. After pushing the cap back, the distance between the straw and the cap was too close. Because the straw is positioned vertically, my son always has to hold the bump on the cap while drinking, and he thinks this part could be improved.
It seems that the straw cups of other brands are tilted for a reason, because kids really care about safety and comfort.
Lightweight and high capacity
I like that it is lightweight and has a large opening, but the two separate compartments seem a bit excessive to me, and I'm not sure what to put in them.
After I bought it, I found that there was another one from a different brand that was very similar, for less than 200 yuan.
Fake goods, they are particularly bad.
I was fooled by Amazon selling fake goods.
The customer service said that since I used it, I couldn’t return it, and I didn’t know it was fake.
Because of trust, it is heartbreaking. After all, it is a makeup product. So, go to a physical store and buy it. It is more expensive, but it is worth it.
Because it was a flash sale, I didn't read the comments, and I have already submitted the e-commerce platform to the State Administration for Industry and Commerce. Let's fight for our rights together.
Is it broken?
Fake goods?
In short, a tragedy.
The second patch was chosen because it had fine pores, but when I opened it, it had a strange smell. I thought it was normal because I had never used this product before. When I put it on my face, I couldn’t stand it anymore. It had a strong smell that was indescribable. I coughed immediately after inhaling the scent, and my eyes were also very painful and tears were streaming down my face. I immediately took it off to wash my face.
I didn't believe it, so I bought another one that's the same, but not as strong. I'm applying it now.
It reminded me of the smell of cheap hair dye in a salon.
It's hard to imagine that Amazon's own-brand skincare products will be avoided from now on?
Traitors.
At the time of purchase, the activity page said that when you spend 99 yuan, you will receive a set of “Three-Body Problem” for free. However, the product did not come with this free item. When I called customer service, they asked me to show them the screenshot of the activity at the time of purchase. The problem is that who saves webpage screenshots? You yourself did this activity, and you still need the customer to provide you with evidence. Buyers, please be careful and save evidence in the future.
Using after-feelings
This is the first time I bought something from Amazon, and I have a few feelings about it. First, when I used the product, I felt that it was painless and had no stimulating taste. Overall, it was pretty good. It took about 8 minutes to wipe off, but there was a small amount of sweat and dirt on it. If you don’t look closely, you won’t notice it. Overall, it’s pretty good. As for the future, I will continue to observe and use it to see how it goes.
Anyway, I think this stuff is really good.
The second time I ordered from number 27, I received the goods on the 12th, a total of 15 days, which is half a month. The delivery person from Amazon was also very nice.
Third, don’t believe in Amazon’s Black Friday anymore. Order on Friday and the price will be reduced by nearly 12 yuan after two days. That is, I bought it for more than 170 yuan (including shipping and other fees), and it feels like they are raising the price when they hold an event.
The customer service representative said that the price fluctuates, and after I paid attention for more than 10 days, the price was just like this, and the fluctuation was not very big.
Affordable price, made in Japan, with Chinese labels, with granules, and absolutely refundable!
The paste with grains is refreshing and leaves your teeth feeling smooth. It's better than some second-hand products. They say it's imported, but many of the products don't have Chinese labels, so I don't know where they're sourced from.
From now on, I will never buy second-hand goods again as long as Amazon has them.
Here’s a suggestion: sometimes the order confirmation doesn’t show up on the Amazon app. I hope you can improve the app a bit; it’s getting better and better!
Over the years, Excellent has gotten worse and worse, and there is no quality of service to speak of!
Garbage Excellent does not care about customer needs and has a special delivery time of 19:00-22:00 when placing orders.
Because there is an elderly person in the family who is unable to get out of bed after surgery, the delivery can only be made at night.
The result was that they came straight to the door at 12 noon, without even calling first.
If the delivery time is up to your discretion, why bother to make up a time for customers to choose from?
If your logistics cannot guarantee service, then you should just not become an e-commerce company!
A senior with three wounds on his body had to get out of bed to open the door to receive a delivery, and then had to find some spare change to pay for it!
The order has a contact phone number!
No one even called to explain!
The so-called complaint customer service of Zhuozhi.com is a bunch of outsiders pretending to be there, fobbing off your complaints and giving you a so-called response.
There will be no changes or compensation!
I had previously encountered similar problems with delivery times, but I couldn't put up with it this time; it was too much!
The new book I bought was delivered with the front and back covers reversed. This is obviously a quality issue. So I just sent the book to the customer with my eyes closed?
No one will contact you even if you leave a negative comment.
Over the years, Excellent has gotten worse and worse, and there is no quality of service to speak of!
I will not spend another penny on Excellence.
The picture quality is simply unacceptable.
As a title such as "Ancient Map Collection," the book is really hard to accept in terms of the selection of images, layout, and printing, and some images are even pixelated, making them unrecognizable.
Even if this book is not a professional atlas, even if it is a small illustration, it should not be a disgrace to the Middle Chinese documentary resources left by our ancestors in the catalog!
(And many of the images can be obtained from relevant industry resources in clear original format) - what difference does it make to compile books using these images instead of using images?
I regret this kind of academic spirit.
No comment on the text; the Fang family has their own opinions.
Overall 2 stars.
When I was in grade 10, I only read this book out of boredom, thinking that I wouldn't get addicted to a book like this, after all, the web novels I read in the past were not very attractive to me.
Then... I fell into a hole.
Based on this plot, the entire book is relatively light and easy to read. When Ye Zhu was still in the online game, even when the guilds were fighting against each other, it wasn't heavy because they were often beaten by Ye Shen Dog.
As for the part about the competition, it describes the bittersweet feeling of the passing of time and the alternation of old and new (perhaps because I am a sentimental person).
Reading the entire book took up a lot of my study time in high school, but I just couldn't put it down.
The full-time depiction of characters and emotional lines is amazing, and some characters only appear occasionally but still leave a deep impression on people. For example, the characters Ye Xiu, Huang Shuangtian, and Su Mocha, who are given more attention, have a large number of fans, while characters such as Jiang Bo, Chu Yunxiu, and others who are not in the center of the story are also very popular. In a light novel about e-sports, it is hard to find a character that is extremely disliked, which is the success of full-time in character depiction.
In terms of the romantic plot, the full-time writers don’t have the problem of the harem beauties being either beautiful or corrupt, which is often criticized in web novels. All the characters in the novel have one thing in common: they like the game Honor and most of them want a fair victory.
The subterfuge is small, but there is no grand conspiracy, and everyone seems so simple and adorable.
This may also be why there aren't any particularly unlikable characters in the full-time cast.
The full-time IP is very large, and it is also due to this.
Leaving aside the cultural phenomenon of web literature, Full-Time Job is a good book.
He really does provide some blood and a little bit of inspiration.
In April of this year, I decided to devote myself entirely to animation.
I’ve wanted to buy this book for a long time, but I never had enough money to buy it all at once. Then, when I decided to buy it, I found that the TB version was full of counterfeit products. Recently, a new version has been released, and I really like the cover, but I still plan to buy the old version first. So, I looked for it on Amazon and bought a set at once.
Next, let me briefly explain the situation with the goods.
● The fourth book is not shrink-wrapped, but the book is new.
● The 17th book was sealed but was opened, and the quality of the book felt strange and not hard.
● The 23rd and 17th books are the same, but are harder than the 17th book, but are very old.
● The publishers of a few books seem to be different, for example, the 23rd and 17th seem to be the same publisher, and different from the others.
Overall, I am satisfied; it is a large box with 24 books, which is very satisfying.
The little lion who is sad
When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as Lost City, but there was a lot of text!
I read it three times before I finally read the book to the little kids. It's about a little lion who can shoot guns and loves to eat juice and candy.
When I saw the scene where the lion ate the hunter, I felt a little uncomfortable. Modern city people find it hard to accept such an arrangement where animals eat humans.
In the end, this little lion, which succeeded in human society, lost himself. He was no longer a complete lion or a complete human.
Finally, only the silhouette of the little lion is left, and it is not clear where he went.
It is possible that the image of the little lion will remain in the memory of the grown-up children for many years to come, and will be recalled by chance one day, perhaps touching or inspiring them.
A collection of works with a high value for money
1. I didn't know about TASCHEN before, but I recently bought a lot of their books because they are so powerful, both in terms of their selection of topics and their production.
This work has been released in three versions. The largest version, like the Michelangelo Complete Works, is almost 50 cm long and 34 cm wide; the medium version is about 36 cm long and 23 cm wide; and this version is the smallest, and comes with a book box containing two volumes.
I personally think it is acceptable. Firstly, the price is cheap, and the more than 700 pages are divided into two volumes, which makes it easier to read; secondly, it is different from the complete works of Michelangelo, where the paintings are the main focus. In this edition of Da Vinci's black and white manuscripts, the majority of the pages are dedicated to the paintings. For readers with limited budgets and who are not art majors, this edition is the best value for money for appreciating the paintings and manuscripts.
2. The explanations for the painting section are great, with analysis of composition, drafts, and historical context (such as the Last Supper), but I don't know if it's a printing or book size issue, some of the shadows in the parts of the county are too deep, making it difficult to see the details, which is a bit of a shame.
Compared to Michelangelo's manuscripts, the content of Da Vinci's manuscripts is much richer.
The former is already a genius, and the latter is so broad and high in achievement that it is not enough to describe it as a genius.
If you only looked at the paintings, you could only experience half of Da Vinci. After watching the manuscript, I was completely speechless.
Garbage, whoever buys it will regret it!
I never give a bad review, this is a total waste of money, it's a scam, give me a reason!
1. The time is not right, and suddenly it becomes January 1, and the time is reset.
2. The poor quality straps are not made of silicone, and the straps caused an allergic reaction and bubbles on my wrist.
3. I can't get my phone to connect regularly.
4. The battery life is only five days.
5. Sleep detection is not displayed, and the time is 0.
6. Not waterproof.
7. Other.
Logistics is too slow.
The order was placed on October 16, but it was only delivered on October 21, and the result is a bad review!
The delivery is too bad. I thought it would be slow to buy things on Amazon, but I didn’t expect it to be this slow!
Overall satisfied.
At first, I was worried about the packaging of the camera, but this time it was fine. There was an inflatable bag inside, and the camera was consistent with the three codes. I was also able to register on the official website. The shutter speed was 0, and the rest would have to wait for time to test it.
The delivery speed is also quite fast. Here, I want to complain about the delivery guy. Valuable items are placed in the lobby, and he moves so quickly that I couldn’t inspect the package in front of him. I was truly speechless about this.
The seller thought of the customer before shipping the goods:)
The merchants are quite responsible and they specifically call to ask about the screen size of the camera used, which is really thoughtful for the customers.
The shipping speed is also fast.
The diamond film is also quite suitable and useful to use.
Battery not fully charged.
The machine is indeed good, I was wondering how come it can't be fully charged the first time I charged it, and the charging indicator light has been red the whole time.
Currently, there is no official feedback channel for Amazon, so you can only provide feedback in the product reviews.
1. On March 29, the book was purchased for 31 yuan through pre-ordering, and it was shown that it would be pushed to the device on March 31. At this time, it was not possible to preview the book on the Amazon website (because it had not yet been published);
The book pushed to the device on March 31 was blank, with only a request to wait, while the electronic version of the book was reduced to 18 yuan on Amazon;
I have been trying to delete the blank book that was downloaded on my device and then synchronize it again for the past two days, but I still cannot get the electronic version of "The Nature of Business" with the actual content. However, I can see that the book is available for preview on the Amazon website.
At present, I have a few thoughts.
1. The issue of price is not the most important one. The key is how to replace the blank books on Kindle with books with actual content, rather than always being told to “please wait” when downloading.
2. You won't be able to buy the book again after pre-ordering it, because if you decide to cancel, it will be very complicated to download a book with empty content;
3. I hope Amazon provides a normal channel for feedback on such issues. When there are doubts about the download or use of e-books, there should be a place to provide feedback (such as a work order or online customer service, which can be used as a reference for how Microsoft’s official store does it).
Not really recommended for reading.
I read it a long time ago, and I just happened to see it again. Let me write a few comments based on my memory.
This book is not so much a collection of short stories as it is a collection of fragments of life about love.
The tone of the book is extremely plain, like plain water, and the choice of words and phrases is the epitome of simplicity. The plot is as quiet and plain as a street in the afternoon of a summer day.
Each short story is a reflection of a small period of time in an ordinary life, without a beginning or an end.
They were finally collected together and given the title "When We Talk About Love, What Are We Talking About?"
I think this collection of short stories, and its title, is a kind of performance art. The author wants to express that love is not just the joys and sorrows of life on stage, but also the clichés of urban legends. Love is not just a sticky bond between friends, but also the mundane and unremarkable aspects of life. Love should not be represented by the above, but also the lack of effort in life, the dullness of everyday routines, and the avoidance of reality, as well as the uncertainty of the future.
As you read this book, you may recall the quarrelling couples around you, the dull marriages of people you know, and the unsatisfactory relationships.
This is precisely why I do not recommend reading it. From an aesthetic point of view, the writing and plot of the book are bland and uninteresting, unless you live a life of turmoil or are living in a candy castle. Otherwise, you will feel that it is strange but not strange and boring.
In terms of depth of thought, the daily events do not stand out or expand one's thoughts and vision (this is different from Marquez's Love in the Time of Cholera), and the brief segments do not explore any issues, such as what kind of mistakes led to the failure of love?
What are the reasons for the breakdown of the protagonist's marriage?
So I don't recommend reading this book, whether you read it or not doesn't really matter.
The author's ideas are expressed more through techniques and forms than through the story plot, which is also the reason why the reading experience of this book is not very good.
It is suitable for casual reading and cannot be read in detail.
The book is well-structured, but the content is not very substantial.
It explained what and why many sales theories are, but it was weak in terms of how to do it; it only pointed out the direction but did not provide specific practices.
Additionally, the book feels like it was put together.
The examples include both domestic and foreign ones; both well-known entrepreneurs or salespeople and people who are not well-known.
I don't know if it's a story compiled for the sake of example, but if some cases experienced by the authors were cited, it would be more convincing.
The terms "customer" and "client" are used interchangeably.
The title still refers to the customer, but in the main text it becomes the client.
The e-book also contained spelling errors, missing punctuation marks, and incorrect numbering.
In short, this book is a good choice for those who want to get started with theory, but it is not suitable for those who are already working in sales and want to improve their sales level.
A quick introduction to the guidebook on Internet finance
This book is very shallow, and can be said to be just an introduction course. It can help you quickly understand the overall picture of Internet finance, but if you want to understand it in depth, you still need to dig deeper on your own.
Moreover, the book was written earlier, and the content about the later Alipay and WeChat subsidy war to cultivate user habits has not been mentioned; by now, the share of third-party payments is probably not as small as the proportion mentioned in the book.
Now many people go out to eat and bring their mobile phones with them, and merchants have abandoned UnionPay because of the high bank transaction volume.
However, I am very grateful to the author for writing this introductory book. It is clear that the author has at least several years of financial observation experience and is very familiar with the history of financial development in both China and abroad, which is why the content is so easy to understand.
It’s easy to write something that sounds grand and high-sounding, but the real challenge is to write something that is easy to understand.
I appreciate you, and I want you to know that!
The first factor that determines a person's job satisfaction is not the level of their salary, but whether they are given enough attention and appreciation in their work.
According to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs theory, after the basic survival needs of human beings are met, the most urgent need is the satisfaction of psychological needs - the desire to be understood, affirmed, and appreciated.
Indeed, for Chinese people, most of them are “love you in their hearts but can’t express it”, even if they have love, gratitude and appreciation, they won’t say it out loud.
In this book, the author discusses five languages of appreciation: affirming words, thoughtful gestures, serving actions, sincere gifts, and physical touch.
I think what’s important is not what the five languages of appreciation are, but that you can use them from the bottom of your heart to appreciate and be grateful to the people around you, whether they are family, friends or colleagues.
In fact, the closer the relationship, the more we need to appreciate and be grateful, so that our lives can become more beautiful.
Learning to appreciate people can help companies retain talent to a certain extent and reduce the rate of resignations.
Thank you to the translator for bringing us the wonderful foreign thoughts and world.
Due to differences in cultural backgrounds between East and West, there may be some differences in language, and if given the opportunity, readers will gain more by reading the original version.
Thanks again to the authors, translators, and editors for their hard work!
It is suspected to be a counterfeit product, and Amazon is requested to conduct a strict review.
The quality is terrible, the packaging is flimsy, it has no weight, and it’s even worse than the products sold at roadside stalls; it has no weight and no barcode, and the packaging of ten bags is flimsy; it is not a characteristic of a qualified product; this is the worst shopping experience on Amazon, and I have applied for a refund; it is a quality problem; I recommend that the seller wake up and refuse to sell poor quality products; addition: I also bought a heart-shaped stamp, 23 yuan/10 sheets at the supermarket, and I added a few comparison photos to further verify the poor quality of this product; in order to provide consumers with a clearer reference, avoid economic losses, and further emotional distress, I am sharing this review!
Once again, we hope that Amazon can be meticulous and strict with the source of its products.
The hastily produced products fall short of expectations.
Advantages:
1. Big brands, cheap prices.
Advantage 2: The motor and blade are both guaranteed by PANASONIC, and they are OK to use, but they fall short of my expectations.
Disadvantages:
1. There is no charging indicator light, which is the most basic thing. You have saved on the power indicator light. I guess customers who buy a product for 300 yuan are a waste in the eyes of Panasonic, and they have no respect.
2. Strong odor. Even when charging for just 10 minutes, a strong odor of burning plastic can be detected.
The office was tested for one day, and the entire room smelled like plastic.
Compared to the Philips PHILIPS I used before, which is priced the same, although it has more blades, the Samsung product is really not up to par in terms of quality.
Small packaging
When I received the delivery, I saw that it was the e-commerce version, and I knew that I had been scammed again. It was smaller than the one I bought at the supermarket. It should be size M. The packaging was different from the one in the product description. It must be the new version.
The three stars are blaming themselves for not having seen the specifications of the product clearly. You sold me a version that is not the commercial version, and I have no complaints. What do the three stars mean?
E-commerce is too complicated, so I still go to the supermarket.
It's just purple sauce.
I don't like the taste.
The kid doesn't like the taste of toothpaste, and every time it says it's spicy. Maybe there's a more appropriate word to describe it, but for now, that's the only word in the kid's vocabulary.
I bought it when I was organizing the event, and it was very cheap, so I feel bad giving it a bad review; it's a four-star product, but I won't be buying it again.
It's genuine and well packaged.
The packaging is complete, and an inflatable bag is added inside. There are no online reviews, and the product looks like a single product.
The plastic film on the outside of the bottle is just like the one described in the picture, and the delivery was very fast, arriving the next day.
It is genuine, but it is out of stock and I don’t know when it will be back in stock.
A terrible shopping experience
I placed an order on Black Friday, but it took a long time to receive the package, and after checking, I found out that the package had already been signed for. I asked my colleagues, and they all said that they didn’t help sign for it. I immediately contacted the courier company, but they said that I had to contact the sender to initiate an inquiry. I contacted Amazon customer service, and I had to wait for more than ten days. Finally, I found out that the package was mistakenly delivered to someone else, and it took several rounds of communication before I finally got the package back. The outer package was already opened, and the product was still intact, but I don’t know if it had been used before or not. Anyway, it was a pretty bad experience.
Wrong caption
I thought I would receive headphones like the ones in picture 1, but I received ones like the ones in picture 2. It’s okay that the pictures don’t match, but what does it mean that the left and right sides of the headphones have different volume levels?
Although the names are the same, we still hope that everyone can pay attention and, in addition, we would like to thank the Amazon representative for promptly replacing the correct image.
The operating system is generally fine.
It took a while, but overall the picture is still good, and I didn’t feel any difference. However, this system is confusing, and the boot time is noticeably slow. It’s also impossible to make good settings, and the software that comes with it doesn’t need any commentary. The response speed is just average, and it’s not even on the same level as my colleague’s.
I read that the design is very human-friendly, but I couldn’t find any evidence of this. The location of the remote control’s commonly used up, down, left, and right buttons, as well as the return button, is simply not commendable.
So, you can use it as a TV, and add a TV box, for example.
The price cut is too severe.
The price drop is too drastic, from over 100 to just 99!
Amazon had a lot of unrated orders, so I used a copied message as the review content.
If I use this sentence to evaluate it, it means that this product is at least 85 points or higher.
On the other hand, I would never be lazy enough to copy and paste reviews of poor products. This way, other consumers can use them as a reference when making purchases, and the seller can improve the quality of their products as a result.
Cheap and good wires, that's enough if it doesn't overheat!
This is such a cheap cable, but it should meet the HDMI certification standards. I compared it with the crap products from Akihabara in China (the prices are twice as much), and the cable is thick and soft, and the 7-meter transmission has no noise. From now on, I will trust Besee for cheap cables!
The products are fine, but Amazon's after-sales service is really much worse than other websites.
After placing the order, I realized that I made a mistake, but I couldn’t cancel the order. The webpage for contacting online customer service always shows an error link, and I couldn’t get in touch.
After the delivery person called me, I said I didn't want it anymore, and I couldn't cancel the order, so the delivery person took it back, and said to sign for it first, and then I could apply for a refund.
When I applied for a refund, I was informed that food items cannot be returned once they are signed for, and I couldn't call Amazon customer service because they said the same thing - that food items cannot be returned once they are signed for.
I have bought items that cannot be returned due to policy at both JD and Sunning, including milk and diapers, and I contacted customer service and they refunded me. Moreover, the diapers from JD smelled too much when opened, but I still contacted customer service and they refunded me. But this is not possible with Amazon.
The rules are dead, people are alive. How should we contact your customer service department?
Tell me whether I should pick it up myself or have the delivery person buy it for me; it's not easy for the delivery person to do this, so why should I make them spend money to buy something that I didn't purchase myself?
Okay, I won't back out either. I'll take it myself, but I have to give your service a 1.
I advise you not to waste your money.
First, I was full of anticipation when I bought it, thinking that the Dali brand would not be bad at all, and after receiving it, I thought it looked good, the size was not bad, but there was basically one box that was completely soft, and it was not visible from the outside, you had to touch it to feel it, and when you put it in your mouth, there was no taste at all, it was tasteless and bland, and when you bit into it, the flesh was a dark yellow color, which meant it was bad, and it was sold as good and bad, and only about one-third of it was edible, I advise you not to buy it, it is not cheap, and the quality is too bad!
After this experience, I will never buy fruit from an e-commerce platform again!
Where is the anti-counterfeiting mark on the product?
The corner of the bottle is deeply indented, which must have been caused by a strong impact. Judging from the outer packaging, the degree of damage is heartbreaking. After all, the packaging is too simple for food products, and it is also an international purchase. There is no obvious anti-counterfeiting mark, and it is very easy to open the bottle. The most important thing is that the honey inside the lid comes out directly from the bottle. There is almost no adhesion, is this the case with foreign products?
As someone born in China, I am a bit confused.
It must be the real thing, right?
There was also a message saying that it would arrive on the 21st, but I received it on the 14th. This is my first time shopping overseas here, so I just wrote down my doubts. Maybe this is all normal?
The delivery service needs improvement.
I bought a total of 5 vouchers, and when I went to withdraw them, I first made an appointment to withdraw 3 of them, but only 2 were sent to me. After communicating with multiple parties, I confirmed that they were lost and promised to send them again; for the second appointment, I just happened to be on a day off, and neither the website nor WeChat indicated that I needed to make an appointment on a weekday, which caused unnecessary panic. I suggest that they improve this in the future.
Great shopping.
The food is good!
I still trust Amazon’s self-produced products more, and now it’s very convenient to shop overseas. The delivery time from abroad is only a few days longer than that of domestic delivery. I have to say that Amazon’s ability to clear customs for overseas purchases is very strong, and it’s much faster than going through transit. That’s why I buy many things overseas now.
I hope that the quality and price of domestic goods can be better. Many things are made in China, but it is cheaper to buy them back after going out and buying them elsewhere. I hope that this can be improved.
Garbage
When you see a package like this, do you think it looks like garbage on the side of the road?
A plastic packaging that is easily broken is sent from so-called Germany in a plastic bag. Is this kind of packaging responsible?
I think that packaging like this is just like packaging for garbage. When I bought this product, the packaging was extremely simple and there were no measures to prevent damage. It was just a simple plastic bag packaging. When I received it, the package was completely deformed, and the items inside were also damaged.
If I had just encountered one like this, I would have bought a few of them, but I contacted Amazon customer service, and they said I could return them, but I would have to pay for the shipping, and then the shipping would be returned to me in the form of a gift card.
I asked if I could pay for the shipping fee with cash and receive a gift card in return, which would be straightforward if I just bought your gift card myself. I also had to ship the product to a warehouse in Germany myself, which is like buying a product and being punished for it!
I kept telling customer service that it was their responsibility for the problem, but they didn’t even say it was their responsibility, let alone take responsibility for it. What kind of after-sales service is this? One word: screwed! But I guess Amazon won’t give me the chance to publish this review, and will just delete it directly!
Quality is good, 5 stars, but the logistics is bad.
1. The quality is good, it's a bargain, the price is reasonable, and it's worth the money.
2. It is solid, has sufficient material, the welding points are firm, the surface treatment is appropriate, and the color is good.
3. Logistics is a hardship, the order for number 3 arrived on the 11th.
4, If Amazon had not marked the estimated delivery date as February 7, I might have been satisfied.
5. However, if the expected delivery time is marked, it is equivalent to a promise to the user, and when the promise cannot be fulfilled, the user will be very upset.
6. If you are not sure that you can keep your promise, do not make a promise.
7, in fact, I care a lot about the commitments made by merchants.
8. That's why I got a low score.
The gold wire will turn black.
The effect is there, but whether it is noticeable or not depends on the individual, or the psychological effect.
One thing that's not so good is the gold wire. Originally, it looked good in the design, but in reality, the gold wire will lose its color and, if you touch it a few times, your hands and the car will have some gold dust on them.
I hope the product can be improved.
This square one doesn't have any decorative effect, so don't put gold wire on it; it's a hassle to drop it on the car and make it dirty.
The items are in good condition, the speed is good, and they are packaged in two different packages.
The delivery took only 8 days, but it was split into two packages. The packaging was different, and it was obvious that one was better protected than the other. It was wrapped in thick cardboard and sealed with plastic, and the outer packaging was easy to remove. It looked like a domestic delivery box, and a few airbags were enough to make it safe. It felt a bit superficial.
Yarran mattresses are really good.
The 34 cm thick mattress is not an ordinary one, and you don’t have to sleep on the mattress directly.
The quality is good, both the front and back are soft, and sleeping on it is very comfortable, I fell asleep very quickly.
After receiving the mattress, I found that there were two stains due to violent transportation by the courier. Yarran customer service was responsible and efficient in resolving the problem.
Not self-produced goods, Amazon is shameless.
The page clearly indicates self-sale, but in fact, it is delivered by the supplier, and after-sales service is provided by the supplier, and if there is a problem, you should contact the supplier yourself.
If you want to cancel the order, sorry, the order information has been transmitted to the supplier and cannot be canceled; if you want to return or exchange the goods, you have successfully applied for a return or exchange on Amazon, sorry, no one can help you, and you need to contact the supplier yourself to return the goods.
This is a self-produced product of Nima.
The product is not delivered by Amazon, and Amazon does not bear any responsibility for after-sales service. The customer service even said, “I will contact the supplier for you,” and claimed that it was self-owned, which is too shameless. It is blatant and insulting, and it is blatantly deceiving consumers!
The experience of being sad
The filter cartridges I bought from other online stores worked well, and even after 28 days, I didn't see any limescale after using them for a few more days.
Since the quality of the items I purchased on Amazon has always been good, this time I thought I would buy them here. This was the first time I bought a filter on Amazon, and I didn’t feel good about it. Not only did it start to develop water stains early on, but the filter also had suspended black carbon powder by the 28th day. I didn’t know whether to continue using it or just throw it away. It was very frustrating.
Not as good as you might imagine.
Compared to the cables I have used before, the external workmanship is average, and I hope that the internal workmanship is good without being opened, but I hope that it is as described by the store owner. In terms of convenience of use, whether each independent unit is powered is lacking in display
The packaging was damaged, so I waited for a while to test the quality of the product.
The outer packaging is severely damaged, but the packaging box inside seems to be new. However, the manual does not seem to be new, and the renovation was done in September. The products are being stored, and I hope they will not be bad. Please explain to me why several customers have mentioned that the packaging is damaged, but you are still able to sell them. Thank you!
Overall good, but a few minor issues
When I bought a water filter for the first time, I read several reviews and felt that LAICA was a good value, so I chose it. When I received the product and installed the filter according to the instructions, I tried it out and found that it was generally good, but when I poured water, the original water seemed to mix with the filtered water from the spout (the water tank seal was not very tight).
When using it, you must wait for all the water to filter out before pouring it out!
The image is incomplete.
The picture did not capture the details of the side, and the details of the side did not match the style of the main body, with a big difference; this is one; this bead is made in Thailand, but it does not indicate the place of origin; it does not indicate the material; this is three; when I bought it in the UK, each item had its own box, but here there is only a simple plastic bag, and there is no product mark on the bead, so I don’t know how to judge whether it is real or fake.
Be careful when buying, especially if you are buying something from Hong Kong.
Amazon customer service is terrible.
I placed an order two days ago and found that the price had dropped by 40 yuan when I received it today. I spent a long time trying to find customer service, and the customer service said that they couldn’t refund the difference and that I could reorder and return the item.
This kind of customer experience and service is really a million times worse than that of Taobao.
It's okay, it's worth trying for beginners.
It looks good and is not inferior to the top-grade diamond. I have seen the price in the mall before, and it is several hundred yuan. This is the first time I have played with a diamond, and it is okay.
It's good stuff.
The items are really good. For my girlfriend, I was a bit unhappy when I found out that the courier in Canada was not delivering during lunchtime. The courier company simply stored the package in the parcel locker and did not send me a confirmation message to pick it up. I had to go twice.
However, the baby is really good.
Worth buying
The little monkey is cute, and Amazon has a lot of discounts. Zhou Sheng Sheng’s official website ships directly, and I placed an order last night and received it this afternoon, which is really fast.
The postal and delivery workers are also responsible.
Bravo!
A confession from a customer
1 When you receive such substandard products, Amazon customer service tells you not to worry, we will contact you within 54 hours.
2 Then in the middle, you contact the customer service representative, who will tell you that this issue will be handled by a specialist, who will inform you of the outcome.
You can never get in touch with this commissioner, you don't know her work number, and there is no direct contact number, so even if you can't get in touch with her, it's only she who can contact you.
Tragically, after waiting nearly three days, the commissioner contacted me and my phone was off, so I didn't receive the commissioner's call.
I waited for two hours for the specialist’s call, during which time I contacted Amazon customer service and emailed them to ask them to call me back.
It has been nearly three days, and I still don't know what Amazon will do about the coffee machine that I received as a substandard product!
The products on Amazon in the US are fine, and this kind of shopping method is good for overseas purchases, but the service provided by Meiya is far inferior.
For me, I can only continue to wait...
The bottom is uneven.
Because the review said it was good, and everyone was looking forward to this pot, and when I got it, I really liked it, it was lightweight, but when I started using it, I found a problem, the bottom of the pot was not flat, it was raised in the middle and sunken around the edges, the oil ran to the edges, and I specifically bought this pot to make a large piece of fatty meat to fry, but the oil couldn't cover the central area, so I was disappointed, I couldn't even use it, and I guess this structure can't be used to cook food normally.
I don't know if I was just unlucky, but I just got a pot with a bottom that was not flat. Fortunately, Amazon provides a one-month return policy, so I decided to return it.
I cleaned the pot and put it away, and I wasted half a day.
Good product design requires matching manufacturing processes to achieve it.
This is a product with a very simple design style.
The shape of the cube is designed with a slight arch on the top.
The lines should have been very fluid.
Unfortunately, the final result was not achieved.
Because there are two parts at the top, the front is the control panel and the back is the water tank cover.
The curvature of the top cover and the control panel were not consistent, resulting in a height difference of up to 2 mm after assembly.
Although it looks like a very small gap.
But it can be said to have destroyed the entire design.
I feel a bit sorry for the product designer.
It seems that Midea’s product managers are not capable of creating products of this caliber.
(Of course, I can’t expect too much from the after-sales lady, but when I heard her say that all the individual products were like this, and it wasn’t just the one I bought that had a problem, her incredulity and reluctance to accept responsibility made me realize that I can’t expect too much from beauty products either) 2019-7-7 The pump is malfunctioning and the water flow is low. It has been repaired twice, and it broke again two weeks after the first repair.
It’s a good deal after the discount, but the fake discount from Amazon is heartbreaking.
It is very insulated and can be purchased one week after the baby is born.
You can't feel any heat on the outside of the teapot, which means it won't burn you and can effectively prevent the temperature from escaping.
The air conditioning in the room still maintained a high temperature even after one night.
Amazon said that the anniversary event had 320 great deals, but later found out that everyone had them for $249, $289, and $299. It felt like we were being cheated, but after comparing prices at the supermarket, we found that the prices were still cheaper than those of various other brands. From now on, we can bring them with us when we go out.
Vitamix 6300
I had been waiting for a long time, and when I saw that Meituan 6300 was on sale, and that Caiyao Overseas Purchase was the same price, I quickly made a purchase.
I placed an order on September 2 and it was expected to arrive on September 21. However, it arrived on September 12, which is about 10 days earlier, so it’s really fast!
The packaging is small, and it comes directly from the original packaging of Vitamix. Amazon doesn’t mind if it gets damaged during shipping across the ocean!
The machine looks new and comes with all the necessary accessories. The only problem is that the cup shakes on the base when you move it, and I’m afraid that the cup will fly out when I turn it on!
I asked a friend who has 5200, and it seems like it's not as easy as I thought.
The accompanying recipes are all in English, which is quite tiring to read, and I couldn't find a Chinese version online, which is a pain!
After receiving the goods, I immediately bought an inverter. It should arrive in 3 days, so I’ll have some fun with it then!
It’s too small, there’s no umbrella cover, and the material is average.
It's not even a large size!
The second Totes: 1. This one doesn’t have a cover 2. The material of the handle is average 3. It says “Large”, but it’s actually a compact umbrella for one person, and I doubt it would be enough for two people.
On the other hand, the one I bought from Meiya can be used by three people without any pressure.
I don't feel very well.
First of all, the box is not very sturdy and deforms when you press on it; secondly, the design on the back does not prevent the ABS scratches on the box from appearing when it is laid flat; thirdly, the box is just a piece of cloth wrapped around a hanger, and so on... There are all sorts of things that are unsatisfactory, and finally, the strap is a bit awkward to use.
PS: The wheels do feel pretty good.
It is also possible.
Pros: This double-shoulder bag is quite elegant and looks durable.
Cons: The QR code on the card cannot be scanned (what's going on?), the 15.6-inch laptop cannot be put in (is it possible to make it a little longer?), and the double shoulder bag has a locking mechanism, but no lock is provided for the buyer. This cannot be called service with a capital S.
Overall, it's okay, I don't know if it's genuine leather
The overall feeling is okay, but I don't know if it's genuine leather, so I can't make a judgment.
It can hold A4-sized documents, and has held 80-page thick, box-shaped objects (not deformable), but it probably won't hold anything too thick or hard.
The package is soft, and the inner bag is divided in a more humanized way, which is pretty good.
It's just that there's a small pebble in the bottom of the one I got, so I don't know if it's because my character is not good or what.
I was too lazy to go back and forth to exchange the goods, so I put up with it.
Overall, it is worth four stars.
ForRoyal is popular worldwide, camera straps, SLR straps
This strap is designed to be scientific, worn on both shoulders, practical, and the camera is fixed and protected in front with soft material, unlike other quick-shooters that use screws to fix the bottom of the camera and make it difficult to take the camera off.
Garbage after-sales service
I bought a guitar a month and a half ago, and it’s missing a part. After notifying Amazon, they gave me a customer service phone number. After multiple communications, the part still hasn’t arrived. What kind of efficiency is this!
It is estimated that after-sales service will be more troublesome if there is a problem, so I hope that those who are good at after-sales service will take a detour; it is too troublesome!
It has minor flaws, but the sound is good.
The soundboard has a defect, it lacks a corner, and it feels like a substandard product, and there are no gifts, but at this price it is already good, and the sound of the guitar is also good.
Okay, first menu.
It's been used for a long time, and it's generally good except for the fact that the bass can't come out.
The workmanship is not as perfect as I imagined.
The first time I bought it, the product had problems, all the lights were flashing and it was not usable.
I asked for a replacement, but it has been three days since the goods arrived in Shanghai and they still haven’t been delivered.
I also called the delivery person, but they didn't answer.
The courier company said that they only had that contact information.
Amazon can't find where to complain.
I did not ask for this, and for no apparent reason, they delayed the delivery of my order as per my request - this is the message I received.
Then it goes on to talk about transit issues.
In any case, the poor shopping experience has made me start to doubt the effectiveness of Amazon's logistics and control systems.
It is estimated that it will not arrive today either.
The adhesive is too weak and it is not waterproof.
Although the Bluetooth connection is convenient, the printed content is not waterproof and the surface is not coated; the labels are also of poor adhesive strength and are not suitable for cable labels at all; they are very easy to fall off, so friends who buy them to organize cables need to pay attention to this.
The pen is fine, but the packaging is too simple - just a cardboard box with no protective measures. Moreover, the box that holds the pen is glued with a large piece of transparent tape, and the tape is still on the box after being torn off.
Treating a 600 yuan item like this, it was a disappointing shopping experience.
However, the pen is not a problem.
I hope that the packaging can be improved in the future!
In terms of quality, if we talk about writing, 925-25 is better.
First, let me praise the excellent service of TNT, air freight, super fast, and with great service attitude!
I have been using the 925-25 and it is great. I just received the 925-85 and the quality is excellent. The design is also very beautiful. I gave it four stars because the pen is a bit heavy and not suitable for fast writing. The pen cap shakes a bit when adjusting the length of the lead, but in my opinion, the 925-25 is more comfortable to use.
Therefore, they became Amazon loyalists.
I bought it at a super discounted price, but my child doesn’t like the pen.
It was already opened, but I tried to apply for a refund, and they even came to my house to pick it up for free.
This is amazing.
We do not encourage returns, but this is a service that is unique to us in China.
I hope it is not abused.
After that, I bought all my books here.
The headphones have a distortion and noise
These headphones are really bad. I don't know if it's my ears or if these headphones are just not as good as they used to be.
I bought a blue one two years ago on JD.com. The sound quality is good, there is no noise and the bass is good. I have used it for more than two years and it has broken down. I plan to buy another one (urbeats) because it feels good.
I also looked at one that was purple and looked nice, but when I opened it today, I felt that something was off; it was both loud and quiet at the same time.
At first, I thought it was because of the sound effects of the song, but after listening for half a day, I realized that the problem was serious. Not only was the sound distorted, but the bass sound was not as good as before, and there were some noise; is it just my purple one that has this problem, or is the current manufacturing process of headphones really not good?
A pretty poor review, I'm disappointed.
I definitely need to return it tomorrow.
PS looks good
This AV amplifier is complicated to set up, has rough workmanship, and generates a lot of heat.
I will have to wait a while before I can review it!
On August 14, I just got my hands on a German version of the DN1080. It looks poorly made.
1. The front panel and the knobs are made of plastic.
2. The back panel audio input jack and the speaker output terminals are of poor quality. Any 1000-2000 yuan CD amplifier unit is much better than this one.
3. The top cover is quite thin, and it has even sunk in on my transformer, so I had to open the box and use my hands to fix it, and the top cover and front panel became loose.
4. The center of gravity of the entire machine is tilted towards the transformer end, making it difficult to move.
It feels like a SONY entry-level machine, just like the workmanship, made in Malaysia.
I feel that Sony is much better at outsourcing production to China than Little Horse.
5. The machine is very hot, and when watching a movie on the two channels for about two hours, the top cover feels about 40-50°C when touched with your hand; I don’t know if the transformer is too large and generates a lot of heat.
Nowadays, most people use switching power supplies, and this stupid transformer probably weighs 4 kg.
Sony should have used a passive heat sink in the machine, but all we see after opening the box is a large aluminum heat sink on the pipes.

I haven't opened it yet.
The battery is in use.
I really want to dissect it and see what's inside.
Later, I thought that if I was disappointed after taking it apart, it would be a waste of money; if I was satisfied after taking it apart, it would be difficult to put it back together and I would not like it.
Well, even if Sony uses good batteries.
As for the detailed explanation of the battery, most people will feel anxious when they see it.
I'm fine. I used to work in a cell phone factory, so I'm half a battery engineer, and I can handle it, except for not understanding circuits.
It was a great surprise.
I really had no idea what I was buying until I opened the package and felt that it was genuine!
Finally, when I touched the earphone wire, I felt it was very flexible, and the quality was so good that I couldn't wait to plug it into my phone and open QQ Music.
I was shocked, the sound quality was 3D surround!
I asked in a physical communication store, and it was around 30 yuan, but it was not a branded product, but a generic one, so I would say that although this Pingsheng product is 27 yuan, it is definitely worth having because of its value for money!
The worst online shopping experience
After placing an order on September 28, the system showed that the order had been shipped, but the package was still not delivered until October 12.
When I checked the status of my Amazon order, the seller did not provide a tracking number, so I couldn’t find out where my order was.
So I emailed the seller to ask if they could provide the tracking number, but I never received a reply after two days.
In desperation, I called Amazon customer service, and they gave me the seller’s phone number. I called the seller again, and after a few attempts, the call went through. I was informed that the package was lost, and that they could send me a new one right away.
Although I was very angry, I didn't say much to the seller because I needed the computer urgently. I just asked them to send it to me right away.
The next day, I called to ask if the shipment had been sent.
The seller said it hasn't been sent yet, and it will be sent this afternoon.
I called again in the afternoon and the seller said it would be sent, but it wouldn't be sent until 5 or 6 o'clock in the evening. However, when I called back at 7 o'clock in the evening, the phone just rang and no one answered.
The third morning, I called again and asked if the goods had been shipped.
Can you tell me the order number?
The seller said it hasn't been sent, and told me to order from another store if I was in a hurry, or to wait until the afternoon if I could wait.
There’s no way around it; it will be a long wait to order from another store.
I can only ask the seller to send it out quickly.
After countless phone follow-ups, I finally received my computer on October 16.
As for the quality of the computer, I don't know, because I bought it for someone else, so I'll add a review later.
I bought it half a year ago and have only used it a few times. Now it is malfunctioning. Can you fix it?
Because I have a desktop computer, I haven’t used it much since I bought it.
I only bring it out a few times when I'm on a business trip.
Recently, when I plugged in the power supply, it didn't charge. I had to use my left and right hands to support the charging port and the cable connection a few times before it started charging.
I suspect that the interface is not properly connected, and I don't know if it can be repaired now?
It is strongly recommended that Amazon stop using EMS!
The product is five stars, the logistics is one star, and the average is three stars.
I don’t understand why Amazon would send EMS, which is not trusted by the industry; well, computers are expensive items after all!
The order after purchase showed that it was expected to be delivered on the 20th, so my family waited at home for three days!
Why does it take four or five days to send a package from Xiamen to Fuzhou?!
On the 22nd morning, the logistics arrived in Fuzhou at last, and I was ready to receive the package with a smile, but in the evening, without receiving any phone call or text message, I checked the logistics, and it turned out that it had been signed for at noon, and it even showed that I had signed for it myself!
I was shocked at that moment!
Who am I? Where am I? Is this computer really mine?
I seriously doubt life now!
I finally ran to a pickup point to get my computer back.
The specific reason is simple: the delivery person mixed up the two order numbers, but fortunately the package wasn’t lost, so it’s all good.
I strongly recommend that Amazon stop using EMS. If Amazon continues to use EMS for its express delivery, I will definitely stop buying from them.
The goods are not bad.
First of all, I bought it a few days ago and found that it was reduced in price, and I left a bad review. The product is still not bad, and it has a good price-performance ratio. The CPU and graphics card are enough to handle mainstream online games and a considerable number of large single-player games. The heat dissipation is very good, but the screen is a little dim (a common problem with IPS screens), the sound quality is not very good, and the hard drive is not very good (I suggest you spend some money to add a solid-state drive). I took the computer to the after-sales service center yesterday to check the hardware, and there were no problems. The built-in Windows 8.1 is not very good, and I recommend upgrading to 10. The seller shipped the product very quickly, and also answered all my questions very quickly. I received the invoice the day after I received the computer. It’s good, but it’s a shame that there were no gifts.
(By the way, if you want to buy keyboard skins, don’t go to a store called E Cool Digital Center on Taobao; they are slow to ship, the quality is poor, they don’t refund or exchange products if there are problems, and the boss curses a lot; I’m exposing them specifically).
The products are good, but the platform is still bureaucratic.
The hard drive is of very good quality and has an excellent price-to-performance ratio. It is cheaper than buying one in Hong Kong, and if you can wait for the shipping, I would definitely recommend purchasing one.
But I have to say that the bureaucracy of the Amazon platform is still the same as it was a few years ago when I swore I would never use it again. You can never find out the actual status of your shipment. Information is always sent a few weeks later, and you can never complain. That’s just how bureaucratic it is!
The goods have been received a few days ago, but the logistics information says you will receive the goods in 10 days!
Logistics is not selfish.
It came like this, not only was the packaging crushed, but the electrical packaging was open, and I don't know if the contents were tampered with.
FYI
I haven't tried it yet, but I always trust Philips, and I hope the battery life is longer than other brands.
After searching online, I found that this is a common problem with water damage, and it is not covered by the warranty.
I'm so sad!
Now I wrap it in plastic wrap and continue to use it, but I don't know how long it will last.
Bought from someone who has already taken it apart.
It is indeed quite expensive to pay more than 100 yuan in tax for a machine that costs more than 300 yuan. Now, I feel more at ease.
When I received it, the seal looked like it had been opened, like it had been taken apart. I immediately took a photo, and sure enough, it opened easily. After opening it, the paper inside was damaged. I was worried that it was returned by someone else, so I quickly tried it out on my husband before the anniversary. Unfortunately, the machine didn’t turn on at all. Fortunately, there was no debris in the blade, or I would have had to return it from a long distance!
It is not known whether it is good to use or whether there will be any problems in the short term; as with the previous reviews, the stuff that is sent out when there is a shortage is not reliable!
The experience is slightly above average.
It's pretty much top-of-the-line electric, with a lot of different brushing modes, but few people change modes every day.
I used it for half a year without any problems. I brushed it every day, and it was charged once every 1.5 weeks.
The brush heads are also cheaper on Amazon.
The app is a bit difficult to use. Except for changing the colors, the other issues that seem to be compatible are due to the overseas version?
Those who want to learn the Great Law.
It is very cost-effective.
I have used it 3-4 times.
1. The packaging is in good condition.
2. It is very easy to use and convenient to clean.
3. You can do your own hair styling, which saves money.
Overall, a very successful purchase.
There are counterfeit products.
Last time I bought two packs, and it turned out that they were two different versions. The words in the lower left corner of the packaging were green, but one of them was not, and the words were white. As a result, the cat got sick after eating it.
I am not sure if the products Amazon sent me are fake or if they were dropped by the employees during shipping.
I will buy it again, but if it is a fake, I will hold you responsible.
It's a crossbar!
The picture on Amazon shows a bracket, but they sent me a bar. Isn’t that cheating?
The results are okay.
The most important thing is that Kitty likes to eat.
It really works.
Tight, narrow, foot binding, foot pad.
Not recommended.
1. The UN is Clarks’ most comfortable series, but unfortunately this one is too bad.
Addendum: Today, I compared the previous UN series footrests (I kept the footrest while throwing away the shoes), and the material is much worse than before, the elasticity is not as good as before, and the breathability is not as good as before, it is just fake soft.
2. My heels are not very high, and the point where I kick is about 3 inches forward from the highest point of my heels.
3. I bought three pairs of Clarks overseas, but only one pair fits.
I was so scared that I deleted all the music in my playlist.
Try rockport again, if it doesn't work, you can only go to the Ecco physical store.
Second-rate substitutes, poor quality control
First of all, it is worth mentioning that Prime overseas purchases Ups is very powerful, and I received the package on the 6th after placing the order on the 31st.
The shoes are much more attractive than the picture shows, and the leather feels great.
The shoe size is slightly larger, 25 is 10.5 wide and 7.5 long, and it feels a little loose when I put it on, but I usually like to wear slightly loose shoes, and I put in a pair of insoles that fit perfectly.
Secondly, the shoe reviewer really can’t praise this shoe; one sole had a damaged adhesive, while the other had various scratches and pinholes, and the adhesive strip was misaligned at the connection point between the shoe upper and sole, which was blatantly substandard!
I regret it a little!
You can get this Arthus-Bertrand for 280 yuan, which is a pretty good deal for the price; of course, there are even lower prices if you look at the reviews.
Now let's talk about the shoes. The pros: the shoes are light, running in them is comfortable, and they fit well and don't fall apart.
It looks great, but the flaws are also obvious: I usually wear a size 40, but I bought a 40.5 this time, and there is about the width of a thumb at the front of the shoe when I put it on, but that doesn’t matter.
These shoes are very "narrow," although there is still some space in front, but they feel tight.
There is one more thing, the shoes are not breathable, and I feel like my feet are hot.
Heel pad
First of all, the shoes are well made and worth the price.
My feet are pretty standard, I wear a size uk7.5, eu41.5, and a size uk6.5 for shoes. I’ve bought a few pairs of shoes from Amazon’s Aibee, and they’ve never been uncomfortable, but these shoes are a size uk7, and they’re noticeably longer than my usual size. However, because the insole is so thick, it’s still pressing down on the back of my foot, which is uncomfortable. Additionally, these shoes are very hard, which makes it difficult to wear them.
If your feet are not particularly thin, I would not recommend buying this product.
If you must buy them, you can always change the insoles, but the original insoles look very high-end, so there’s no need to be disappointed.
A very perfect shopping experience!
I am very satisfied and love it very much. There is no doubt that Amazon Global Sourcing sells authentic products. The quality is also very good, and the price is reasonable. I feel safe when I buy from Amazon. The after-sales service is very thoughtful, and the customer service staff are very friendly and patient when handling problems. They have perfectly solved my worries. The delivery service is very convenient and reliable, and the delivery person is very thoughtful and will remind customers to pick up their orders from the delivery box in a timely manner. Thank you, Amazon, for providing such a comfortable shopping experience for customers.
In short, we all like to shop on Amazon Global!
Absolutely negative reviews!
It is truly ridiculous for this agency and Amazon.
In the future, be careful when buying electronic products on Amazon.
Although it has been a long time, I still have to come and complain.
I bought it on sale during the winter for less than 200 yuan, and I haven't used it in my home for a few months.
When I needed it in the spring, I found that it couldn't connect to my watch, and both devices' manuals said they supported each other. Later, I found out that it was a problem with the heart rate monitor, because I tried to connect it to another device and it still didn't work.
I called Amazon and asked them to contact the agency, which then told me to pay for the device to be sent to Shanghai for testing.
After almost half a month, the items were sent back to me in their original condition, including the shipping box I had used when I sent them!
No response or acknowledgement, and no test reports!
At least tell me if it's good or bad!
I called to ask, and they said that sending it back in this way indicated that the device was fine, which is good.
But I still can't connect, and the agency responds: It's not their problem.
I'm unlucky, I don't want to be bothered for something that costs 200 yuan.
There is a serious mismatch between supply and demand.
It's a case of the wrong product at the wrong time.
The headband material is of good quality.
It's much better than Nike.
It is also very breathable.
Just the hat in front.
Very fine.
Are you trying to be funny?!
It completely blocks out the sun.
The reason for not returning the product is because the headband function is good.
It is worn on the head, but it does not block the sun.
But it is different from other headband styles.
Save it for later.
The quality of the goods is good, Amazon lacks a sense of contract, and the delivery person is great.
I require delivery on Saturday and Sunday!
Amazon's rules do not allow for deliveries on Saturdays or Sundays.
I was so annoyed that I drove 200 kilometers from the countryside to come and pick it up!
Amazon, how can I love you more?
The delivery person was very active and enthusiastic.
Give it a thumbs up!
The goods, I tried them out and they are not bad.
However, I have never bought similar products before, so I can’t compare prices!
Size and logistics
The workmanship is good, but the logistics are too slow. Previously, all the shoes were delivered by DHL. This time, Apex was... I have bought a lot of UA in China, and the prices are not low. I feel that the quality is higher than NIKE and ADIDAS?
They are all the same, so I buy them online.
Size: I am 176cm tall and weigh 68kg. My shoulders are wide, and I usually wear clothes that are size 180. I bought an M and the hem is slightly long. Everything else fits perfectly. I see that there are recommendations for S size. Is your figure so slim that you prefer a smaller size? I think a looser-fitting sweater would be better.
Just the right size.
Chest size: 99; height: 184 cm; weight: 84 kg; before purchasing, I consulted customer service and was told that I should buy an XL, then I decided to buy L after reading the reviews, and when I received the package, I found that it was the perfect size, and I almost got scammed.
The prices of Double 11 are much higher than those of Black Friday.
The quality of the clothes is very good.
The problem with cheap goods is troublesome!
The order was placed on the 18th, and the goods were only received on the 25th, the speed of snails from Guangzhou to Beijing!
I bought this item because it was cheap, and the description said it had scratches, but when I received the package, I found that 4 screws and nuts were missing!
The child didn’t want to return the item, thinking it wasn’t a big deal, but the accessory is a small part, and the child’s grandfather couldn’t find it in any of the hardware stores nearby!
Finally, Grandpa stuck it on!
It seems that we can’t buy Z affordable products anymore!
The toy is of poor quality.
Most of the screw holes were not aligned, and it was difficult to screw them in, indicating poor workmanship. It is unclear how long it will last, as it was a promise made to a child, so it cannot be returned.
Other reviews say it was easy to install, so is it just my one that has a problem?
It's pretty average.
Is it just bad luck?
The packaging is outdated; the workmanship is poor; there is only one type of music, and it is only 8 seconds long and then repeats; the action is just nodding your head and walking forward, with no changes.
Not worth the price.
If you need it urgently, you can't return it.
The toy is of good quality, but I have to complain about the packaging.
I received a package delivered by EMS yesterday, which was purchased from Amazon. It was finally delivered by the courier of Tmall. How many twists and turns did it go through? Is the relationship between Amazon and Tmall still good?
As for the packaging, it was wrapped in several layers of cling film, and there was not even a piece of plastic packaging foam inside. When I opened it, all the parts were in an empty box, which was fun, but the toy was of good quality and did not have any broken parts. However, it was smaller than I had imagined, because it was not battery-operated, and it often derailed when pushed by hand, and I felt that the gap between the tracks was too large, which was an unreasonable design.
Good quality, fun to play.
It's a lot of fun, the components are very precise and well-made, and the quality is almost the same as Lego. The price is very reasonable for events.
The process of assembling it was fun, and my 5-year-old son came to play with me, and it was great.
He laughed and laughed while playing it ~ he will probably continue to buy toys of this brand in the future.
The phone is new and the shopping from overseas was great.
I watched it for Christmas, and it was 150 yuan more expensive than before, but it is taking a while to ship.
The machines are pretty good, they are all new.
Built-in Pikachu.
Then, if you connect the spirit balls, you will receive a dream.
It’s fun to play, and it’s more portable than a PS4.
I have already bought Zelda, and I will try it again after playing it.
Producing bad products, selling bad products, and as a result, providing bad services. The person who bought six watches to give to their children found that one of the numbers was not complete, and that all six watches were not in sync, differing by a dozen or so hours.
I contacted the manufacturer and asked if there was a verification time when the watch was put into storage. They replied “yes”, but if there was, why was the time so different? It was obvious that the watch was not accurate, and simply put, it was a counterfeit product. It wasn’t my fault, but it was obvious that there was a quality problem (the digital display was not complete). They even sold the watch with these problems. Was it a fake product?
I contacted the seller, who gave me a long list of reasons, and also complained that I shouldn't have bought their product in the first place, that kind of product, that kind of seller, that kind of after-sales service, who would dare to buy anything on Amazon in the future.
In short, I recommend not to buy anything from this seller, even if you do, it will be junk.
Amazon shipping problems
After receiving the goods, an inspection revealed:
1. The box is severely damaged.
2. The table instructions have serious wrinkles.
3. The clock does not have a battery and cannot be charged, and the time cannot be adjusted.
4. Contact Amazon customer service separately, and you can only ship it to the United States at your own expense, and you will be reimbursed for the shipping fee.
5. The reason for a score of 2 is that the customer service is still good.
I can only say it's passable.
The time is not very accurate, it's about a second fast per day, and it's been almost two and a half months since I started using it.
I used to have a Seatlelty card and I think it lasted a couple of years without any problems.
The calendar function is pretty good, but the timer function is a bit useless, and you accidentally enter the timer mode from time to time.
Solar-powered watch
Advantages: solar charging, no need to worry about replacing batteries, world time, multiple alarms and reminders at the hour.
The downside: mirrors are easy to scratch and get dirty.
Value for money: domestic prices are generally between 220 and 300 yuan, and overseas purchases cost more than 180 yuan (delivery takes about a week).
Very satisfied with the watch.
It must be authentic, as I checked it at the specialty store. The appearance of the watch is beautiful, and it is well-made and of good quality. It is also an imported mechanical movement, so it has some weight to it. It is not something that so-called mechanical watches that cost three or four hundred yuan can compare with. This is a genuine product.
The watch is very accurate in terms of timing, with errors well within acceptable limits. The watch comes with a jewelry certification, and the 12 on the dial is indeed a real diamond. It's perfect for me to wear, and it's also a great gift to give.
The Benelli shotgun is indeed good.
The worst shopping experience ever.
On the evening of September 23, my wife dropped her phone, and I immediately ordered an 8P from Amazon Malaysia. The product was in stock, but it was not self-sold and there was no markup (I was secretly happy), and because it was not self-sold, the delivery was slower. The system showed that the expected delivery date was September 27.
My wife, who couldn't stand it, died from not having a phone. The next morning at around 6:30, she asked me to think of a solution. Later, when I checked JD.com, I saw that there were 256G models in stock that could be delivered the same day. I had no choice but to immediately order another one.
I bought a new one, and immediately thought about canceling the Amazon order.
Since the order was placed in the middle of the night, it was impossible to pick up the package in the morning, so at around 7:00 a.m., I called customer service to request cancellation of the order, and the customer service representative replied that the order had been canceled and that I should wait for a text message confirmation.
Okay, I’ll just wait patiently, and when I checked my phone at noon, the order was still in the “not shipped” status, so I immediately contacted customer service to request that they cancel the order as soon as possible, and the customer service representative replied that it had been processed.
When I checked my phone at 3 pm, the order was still there. I had no choice but to contact customer service again to clarify that I had called three times, and to ask them to cancel the order and inform the seller that they must not ship the item!
The customer service representative contacted the seller immediately after I requested it, and informed me that the seller was not familiar with the system and that I would have to wait until the seller was familiar with the system before the order could be canceled.
However, I have clearly informed the seller, who knows about it, that the goods will not be shipped, so please rest assured.
I checked the order status on Monday and found that it had already been shipped, leaving me speechless.
Unable to contact the seller directly, I had to call customer service again.
The handling afterwards was simply ridiculous; basically, I would say one thing, and the customer service representative would then do something else.
The order is still in the status of refusal to accept delivery, and we are preparing to send it again!
Won't Amazon follow up on this on its own?
The seller’s company received the money anyway, so it doesn’t matter if they don’t follow up.
In summary, we will never prepay for large items in the future, as this is too much trouble.
It looks beautiful.
I had my eye on this camera for a long time, but I didn't buy it because of some other reasons besides the price. This time, I bought it because it was included in the free shipping offer, and the price was still reasonable.
There were no problems with the other things I bought, but when I tried to connect the software, I couldn’t connect at all. My router is a TP router, and after searching online, I found that many people had this problem. I spent more than two hours changing the settings on the router, and finally, I was able to connect using 360WIFI as a medium. In the meantime, I called the Mi customer service, but they didn’t have any solutions to this problem. They directly told me to contact Amazon for after-sales service.
Another thing worth noting is that I saw a user comment online saying that the camera supports a minimum of 8G memory card, and smaller storage capacity will not be recognized, so please be aware of this.
It feels good to use, and the image is acceptable, but the sound quality is poor, and the machine has a certain degree of heat, and if it is turned on all the time, the heat level is a bit hard to accept.
As mentioned above, there are many shortcomings in this product, so please be careful when you buy it.
I gave it 3 stars because I bought this for my first love, we were together for almost 3 years, and he left me last year. It’s still the case to this day.
I gave it 3 stars because I bought it for my first love, but I don’t know how much I’ll use it anymore, maybe I’ll just throw it away!
We had been together for almost 3 years, and she left me last year. Whenever I think of her now, I feel so sad that I want to leave this world. The first woman in my life, who brought me shadows and sadness for a lifetime, and I still haven't been able to get over it.
When I bought this phone, I thought about two things that I felt at the time, that we could endure hardships together, but now it is unbearable to think about. Maybe life is like this, some people never want to meet, and some things you never want to know, but what can you do?
How many times have I seen a Samsung phone and thought of her? The pain that comes with it is overwhelming. I have never been willing to spend more than 2,000 yuan on a phone, but when I bought one for her, I didn't hesitate. No matter how much you love someone, if they change their mind, all the promises and vows in the world will be meaningless.
High-quality products among domestic brands
Huawei is a premium product among domestic products.
The low-key CEO and the company rely on technology and quality to win customers, which is completely different from the current business trend of relying on advertising to increase brand awareness!
Enterprises without strength are absolutely not able to do this, and they are also not daring to do this!
It is precisely because of this that I chose Huawei.
I bought it more than half a year ago and it has been working great, it's really good.
The reason I didn't give it a perfect score is because once, when I was using its offline navigation, it had a positioning problem, and I couldn't find the cause. Other times, it worked fine.
Moreover, its online input is great for finding destinations, and after searching, it automatically designs a route. After leaving Wi-Fi, its offline navigation function is very useful, as it doesn’t use up your data plan. It directly communicates with satellites to achieve location and navigation, which is great!
Sony is great.
Sony's low-end phone still has a great design, and it's cheap, with a large screen and great battery life, making it perfect for the elderly.
Although a long time has passed, the machine still works perfectly.
However, since my Z2 was downgraded, this phone has also fulfilled its mission.
