4.1 Overview
The characters included in this document are encoded in single-byte, double-byte, or four-byte encoding.
The single-byte section includes all 128 characters from 0x00 to 0x7F of GB/T 11383-1989.
4.3 Double-byte section
The double-byte section includes all the graphic characters in GB/T 2312-1980, the CJK unified Chinese characters in GB/T 13000, and some graphic characters.
The characters in the double-byte section shall be in accordance with the provisions of Appendix A.
Among them, the graphics, code positions, and functions of the descriptive characters of the symbol descriptor should comply with the provisions of Appendix B.
Note: GB/T 13000 is the unified coding for Chinese characters used in countries and regions such as China, Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam.
Chinese characters with unique abstract shapes are assigned separate code positions; Chinese characters with the same abstract shapes but different origins are assigned shared code positions.
The encoded Chinese characters are called CJK Unified Ideographs, where CJK represents China, Japan, and Korea.
4.4 Four-byte section
The four-byte section includes 66 CJK unified Chinese characters (9FA6 to 9FEF, excluding 8 characters from 9FB4 to 9FBB) from GB/T 13000 that are not included in the two-byte characters. It also includes CJK unified Chinese characters extension A, CJK unified Chinese characters extension B, CJK unified Chinese characters extension C, CJK unified Chinese characters extension D, CJK unified Chinese characters extension E, CJK unified Chinese characters extension F, and a few minority ethnic characters that have been encoded in GB/WORK 13000.
The characters in the four-byte section shall be in accordance with the provisions of Appendix C.
5 Overall Structure
In the main text, any number preceded by 0x indicates hexadecimal, while those without 0x indicate decimal.
In the appendix, all coded representations are in hexadecimal, while other numbers are represented in decimal.
The single-byte part adopts the encoding structure of GB/T 11383-1989, using code points from 0x00 to 0x7F.
The double-byte Gong section uses two eight-bit binary strings to represent one character. The first byte code ranges from 0x81 to 0xFE, and the second byte code ranges from 0x40 to 0x7E and 0x80 to 0xFE respectively.
The four-byte part uses the suffix 0x30-0x39, which is not used in GB/工 11383-1989, as an extension for double-byte encoding. The encoding range is from 0x81308130 to 0xFE39FE39.
The first character of a four-byte character has an encoding range of 0x81 to 0xFE; the second character has an encoding range of 0x30 to 0x39; the third character has an encoding range of 0x81 to 0xFE; the fourth character has an encoding range of 0x30 to 0x39. In other words: 0x81308130 to 0x81308139; 0x81308230 to 0x81308239; 0x8130FEFE30 to 0x8130FE39; 0x81318130 to 0x81318139; Oo2douolag0c "0URo23061393 0xFE39FE30 to 0xFE39FE39.
Overall structure and code range allocation can be seen in Figure 1 and Table 1.

This manual page content is excerpted from the complete documentation of the GNU C compiler and is only limited to explaining the meanings of the options.
Unless someone volunteers to maintain it, the EURo file and Info file are authoritative documents.
If there are any contradictions between the manual and the software, please refer to Info for verification.
If we find that the content of this manual page has caused obvious confusion and complaints due to being outdated, we will stop publishing it. There is no other choice but to update the Info file and the man page at the same time, as there is no time left for us to do this work while maintaining GNU cc. The GNU project considers the man page to be an outdated product and believes that time should be spent elsewhere.
If you need complete and up-to-date documents, please refer to the Info document `gee' or the Using and Porting GNU CC (for version 2.0) (ft&/HAIZE#H GNU CC 2.0) manual. Both are derived from the Texinfo source file gee.texinfo.
Description: The C and C++ compilers are integrated. They both require one or more of the four steps to process input files: preprocessing, compilation, assembly, and linking.
The file extension of the source file indicates the language of the source file, but for the compiler, the file extension controls the default settings.
gcc believes that the preprocessed file (.i) is a C file and sets the connection in C form.
g++ considers the preprocessed file (.i) as a c++ file and sets the linking in c++ format.
The file extension indicates the language type and the subsequent operations.
.c C source code; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.C C++ source code; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.cc C++ source code; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
CXX C++ source code; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.m Objective-C source code; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
Preprocessed C file; compilation, assembly
Preprocessed C++ file; compilation, assembly
.s Assembly language source code; assembly
Assembly language source code; preprocessing, assembly
.h preprocessor file; usually not appearing on the command line, other post-level named files are passed to the linker. Typically includes:
.0 Object file
Archive file
Unless the -cec, -s, or -E options are used (or compilation errors prevent the complete process), linking is always the final step.
During the linking phase, all corresponding .e files, -1 library files, and unrecognized file names (including specified .o H header files and .a library files) are passed to the linker options (OPTIONS) in the order specified in the command line.
Options must be given separately: completely different from `-d -r'.
Most `-=E: and `-W' options have two opposite formats: -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno-name).
Here only the formats that are not default options are listed.
Below is a summary of all the options, grouped by type, with explanations provided in the following chapters.
Code Generation Option
Overall Option
Clearly indicate that the language of the input file is language (rather than the default selection obtained from the file name extension).
This option applies to all subsequent input files until encountering the next `-x' option. The language is optional.
Close any explicit instructions for the language, so process the files behind the file name suffix with the ` -x' option.
If only one part of the four stages (preprocessing, compilation, assembly, linking) is operated, you can use the `-x' option (or Ah after the file name) to tell geo where to start, use the `-c', `-s', or `-E' option to tell geo where to end. Note that some option combinations (for example, `-x cpp-output -E') will compile or assemble the source file, ETER. ERA ATI By default, GCC replaces the source file name extension `.ec' with `.o'. You can use the `-o' option to choose a different name. GCC ignores any unrecognized input after the `-ec' option -S F anything.
The target file is completed.
Stop after compilation, do not perform assembly.
Use pipes instead of temporary files during different stages of the compilation process because the assembly compilers of those systems cannot read data from pipes. GNU's assembler does not have this problem, and the assembler can accept C "dialects" that support ANSI-compliant C programs.
This will disable certain incompatible ANSI C keywords in GNU Cc, as well as trigraph features such as unix and vax that indicate rarely used ANSI trigraph features. It also prohibits the use of certain features, even though all standard libraries are available in the hosted environment, and the main function returns an int value. A typical example is almost all programs except for the kernel. In contrast, the freestanding environment does not have a standard library, and the program entry point is not necessarily main. The most obvious example is the operating system kernel. For more details, please refer to the latest information on the gcc website.
For function declarations without parameters, such as `int foo();', they are treated in C style --- that is, without specifying the number or type of parameters. (Only for C++).
Under normal circumstances, a function like foo in C++ means that the parameter is empty.
The checklist is deleted from here to try to support certain aspects of the traditional C compiler.
Please refer to the NU c manual. We have already deleted the details so that people will not be confused when the content becomes outdated.
Except for one thing: for c++ programs (not C), the `-traditional' option has an additional effect, allowing assignment to `this'.
He and the result of the '-Ethis-is-variable' option are the same.
-traditional-cpp attempts to support certain aspects of the traditional Cc preprocessor.
Especially the content mentioned above regarding the preprocessor, but excluding other effects of the `-traditional' option.
-fdollars-in-identifiers allows the use of the `$' character in identifiers (only for C++).
You can specify the "-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers" option to explicitly prohibit the use of the "$" symbol.
(GNU C++ allows the `$' symbol by default on some target systems, but not all systems.)
-fenum-int-equiv allows implicit conversion from ant type to enumeration type (MEF c++).
Under normal circumstances, GNU C++ allows conversion from enum to int, but not vice versa.
-fexternal-—templates generates smaller code (only for c++) for template declarations by generating a copy for each template function only at the place where they are defined.
To successfully use this option, you must mark `#pragma implementation` (definition) or `#pragma interface` (declaration) in all files that use the template.
When using the `-fexternal-templates` option during compilation, all template instantiations are treated as external types. You must ensure that the required instantiations appear in the implementation file.
This can be achieved through typedef, which references each required instance.
Correspondingly, if the default option `-fno-external-templates' is used during compilation, all template instances are explicitly set as built-in.
All member functions (except for constructor functions and mnew or delete member operators) are considered virtual functions of the class they belong to.
This does not indicate that every call to a member function will go through the internal virtual function table.
In some cases, the compiler can determine that a certain virtual function can be directly called; in this case, it is called directly.
-fcond-mismatch allows the second and third parameters of the conditional expression to have mismatched types.
The value of this expression is Void.-fthis-—is-variable allows assignment to this (only for c++).
After merging the user-defined free storage management mechanism into C++, the assignable `this' appears to be inappropriate.
Therefore, by default, assigning a value to this inside a class member function is an invalid operation.
However, in order to maintain backward compatibility, you can use the `-fthis-is-variable' option to make this operation effective.
-funsigned-char defines char as an unsigned type, similar to unsigned char.
All kinds of machines have their own default char type, which can be either unsigned char or signed char.
Ideally, when relying on the symbolic nature of data, a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned char.
However, many programs have already been written using only simple char, and it is expected that these are signed numbers (or unsigned numbers, depending on the target machine on which the program is written).
This option, along with its opposite option, allows the program to work on the corresponding default values.
The type of char should always be clearly defined as signed char or unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly the same as one of them.
If the `signed' or `unsigned' modifiers are not explicitly declared, these options are used to define signed bitfields or unsigned bitfields.
By default, bit fields are signed because they inherit the sign of their underlying integer type, such as int. However, if the `-traditional' option is specified, bit fields are always unsigned.
-fwritable-strings stores string constants in the writable data segment without any special treatment.
This is to be compatible with some old programs. They consider modifying string constants to be a very bad idea. The `-traditional' option has the same effect.
Executive Summary
The Impact of COVID-19 on the Drug Market
Its impact may be similar to the economic crisis in 2008.
The global COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the world into an unprecedented crisis.
In many countries, this disease has overwhelmed healthcare institutions, almost causing them to collapse. The restrictive measures implemented by governments around the world have caused serious disruptions in the global economy.
Regarding the drug market, the impact of this epidemic is still unclear and difficult to predict, but it may have far-reaching effects.
Some producers may be forced to seek new methods to manufacture drugs, as restrictions on movement also limit access to precursors and basic chemicals.
Due to travel restrictions, smugglers may have to seek new routes and methods.
The patterns of drug use and supply may change, and the government's ability to respond may also be hindered.
The changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic are unprecedented, but we can still learn some lessons from past crises.
After the 2008 economic crisis, some drug users began to seek cheaper synthetic substances, and their usage patterns shifted towards injecting drugs.
At the same time, governments around the world have reduced budgets related to drugs.
If governments of different countries respond to the current economic recession in the same way, intervention measures and drug treatment services for preventing drug abuse and related risky behaviors may be severely affected.
In addition, the priority of interception operations and international cooperation may decrease, making it easier for traffickers to operate.
Some countries have a large amount of drugs smuggled through commercial flights, and it is expected that these countries will be most directly affected by drug trafficking activities.
There are couriers who carry synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine in their personal backpacks or hide them in private luggage, sometimes in large quantities. Due to the restrictions on air passenger transport in almost all areas, the activities of supplying drugs through commercial air travel may be completely interrupted.
Although the international postal supply chain has also been disrupted, the activities of trafficking using the dark web and shipping of goods may increase.
In the long run, economic recession and related containment measures may disrupt the drug market.
Due to the rising unemployment rate and lack of opportunities, the impoverished and vulnerable groups are more likely to engage in harmful drug use, develop drug addiction, and turn to illegal activities related to drugs, whether it is production or transportation.
Drug trafficking organizations may take advantage of this situation to provide services to vulnerable groups and recruit new members to strengthen their team.
With the decrease in government's ability to respond, these changes may quickly take root and become the new reality for many communities.
Expansion and Complexity
Market growth
The population growth pattern partially explains the reason for market expansion.
The drug abuse phenomenon has been increasing all over the world, both in terms of overall numbers and the proportion of drug users in the global population.
In 2009, it was estimated that there were 210 million drug users, accounting for 4.8% of the global population aged 15-64. In 2018, it was estimated that there were 269 million drug users, accounting for 5.3% of this population.
In the past twenty years, the growth rate of drug abuse in developing countries has far exceeded that of developed countries.
This reflects to some extent the differences in overall population growth during this period, with developed countries at 7% and developing countries at 28%, but it also reflects the faster growth of the young population in developing countries.
Teenagers and young adults make up the largest proportion among drug users.
During the period from 2000 to 2018, the population in this age group in developing countries increased by 16%, while the population in this age group in developed countries decreased by 10%.
Urbanization is a driving factor in the current and future drug market.
Whether it is a developed country or a developing country, the drug situation in urban areas is more prevalent than in rural areas.
One of the reasons for the overall increase in drug addiction is the large-scale migration of the population from rural areas to urban areas. Currently, more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas, compared to 34% in 1960.
Urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, especially in developing countries where urbanization trends are more prominent.
The increase in wealth is associated with the increase in drug abuse, but the greatest burden of disease is borne by the poorest people worldwide. Drug abuse is more prevalent in developed countries than in developing countries.
Drugs like cocaine are particularly closely linked to wealthier regions in the world.
Similarly, within each country, the prevalence of drug use is higher among the affluent social class.
However, the rate of drug addiction is higher among individuals with lower socioeconomic status.
Data from a few select countries indicate a correlation between harmful drug use patterns and low income levels.
These patterns seem to be less common among the wealthier social classes.
The global COVID-19 crisis is likely to exacerbate the risks faced by the most vulnerable groups, including drug users, due to economic constraints.
For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment rates, have always been associated with an increase in drug use in the past, and this pandemic has already forced tens of millions of people worldwide to become unemployed.
The COVID-19 pandemic may lead to further expansion of the drug market. The widespread outbreak of COVID-19 could result in more farmers engaging in illegal crop cultivation, either due to a decrease in the control capacity of national regulatory authorities or because more people may be forced to take risks and engage in illegal activities during an economic crisis.
The related restrictions measures of COVID-19 have led to a decrease in air and land transportation, which may have resulted in an increase in maritime smuggling. The risk of interception at sea is low, and there are more cases of smuggling compared to air or land routes.
Recently, there have been reports that cocaine shipments are being transported directly from South America to Europe via sea routes.
Increased complexity
The presence of non-internationally controlled substances remains stable, but there is an increasing number of new types of opioids with potential harm, making the drug market increasingly complex.
In addition to plant-based substances such as marijuana, cocaine, and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control. The non-medical use of pharmaceuticals is also rapidly increasing.
The domestic market of member countries has approximately 500 new types of active substances each year.
Currently, the majority of them are stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and a small amount of opioids.
Although the overall quantity of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportion has changed.
In the total number of newly identified psychoactive substances in 2014, the category of new psychoactive substances similar to opioids accounted for only 2%. However, by 2018, this number had risen to 9%.
There are many analogues of fentanyl in the new types of psychoactive substances similar to opioids, and their pharmacological effects and harms have been proven. They have caused overdose deaths in North America and to a lesser extent in other regions.
In North America, fentanyl is sometimes used as an adulterant for heroin and other drugs (including cocaine and methamphetamine), and sometimes used to produce counterfeit pharmaceutical opioids.
Some evidence suggests that there is also a phenomenon of injecting new psychoactive substances as stimulants in Europe: a study on residual injection syringes in six European cities found that many syringes were contaminated with new psychoactive substances that have stimulating effects.
The use of two new psychoactive substances may gradually become firmly established among vulnerable groups.
A single type of new psychoactive substance has rarely formed a large market.
However, evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among socially marginalized groups such as the homeless and prison inmates.
22 countries have reported the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, with the majority of countries identifying synthetic cannabinoids as the main challenge.
The regulation of precursor chemicals has forced drug manufacturers to innovate. Many chemicals commonly used as precursors to synthesize drugs such as methamphetamine, amphetamine, and ecstasy have been placed under international control.
Drug traffickers and drug manufacturers have always been searching for alternatives, not only substances with looser regulations, but also chemicals specifically designed to evade regulation, known as "specially made precursors".
Restrictive measures aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19 are likely to further squeeze drug producers who rely on precursor chemicals.
Evidence from Mexico suggests that this has become a reality: according to reports, in March 2020, a shortage of methamphetamine precursors imported from East Asia led to an increase in methamphetamine prices in Mexico and the United States.
The market is ever-changing.
Synthetic drugs are replacing opiate drugs in Central Asia and the Russian Federation.
The opiate market in Central Asia and the Russian Federation seems to have undergone changes between 2008 and 2018.
The quantity of seized opioids by the Russian authorities has decreased by about 80%, while the number of people receiving treatment for the use of synthetic opioids has significantly decreased.
But the market for performance-enhancing drugs seems to be growing.
There is evidence to suggest that methamphetamine and various types of ketamine, including methoxy-methamphetamine and alpha-pyrrolidinopentiophenone, are now widely available in the Russian drug market.
Russian authorities reported that the number of secret processing sites for manufacturing various illegal drugs recently seized has sharply increased, more than doubling in two years, reaching 152 processing sites in 2018.
Growth of methamphetamine market in Afghanistan and Iraq
As early as 2012, investigations into hospital, prison, and other institutional personnel had already revealed the significance of methamphetamine in Iraq.
Crystal methamphetamine has become another major drug of concern, in addition to "phenylpropanolamine" and tramadol.
A research conducted in 2015 further confirmed these findings, with drug users stating that marijuana is more difficult to obtain compared to "phenethylamine" or methamphetamine.
Recently, the Iraqi authorities have discovered multiple methamphetamine processing sites. The Narcotics Control Bureau has expressed concern over the large-scale import of pseudoephedrine preparations, as these processing sites use them as precursors.
In Afghanistan, the production of methamphetamine seems to have started in 2014.
Since then, the seizure amount of methamphetamine has been steadily increasing.
However, the seizure amount in the first half of 2019 increased significantly compared to the previous year, reaching 657 kilograms.
In other countries, a large amount of methamphetamine believed to originate from Afghanistan has been seized, indicating that the country's production is rapidly increasing.
Policy Changes and Trends of Change
In jurisdictions where non-medical use of marijuana is legalized, there is generally a trend of increased marijuana usage.
Canada, Uruguay, and 11 jurisdictions in the United States allow the production of marijuana products for non-medical use.
In most jurisdictions, there has been an increase in marijuana use since its legalization, although the same trend has also been observed in jurisdictions where non-medical use of marijuana has not been legalized.
The two states in the United States, Colorado and Washington, were the first to pass legislation on the non-medical use of marijuana. The number of adults using marijuana has increased, especially in the past month and those who use it daily or almost daily. Since 2012, it has already exceeded the national average level.
All indicators show that since 2011, the use of marijuana in Uruguay has increased, with usage last month nearly doubling.
This indicates that the main reason for the increase is frequent and frequent use of marijuana.
The short-term data from Canada also indicates that while the legal market expanded from 2018 to 2019, the usage also increased.
However, in 2019, 40% of marijuana users still obtained certain products from illegal sources.
Is the reason behind the sharp decline in global marijuana seizures due to marijuana legalization?
In 2018, the global seizure of cannabis reached its lowest level in 20 years, mainly due to a decrease in seizure quantities in North America, which has dropped by 84% in the past decade.
In contrast, the seizure amount in other regions of the world during the same period has almost doubled. The pattern of seizures indicates that the policy aimed at opening up the marijuana market has played a key role in the decline.
The regulation of new psychoactive substances seems to have a restraining effect. It is still difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of the regulation of new psychoactive substances domestically.
Some countries with different regulatory systems for new psychoactive substances show different prevalence rates of new psychoactive substance use.
In some other countries, after domestic legislation, the use of new psychoactive substances has decreased to some extent.
Vulnerable groups face harm from both legal and illegal drug markets. Medicinal opioids used for pain management and palliative care are mainly available in high-income countries, with uneven distribution across regions.
In 2018, more than 90% of all medicinal opioids available for medical consumption were in high-income countries.
Approximately 50% are in North America, 40% are in Europe, and 2% are in Oceania.
The population of these countries accounts for approximately 12% of the global population.
According to estimates, the population of low-income and middle-income countries accounts for 88% of the global population, but the consumption of medicinal opioids is less than 10%.
Obstacles to obtaining medicinal opioids are related to many factors, including legislation, culture, healthcare systems, and prescription practices.
People who are relatively poor are at a higher risk of drug addiction. In 2018, approximately 35.6 million people were suffering from drug addiction.
Poverty, limited education, and social marginalization may increase the risk of drug addiction and exacerbate its consequences. Research in high-income countries has confirmed this point, showing that individuals with unfavorable socioeconomic trajectories are not only associated with their current situation but also with the risk of drug addiction.
Drug addiction can deepen social and economic disadvantages, further increasing the risks of unemployment, poverty, and homelessness, thus perpetuating a vicious cycle of disadvantage. These outcomes may also be related to the derogatory attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.
Women, ethnic minorities, immigrants, diverse sexual orientations, people displaced by armed conflicts or disasters, as well as individuals in rural environments, may also be disproportionately affected by drug addiction or encounter difficulties in accessing treatment services.
According to the Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) indicator, which estimates the years of healthy life lost due to disability and premature death, the harmful use of drugs has exacerbated its broader social impact over the past 10 years.
Between 2007 and 2018, the global disability-adjusted life years attributed to drug use increased by 17%.
The disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) increase caused by untreated hepatitis C-related liver cancer is particularly high among injection drug users, reaching 40%.
The relationship between drugs and violence is intricate and difficult to determine all causal relationships between the use of psychoactive substances and violence.
Limited global data suggests that intoxication may be a significant factor in causing deaths.
But in violent incidents, the role of alcohol seems to be greater than that of drugs.
Although drug use may lead to crime, in certain situations, this connection can be partially attributed to various mediating factors, such as socio-economic disadvantages and other types of adversity caused by individual risks, family environment, and peer influence.
The connection between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.
If there is already a stable criminal structure, including large-scale organized crime activities such as international drug trafficking, it is possible to carry out these activities without violence.
In the short term, the existence and extent of violence depend not so much on the quantity of trafficking, but rather on certain changes that destabilize the balance of power between organized crime groups, such as changes in the size of the illegal market, the death or imprisonment of notorious criminals, and law enforcement measures that weaken one group compared to another.
Latest trend
Marijuana is the most commonly used substance, and opioids pose the greatest harm.
According to estimates, there were 192 million people using marijuana in 2018, making it the most widely used drug globally.
In contrast, there were 58 million people using synthetic opioids in 2018.
However, the related harms of opioid drugs are often overlooked due to their relatively low number of users.
In 2017, out of an estimated 167,000 deaths related to drug addiction, 66% were caused by these substances. Out of the 21 million years of life lost due to disability or premature death believed to be caused by drug addiction, 50% were caused by these substances.
The non-medical use of synthetic opioids has intensified the public health crisis.
In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, tramadol exacerbates the opioid crisis; in North America, it is fentanyl. These two regions have almost no commonalities in terms of economy, demographic data, or general drug use patterns, but they are both striving to combat the opioid crisis fueled by easily accessible and low-cost substances.
In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has led to an increase in overdose deaths from opioids in the past 20 years.
In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 registered overdose deaths in the United States involved fentanyl.
Canada has also reported similar results, but the numbers are lower.
One of the reasons for the excessive deaths caused by fentanyl is that the efficacy of fentanyl in the illegal drug market is unpredictable.
In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, the market for non-medical use of tramadol has seen significant growth.
In this region, there are more and more patients with symptoms receiving treatment using Quamadol.
In 2017, the global seizure of tramadol significantly increased, reaching a peak of over 125 tons.
However, in 2018, after the implementation of a new law in India to regulate the use of curcumin, the global seizure amount dropped to 32 tons.
The cause of the crisis in these two places is the simplicity of manufacturing and low production costs. In addition, there is a lack of international regulation on tramadol and many fentanyl analogues or their precursors.
What worsens the crisis in these two places is that these substances are available in both the pharmaceutical market and the illegal market, making it even more difficult to detect and prevent their abuse.
The use of performance-enhancing drugs is increasing.
In the field of doping, cocaine and methamphetamine are the main substances, and the use of these two substances is increasing in their main markets.
In 2018, there were approximately 19 million people using cocaine, as it is quite popular in North America and Western Europe.
In the same year, approximately 27 million people used methamphetamine, with methamphetamine being the most commonly used amphetamine stimulant in Southeast Asia and North America.
According to the majority of indicators, the use of methamphetamine in these two regions has been expanding for the past 20 years.
In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist, sometimes as substitutes for each other. When the usage of one drug increases, the usage of the other drug decreases, and sometimes both drugs increase or decrease simultaneously to meet the demand of the same market.
The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk for injection drug users.
According to estimates, around 11.3 million people injected drugs in 2018, and approximately 10% of global HIV infections were caused by drug injection.
More than one million drug users have been infected with HIV, and there are 5.5 million people with hepatitis C.
In 2017, approximately 585,000 people died from drug abuse, with half of them dying from liver diseases caused by hepatitis C, and most of the injection drug users with hepatitis C still have not received treatment.
The shortage of opioids caused by the COVID-19 restrictions may lead users to substitute them with substances such as alcohol or benzodiazepines that are easier to obtain, or mix opioids with synthetic drugs.
As some users switch to injection or inject more frequently, there may be more harmful ways of use.

EU summit debates refugee policy, EU officials: reception process bottleneck at every step - China News Network
The EU summit is embroiled in constant disputes over refugee policies, with EU officials stating that there are bottlenecks at every step of the reception process.
According to a report from Agence France-Presse on February 10th, during the latest European Union summit on that day, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that EU leaders agreed to implement stricter policies on illegal immigration in order to facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants.
According to reports, the European Union's move is a response to the growing concern over illegal immigration in Europe. Currently, the core issue for the European Union is that very few illegal immigrants can be repatriated in the end.
According to the summit document, EU leaders called on the Commission to "immediately mobilize a large amount of EU funds" to strengthen external borders through infrastructure and surveillance measures.
However, the European Union and its member states have been arguing incessantly over issues such as fence cost payment.
Friedlein repeatedly stated that EU funds will not cover the related expenses.
However, some officials from member countries have stated that if the European Union can share the burden of installing cameras, watchtowers, and other infrastructure along the external borders, this will free up national budgets and accelerate the construction process.
The European website Euractiv reported that EU officials admitted that there are bottlenecks at every step of the refugee reception process. The limited reception capacity and overwhelmed immigration authorities in member states are unable to prevent refugees from submitting "countless" asylum applications in various EU countries. The EU's refugee reception system is in a state of almost "permanent crisis".
According to the European Commission, the Schengen countries of the European Union received over 920,000 asylum applications last year, an increase of nearly half compared to the previous year.
At the same time, the European Union recorded over 330,000 cases of illegal entry last year.
In this context, the summit also reached an agreement on a "principle", which is that EU countries can repatriate illegal immigrants based on the court rulings of another member state.
In addition, the report states that EU leaders have also agreed to "increase the use of the concept of security nation," which will pave the way for the EU to develop a common list.

The United States' escalation of the "chip war" has dealt a heavy blow to the global semiconductor industry - China News Network.
Recently, the "chip war" between the United States and China has been escalating. First, under pressure from the United States, the Netherlands and Japan agreed to initiate controls on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China. Then, foreign media reported that the US government is considering cutting off all connections between US suppliers and Huawei, prohibiting US suppliers from providing any products to Huawei. The Biden administration is also preparing to announce an executive order to restrict US investment in sensitive Chinese technology industries... Shortly after the start of 2023, the United States continues to employ malicious tactics to contain the development of China's semiconductor industry.
In recent years, the United States has never stopped its actions to hinder China's "core" development. On one hand, it accurately suppresses the semiconductor production and supply chain to China, and on the other hand, it constructs a "de-Chinaization" alliance in the semiconductor industry chain, aiming to completely "leave China behind" in the advanced semiconductor industry.
Whether it is to win over South Korea and establish a "technology alliance," or to establish a "quadrilateral alliance" with South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan in the semiconductor industry, or to establish a "small circle" of the semiconductor industry chain through mechanisms such as the US-Japan-India-Australia "Quad mechanism" and the "Indo-Pacific Economic Framework," the United States is attempting to introduce politicization, campification, and weaponization into the semiconductor industry in order to build a closed production and supply chain cycle dominated by the United States, thereby making up for its shortcomings in the chip manufacturing field and maintaining its dominant position in the global chip industry.
However, the United States' high-profile "chip warfare" against China is also a case of "hurting the enemy by a thousand while damaging oneself by eight hundred."
Recently, Lam Research, a well-known American chip manufacturing equipment supplier, announced that it will lay off 1,300 full-time employees and plans to lay off an additional 1,400 temporary employees in the next two quarters due to the latest round of export bans on chip manufacturing equipment to China.
Dutch ASML Holding, the global giant in lithography machines, recently issued a warning that banning the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to a rise in semiconductor prices.
According to analysis by American media, many American companies have been greatly affected after the US government implemented aggressive suppression on China's chip and semiconductor industries, including electronic design automation tool developers, chip designers, wafer manufacturing equipment manufacturers, and chip manufacturers themselves.
The so-called suppression of China's advanced semiconductor industry by the United States has dragged down the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain.
The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry that has long formed a closely connected global semiconductor industry chain.
According to professionals' estimation, based on specialized division of labor, the entire production process of semiconductor products needs to cross international borders more than 70 times, taking a total of 100 days.
Although the United States has a strong foundation in the semiconductor industry, it is relatively weak in manufacturing capabilities, especially in advanced process technology, and heavily relies on the East Asian region.
Even though the United States is making great efforts to guide the regional development of the advanced chip production supply chain towards a "small circle" dominated by the United States, it is difficult to change the regional distribution and interdependence of the global semiconductor industry.
The United States' strong "reshaping" and "de-Chinization" of the semiconductor industry has severely impacted the global semiconductor industry.
Chips are the core of the global future industry, and the development of the chip industry cannot be separated from the participation of countries around the world.
In recent years, the United States has taken a series of unilateral actions, successively issuing the "Innovation and Competition Act," the "2022 U.S. Competition Act," and the "Chip and Science Act," using technological hegemony to consolidate its own technological advantage. It has applied both rewards and coercion to allies, enticing companies such as Intel, TSMC, and Samsung to establish factories in the United States, making great efforts to ensure America's global leadership position in the chip industry.
In the short term, the United States has indeed caused trouble for China's chip industry and related industries, but has also gained tangible benefits.
However, in the long run, the hysterical suppression by the United States will continuously push China's chip industry to break through, causing itself to lose a huge Chinese market. Ultimately, it will greatly weaken the innovation willingness and capability of American technology companies and damage the development of the global chip industry.

The first batch of personal pension financial products are on sale, with a minimum holding period of only 360 days - China News Network.
The first batch of personal pension financial products are now on sale.
There are 7 products available for selection from the household institution, with a minimum holding period of only 360 days.
Personal pension financial products are finally online.
On February 10th, China Wealth Management Network released the first batch of names of individual pension financial products. ICBC Wealth Management, Agricultural Bank of China Wealth Management, and China Post Wealth Management officially launched 7 individual pension financial products.
At this point, the "shelf" of personal pension accounts has finally gathered four types of products: personal pension savings, personal pension financial management, personal pension insurance, and personal pension public funds.
According to the introduction, the first batch of personal pension financial products are all open-ended products of public offering net value type. Among them, there are 5 newly issued products and 2 existing products. Except for 1 product that is a mixed type product, the remaining 6 products are all fixed income products.
Beijing Youth Daily reporters found that out of the 5 newly issued products, 4 of them are from ICBC Wealth Management, all of which are fixed-income products with respective minimum holding periods of 365 days, 540 days, 720 days, and 1080 days. The corresponding performance benchmarks (annualized) are 3.70% - 4.20%, 4.10% - 4.60%, 4.40% - 4.90%, and 5.25% - 5.75%.
The remaining new product is "Youyin Wealth Tianti · Hongjin Shortest Holding 1095 Days No. 1", which is also a fixed-income product. It started fundraising on February 10th and ended on February 19th. The risk level is level two.
Among the two existing products, one is the Agricultural Bank of China's "Agricultural Bank of China Together · Dynamic" 360-day RMB technology innovation wealth management product, which has a mixed investment nature and a risk level of three.
Another existing product is "You Yin Cai Fu Tian Yi Hong Jin Shortest Holding 365 Days No. 1", a fixed income type. It started fundraising on December 30th last year and officially operated on January 4th this year. The cumulative net value on February 8th was 1.0011.
According to the "Opinions of the General Office of the State Council on Promoting the Development of Personal Pension Funds," the financial products that personal pension fund accounts can invest in include bank wealth management, savings deposits, commercial pension insurance, and public funds.
The first batch of personal pension financial products have been launched, marking that individual pension investors can officially purchase financial products through their personal pension fund accounts.
In November last year, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission formulated the "Interim Measures for the Management of Personal Pension Business of Commercial Banks and Wealth Management Companies".
According to the "Regulations", participants can purchase personal pension savings, personal pension financial products, personal pension insurance products, and personal pension public fund products through their personal pension fund accounts.
Subsequently, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the Ministry of Finance, and the State Administration of Taxation issued a notice, clarifying that the individual pension system will be implemented in 36 pilot cities and regions, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang in Hebei Province, Xiong'an New Area, and Jincheng City in Shanxi Province.
As of the end of 2022, the number of individuals participating in the pension scheme is 19.54 million, the number of contributors is 6.13 million, and the total amount of contributions is 14.2 billion yuan.
Previously, the participating banks only launched three types of products for personal pension savings, personal pension insurance, and personal pension public funds.
Now that individual pension financial products have also gathered together, how should investors choose?
Experts from the Industrial Bank Wealth Management Product Development Department said that compared with other personal pension products, both the pilot stage pension wealth management products and personal pension wealth management products have three characteristics.
Firstly, it is stability. The risk management mechanism is more sound, and the investment strategy and concept are more stable, and third-party independent custody is implemented for non-parent banks.
Secondly, it is long-term in nature. During the pilot phase, the term of the elderly financial products is set at 5 years or more. For the next issuance of personal pension financial products, the minimum holding period is generally 1 year, with encouragement to hold for 3 years or more.
Third, it is inclusive, with a low threshold for purchasing products, usually starting at 1 yuan, and some as low as 0.01 yuan. The custodial fees, management fees, and other rates for the products are even more favorable.
Professionals point out that investors should make their choices based on the characteristics of the product and their own risk tolerance.
Personal pension savings have the characteristics of a longer term, higher interest rates, and high security, making it suitable for individuals with a weak risk tolerance. Personal pension insurance products focus on protection and are more suitable for individuals who cannot bear investment risks but can accept stable income. Personal pension wealth management products and public fund products do not guarantee principal or income, have certain investment risks, but have higher expected returns, and are suitable for individuals with a certain financial knowledge and higher risk tolerance.

Fitness industry should overcome trust crisis - China News Network
Another large fitness center "explodes"?
Recently, the issue of member rights protection in the well-known fitness institution Zhongjian Fitness has attracted social attention.
After the Spring Festival, many members found that their stores were not operating normally. Subsequently, rumors of the institution closing down and running away caused panic among the members, leading to the intervention of the public security and human resources departments.
Finally, the relevant person in charge of the organization came forward to respond, promising to make efforts to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of employees and members, and the controversy was finally resolved.
Some individual fitness institutions have encountered operational issues in certain stores and have temporarily closed. Consumers could have calmly waited for the problem to be resolved, so why is the first reaction of many members "something is wrong"?
Behind the controversy over the rights protection of fitness club members lies a deep-rooted crisis of trust in the industry.
Traditional fitness centers in China generally adopt a prepaid model, and the underlying logic of their development is to "make money from users who do not come."
By obtaining cash flow through pre-selling membership cards and continuously opening new stores, it may seem like a cycle, but in reality, it is borrowing from the future and unable to form a stable profit model.
Negative information about industries such as fitness centers running away has been frequently reported, causing a strong impact on consumer confidence.
From the perspective of market prospects, the gym can certainly be considered a good business with "money-making potential".
Although the fitness industry has experienced ups and downs, it has always received attention from capital.
Multiple data shows that the popularity of cultural and sports consumption and other fields continues to rise, and the market continues to recover.
Specifically in the fitness market, with the steady improvement of residents' living standards and the deepening of the concept of a healthy lifestyle, the fitness industry has great potential for development.
The better the situation becomes, the more the industry needs to pay attention to the quality of development.
However, some institutions are blindly optimistic about the fitness market after the recovery of consumption. Just as they have just emerged from the crisis, they have sounded the horn of expanding territory and invested all their financing funds in the construction of new stores.
Undeniably, in recent years, many institutions have withdrawn due to the impact of the epidemic, leading to a reshuffling of the industry. At this time, powerful companies are selectively increasing their acquisition efforts and reorganizing, which can be seen as a new opportunity.
However, in order for the fitness market to develop and enter a virtuous cycle, and to embark on a steady and prosperous path, the industry must change its traditional model and alter its business strategies.
Only by steadily rebuilding consumer trust and sense of security can we truly win the market and win the future.
Compared to aggressively opening new stores to seize the market, what the fitness industry currently needs is to calm down and optimize services, and stabilize users through high-quality development.
Firstly, it is necessary to retain users through service.
The gym belongs to the service industry, and its essence is to adhere to "user orientation". It is important to closely focus on user needs and prioritize improving service quality in business operations.
Secondly, it is necessary to enhance user experience through digital transformation.
For example, the current popular internet fitness studio model allows users to pay per session and choose their own location.
At the same time, body data and exercise data can be effectively utilized, and social needs can also be met, achieving a complete service loop from online to offline.
Without personal trainer sales, without huge annual cards, users' concerns about fitness institutions "running away" have decreased, and trust has also increased.
In addition, we should actively explore diverse business formats.
Nowadays, sports consumption has shifted from single services to scene consumption. Fitness clubs are expected to become a new entry point for consumption, and peripheral products such as sports supplements and fitness equipment needed for fitness may become new profit points, providing consumers with more diverse choices.

Buy expensive and return the price difference!
"Nanjing real estate market sees the return of 'price difference compensation' - China News"
Yangzi Evening News (Reporter Ma Zuobo) Yangzi Evening News/Zi Niu News reporter found in an interview on the 10th that the long-lost "price guarantee agreement" has returned to the Nanjing real estate market. A real estate project in Jiangbei New District claims "compensation for price difference", offering greater discounts on other housing units before delivery than previous discounts. The developer is willing to exchange the purchased unit and refund the price difference to the buyer.
"Price guarantee agreement" conditions can be quite a few.
The property located in Jiangbei New District is named Poly Yangzi Cuiyuntai. Mr. Sun, a visitor to the property, told the reporter that he discovered a "statement" while visiting the property last weekend.
The pictures he sent to the journalist show that the developer of the property promises that for those who purchase housing between February 1st and February 28th, from the date of signing the sales contract to the delivery of the corresponding housing, if the discount for other properties in the project is greater than the discount enjoyed by the previous buyer (limited to unsold properties of the same layout, same building, same unit, and same property type as the property being purchased), the developer can exchange the property for the buyer and refund the price difference.
Mr. Sun said that the property consultant actually referred to this as a "price guarantee agreement" in order to reassure buyers and alleviate concerns about the developer lowering prices for promotion. "Now the worry is that once we buy it, the price might drop. We don't have time to cause a scene at the sales office, but it really bothers us if we don't."
Many home buyers also believe that the "price protection agreement" is indeed a reassurance for buyers, but the conditions are not low.
Ms. Zheng, who plans to buy an affordable housing unit in Jiangbei, said that the first requirement for a price-guaranteed property is that it must be of the same layout. It also needs to be in the same building and the same unit. There are very few properties that buyers can compare prices with, so the "threshold" is quite high.
Some home buyers also believe that due to information asymmetry, sellers may offer additional discounts during the sales process, making it difficult for buyers to exercise their rights.
It remains to be seen whether homebuyers can be retained.
According to a journalist's online real estate search in Nanjing, it was found that this development obtained sales permits for a total of 252 units in two buildings in November last year. The unit sizes include 105 square meters, 114 square meters, 129 square meters, etc., and the average selling price for fully furnished units is 39,843 yuan per square meter.
However, more than two months have passed, and the online real estate shows that the total number of unsold units in this development is 157, accounting for 62.3%. Among them, Building 8 has a total of 128 units, with 113 units unsold. Out of the 124 units in Building 7, 44 units are also unsold. The total number of transactions for the project is only 33 units, accounting for only 13%.
Market insiders introduced that the "price guarantee agreement" also appeared in Nanjing in 2008.
In August of that year, the real estate development Hengtangxiyuan on Huangshan Road in Hexi launched a "Price Protection Plan" in order to attract potential buyers. The specific content of the plan was that "the company solemnly promises that if the discount for the project expands within one year, the company will refund the difference to the existing homeowners."
After April 2011, there were also 9 real estate projects in Nanjing that promised to compensate for price differences by offering some of their housing units.
"The real estate market is recovering, and now it needs a 'stimulant' more than ever."
"Nanjing real estate industry veteran trader Mr. Shen said that the 'price protection agreement' is also one of the marketing methods used by real estate companies."
He believes that nowadays, development companies need confidence more than homebuyers. Introducing the "price guarantee agreement" is actually a way to boost their morale.
As for whether the homebuyers can be retained, he said it depends on the impact of multiple factors such as regulation policies and loan thresholds. It is still to be observed at present.
Multiple data decline, Taiwan's economy starts the year with poor performance - China News Network
Xinhua News Agency Taipei, February 11th (Reporters Zhao Bo and Huang Yang) The export trade volume has been declining for five consecutive months, the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the manufacturing industry has been contracting for seven consecutive months, and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has exceeded 300 again... Recently, the Taiwan authorities have successively released economic data for January 2023.
Experts believe that Taiwan's economy has performed poorly at the beginning of the year and faces significant growth pressure.
According to the financial management department of the Taiwan authorities, Taiwan's exports in January this year amounted to 31.51 billion US dollars, a year-on-year decrease of 21.2%, marking the fifth consecutive month of negative growth.
The export value of 11 major export commodities has declined compared to the same period last year.
The plastic rubber and its products, as well as optical equipment, experienced the deepest decline, with a year-on-year decrease of 37.6% and 35.7% respectively.
Exports of electronic components decreased by 20.1% annually, marking the largest decline in 11 years.
Among them, integrated circuits decreased by 18.3% annually, marking the largest decline in 14 years.
The director of the statistics department, Cai Meina, said that this shows the weak diffusion effect of consumer electronics industry demand, and the electronics industry has entered a correction period.
Statistics show that Taiwan's imports and exports in January decreased, with a trade surplus of only 2.34 billion US dollars, reaching the lowest level in nearly three years.
The financial affairs department of the Taiwan authorities believes that global terminal demand has decreased, and the adjustment of inventory in the industry has suppressed manufacturers' willingness to purchase materials. The short-term improvement in export decline is difficult to see, and Taiwan's export decline in the first quarter of this year is expected to be higher than expected.
According to the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, the seasonally adjusted Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for Taiwan's manufacturing industry in January this year was 40.4%, a decrease of 3.3 percentage points from December last year, marking the seventh consecutive month of contraction.
In the economic monitoring indicator system, PMI takes 50% as the dividing line. If the index is greater than 50%, it represents economic expansion, otherwise it indicates contraction.
In January, the five components of Taiwan's PMI index showed that new orders, production, and employment contracted, while supplier delivery time decreased and inventory tightened.
All six industries have seen a contraction in PMI, with the industries ranked in order of contraction speed as follows: the power and machinery equipment industry (35.1%), the electronics and optics industry (35.2%), the chemical and biotechnology medical industry (39.2%), the basic raw materials industry (42.4%), the transportation industry (42.6%), and the food and textile industry (45.7%).
In terms of prices, the "Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics" of the Taiwan authorities announced that the year-on-year CPI growth rate in Taiwan in January this year was 3.04%, once again surpassing 3% since July last year.
Among them, vegetable prices soared by 28.25%, reaching a 17-month high.
Cao Zhihong, a special commissioner from the "General Administration of Statistics of Taiwan," frankly admitted that the increase in vegetable prices has indeed exceeded expectations. Excluding the factor of the Spring Festival, the average CPI for January and February this year should be close to the 2.71% in December last year. Inflationary pressure still exists and remains high.
Looking ahead to Taiwan's economy this year, according to reports from various local media outlets such as "United Daily News" and "Yahoo Finance," experts express pessimism.
Professor Wu Daren from the Economics Department of "Tai Zhongyang University" analyzed that the decline in exports may cause cash flow problems for export manufacturing companies and increase the risk of debt defaults.
At the same time, the decrease in orders has led manufacturers to cut labor costs, affecting the labor market and household economy, which in turn impacts consumer purchasing power.
Taiwan Institute of Economic Research researcher Qiu Dasheng believes that the inflation situation in Europe and the United States has not been resolved this year, and demand continues to shrink. It is estimated that Taiwan's export decline will continue into the first half of the year.
Due to Taiwan's economy relying on exports for support, the overall economic growth performance for the year will not be as good as last year due to the impact of sluggish exports.
"Key Engine for Global Recovery" - China News Network
"In response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese economy has demonstrated strong resilience."
Recent market expectations indicate that the international community generally has a positive outlook on China's future development.
"Hulio Rios, a well-known Chinese expert on China issues and honorary advisor to China Policy Observer, recently stated in an interview with our reporter that the current stage of epidemic prevention and control in China has entered a new phase, and the vitality of economic and social development will be further unleashed."
Rios expressed that in the face of various unexpected factors, China has calmly responded with extraordinary economic governance experience and measures, fully demonstrating its economic resilience and management level.
China is steadfast in expanding its opening-up to the outside world, while the internal driving force for economic development continues to strengthen, and state-owned enterprises and private enterprises develop in synergy.
Every year, the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference are held in China, where representatives and members discuss the overall development of the country and address key issues concerning people's livelihood. They extensively gather consensus, unite the people, and pool wisdom, adding strength to China's development.
"Since the reform and opening up, China has achieved long-term high-speed development and has now entered a stage of high-quality development."
The international community expects China's wisdom and solutions, and hopes that China's development will bring new opportunities to the world.
"Rios said that China is currently making full efforts to promote technological innovation and inject new momentum into economic and social development. "Capital investment, talent cultivation, and policy incentives are allowing China to continue to be vibrant in the new five-year plan."
In Li Aosi's view, economic system reform is a challenging task for any country.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, China not only leverages the strengths of a market economy but also harnesses the advantages of the socialist system, taking proactive measures to stabilize the economy.
Focusing on expanding domestic demand as the strategic foundation, increasing financial support for the real economy, supporting the development of private enterprises, small and medium-sized enterprises, and the manufacturing industry, adhering to innovative development, promoting employment, improving the income and living standards of the Chinese people, and meeting the diverse consumption needs of the people... China fully, accurately, and comprehensively implements the new development concept, strives to promote high-quality development, and build a new development pattern, which will bring more growth opportunities to the world.
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the proposal of the "Belt and Road" initiative.
"The common goal of the international community is to stabilize and revive the economy after the epidemic."
The potential of China's economic development continues to be unleashed, which will bring more benefits to countries around the world and become an important engine for global recovery.
"Li Aosi expressed his expectation for the continued role of the Belt and Road cooperation in improving the infrastructure level of various countries and enhancing interconnectivity in various fields, and continuing to unleash greater potential."

Save half or even more on expenses?
Henan Province standardizes and integrates the prices of oral implant medical services - China News Network
CCTV News: Dental implantation is the ideal choice for many patients with missing teeth, but the high price of tens of thousands of yuan per tooth has deterred many patients.
Since the beginning of this year, with the accelerated implementation of collective procurement of dental implants, dental implant prices have also been put on the agenda in various regions.
Starting from February 10th, the comprehensive price regulation target for regular single-tooth dental implant medical services in Henan Province is 4300 yuan, and the comprehensive cost of a single regular dental implant procedure does not exceed 97% of the regulation target.
Dental implant refers to a method of tooth restoration that uses the lower structure implanted into the bone tissue as a foundation to support and fix the upper dental prosthesis for missing teeth.
Reporters learned from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University that, taking a single conventional implant as an example, the price from implantation to final restoration is approximately 16,000 to 17,000 yuan.
Patient He Ying: After the new policy, the doctor told me that for someone like me, the cost would be around 8,000 to just under 10,000 yuan, which is basically half of what it used to be.
Based on the current projects, Henan Province has also integrated and determined 15 oral implant medical service price items such as "planting body implantation fee (per unit)", and uniformly formulated the price and medical insurance payment categories for provincially managed public medical institutions, and cancelled or adjusted 20 medical service price items such as dental implant surgery.
Zhengzhou Medical Security Bureau's Director of Pharmaceutical Pricing and Tender Procurement Department, Li Yunjie: The main beneficiaries are four parties. Firstly, medical insurance, as its expenses have decreased. Secondly, hospitals have less financial burden, which may lead to an increase in the number of patients. Thirdly, suppliers have gained access to a new market. Lastly, the patients themselves benefit the most, as the cost of dental implants may be reduced by half or even more.

The Chinese e-commerce industry is experiencing "new variables", how can we achieve "content is king" in product promotion?
-China News Network
Xinhua News, February 11th - Title: "Emerging "New Variables" in China's E-commerce Industry, How to Achieve "Content is King" in Product Promotion?"
China News Finance reporter Xia Bin
"We entered the e-commerce game relatively late, but from the very beginning, we realized that in order to stand out among the millions of stores, content is crucial."
Fangfang, a "post-90s" girl from Guangdong, is currently operating a health food store on Douyin, allowing an offline store with over 30 years of history to "blossom" online.
Imitating the style of old Hong Kong films and accompanied by classic Cantonese songs, opening @Fang Fang's solo dining TikTok account, the exquisite videos are refreshing to the eyes and ears.
At the recent Douyin e-commerce "Finding Partners·Quality Content Sharing Session", Fang Fang, as a representative of high-quality creators, attended and gave a speech, introducing her experience and insights in daily creation.
She said on the scene, "The carefully crafted video has gained a lot of attention from netizens. Many people are interested in the ingredients in my home and want to cook together. The sales have suddenly opened up."
"
Fang Fang relies on soup cooking videos to make more people fall in love with the "taste of old Guangzhou". In one live broadcast, she sold up to 300,000 pieces of nourishing ingredients, saving her family's struggling old store from closing down.
"No content, no e-commerce." With the continuous development of short videos and live-streaming e-commerce, people's requirements and standards for e-commerce content are entering a new stage.
In the early stages of live-streaming e-commerce, live-streaming rooms often attracted users with low-price discounts, and price advantage seemed to be the only selling point at that time.
In recent years, there have been both phenomenon-level influencers like Liu Genghong and Dongfang Zhenxuan, as well as many unknown experts and businesses that have emerged in vertical niche fields. They have been continuously creating high-quality content that aligns with their brand identity, thereby enhancing long-term business effectiveness.
Gao Yaxuan, the head of operations for Douyin e-commerce, introduced that in the past year, 6.27 million creators have monetized their content through Douyin e-commerce. Their content creation has increased by 252%, and the total transaction volume has more than doubled.
"Behind these numbers, we can feel a thriving and vibrant author ecosystem."
"Gao Yaxuan said."
Beijing Normal University's Communication Innovation and Future Media Experimental Platform previously released the "E-commerce Industry Content Ecology Health Index (ECHI) Report", which analyzed the importance of "new variables" - high-quality content in the current e-commerce industry from a data perspective, and evaluated the content ecology of 27 mainstream domestic e-commerce platforms using the index.
According to the ranking of the E-commerce Industry Content Ecology Health Index in the above-mentioned report, Douyin E-commerce, Kuaishou, Taobao, Pinduoduo, and JD.com are among the top five.
The report believes that the content ecology of the e-commerce industry is a comprehensive concept that integrates e-commerce with content. However, not all content can be integrated with e-commerce. Good PGC (professionally produced content) and UGC (user-generated content) are the high-quality carriers for integrating with e-commerce. The higher the value of the content platform, the more diverse the scenes for consumption and promotion, and the higher the possibility of e-commerce integration. The stronger the commercial value, the higher the proportion of e-commerce content production and consumption that gradually integrates and distributes in the public and private domains.
On-site, Professor Yu Guoming, from the School of Journalism and Communication at Beijing Normal University and Chairman of the Professional Committee of Media Economy and Management in China, provided an analysis and interpretation of the "report".
He expressed that in terms of content value, the current e-commerce industry has transitioned from the stage of "consumption accessibility" to the stage of "consumption quality". High-quality, professional, and differentiated content is the "hard currency" of the e-commerce industry.
At the same time, content has become the foundation and key point of the new stage of e-commerce development. Paid knowledge, professional knowledge, and Key Opinion Leaders (KOL) have become standard in e-commerce live streaming.
Looking forward to the future development of the e-commerce industry, Yu Guoming puts forward two suggestions.
From the perspective of improving content structure, it aims to promote the overall improvement of the health and quality of e-commerce content ecology, establish positive standards for content creation and management, and achieve a balanced index and dynamics of the health system of the e-commerce industry's content ecology.
Another aspect is to look at the content e-commerce industry from an external ecological perspective, in order to achieve the healthy development of the industry and the value synergy and co-creation with the external environment.
"The future e-commerce industry still needs more support in terms of data and artificial intelligence, in order to form predictions for the stability of future development. In addition, it is necessary to provide businesses with a more standardized and healthy growth space, to achieve value synergy among enterprises, users, products, and services in the e-commerce industry, and to create a healthy content ecosystem."

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 11th - Title: Advancing Chinese-style modernization is a systematic project - Four points on deeply understanding General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the opening ceremony of the seminar on studying and implementing the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.
Xinhua News Agency commentator
"Advancing Chinese-style modernization is a systematic project that requires overall consideration, systematic planning, and comprehensive promotion. It is necessary to correctly handle a series of major relationships, such as top-level design and practical exploration, strategy and tactics, adherence to principles and innovation, efficiency and fairness, vitality and order, self-reliance and self-improvement, and openness to the outside world."
"At the opening ceremony of the seminar on studying and implementing Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, attended by newly elected members and alternate members of the Central Committee, as well as senior leaders at the provincial and ministerial levels, General Secretary Xi Jinping scientifically grasped the laws of modernization construction, and deeply and systematically elucidated a series of major relationships that need to be handled well in practice, providing us with a scientific methodology for vigorously promoting the Chinese-style modernization."
Advancing Chinese-style modernization involves various fields such as the economy, politics, culture, society, and ecological civilization. It is related to governing the party, the country, and the military, as well as internal affairs, diplomacy, and national defense. It requires both systematic planning and the courage to reform and innovate, continuously achieving overall progress.
To carry out top-level design, it is necessary to have a profound understanding of the global development trend, accurately grasp the common aspirations of the people, deeply explore the laws of economic and social development, and ensure that the formulated planning and policy system reflect the characteristics of the times, grasp the regularities, and are rich in creativity. It is important to achieve a combination of long-term and short-term goals, coherence between different levels, and coordination of content.
Advancing Chinese-style modernization is an exploratory endeavor that involves many unknown areas. It requires bold exploration in practice and the promotion of development through reform and innovation. We must not cling to outdated methods or wait for opportunities to come to us.
Strategic issues are fundamental issues for a political party and a country.
To promote the modernization of China, we need to enhance the forward-looking nature of our strategy, using scientific strategic foresight to anticipate and lead the future. We need to strengthen the comprehensiveness of our strategy, focusing on resolving major issues that are crucial to the success or failure of the Party and the country, and have far-reaching implications. We also need to enhance the stability of our strategy, once a strategy is formed, we must adhere to it for the long term, persevere until the end, and achieve success.
To scientifically grasp the dialectical unity between strategy and tactics, we must organically combine the principled nature of strategy with the flexibility of tactics. We should be flexible and agile, adapt to changing circumstances, make decisions on the spot, and take the initiative in strategy by adapting to local conditions, responding to the situation, and seizing opportunities.
The Chinese nation is a nation that upholds righteousness and innovation.
Handle the relationship between adhering to tradition and innovation well. We must adhere to the essence, origin, roots, and soul of Chinese-style modernization, unwaveringly adhere to the Chinese characteristics, essential requirements, and major principles of Chinese-style modernization, ensure the correct direction of Chinese-style modernization, and prioritize innovation in the overall development of the country. We must adapt to the requirements of the times, focus on solving major theoretical and practical problems, actively respond to changes, vigorously promote reform and innovation, continuously shape new driving forces and advantages for development, and fully stimulate the creative vitality of the whole society.
Efficiency is an important foundation for fairness, and fairness is a strong guarantee for efficiency.
We are promoting the Chinese-style modernization, which aims to not only create higher efficiency than capitalism but also effectively maintain social fairness, and better achieve a balance, promotion, and unity between efficiency and fairness.
Handle the relationship between efficiency and fairness well, continuously achieve development for the people, rely on the people for development, and share the fruits of development with the people, so that the achievements of modernization can benefit all the people more and more fairly.
To promote the modernization with Chinese characteristics, it is necessary to handle the relationship between vitality and order, so as to make the society both vibrant and stable.
We must coordinate the development and security, implement the overall national security concept, improve the national security system, enhance the ability to safeguard national security, and firmly safeguard national political security, institutional security, ideological security, and security in key areas.
Both in the process of development, more consideration is given to security factors, by developing and enhancing national security capabilities, using the achievements of development to consolidate the foundation of national security, and also adept at creating a secure environment conducive to economic and social development, constantly stimulating development vitality, achieving a benign interaction between high-quality development and high-level security.
Promoting Chinese-style modernization requires both adhering to our own path and expanding our global perspective. We must persist in opening up to the outside world and continuously broaden the breadth and depth of Chinese-style modernization.
We must adhere to independence and self-reliance, self-reliance and self-improvement. We must place the development of our country and nation on the basis of our own strength, and firmly grasp the destiny of our country's development and progress in our own hands.
We must continuously expand high-level opening up to the outside world, deeply participate in global industrial division and cooperation, make good use of both domestic and international resources, expand the development space of Chinese-style modernization, and share development opportunities and create a better future through mutual benefit and win-win cooperation.
To follow the right path is the key to success.
Let us, under the strong leadership of Comrade Xi Jinping as the core of the Party Central Committee, and guided by Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era, grasp the laws, be diligent in practice, fully exert our enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity, correctly handle a series of major relationships, and strive to make progress in the new journey of building a socialist modernized country, continuously opening up new frontiers for Chinese-style modernization.
(German Voice Chinese Website) The Biden administration will blacklist six Chinese entities suspected of involvement in the spy balloon program this Friday (February 10th).
The US Department of Commerce stated that these 5 Chinese companies and 1 research institution are assisting in the modernization of the Chinese military, particularly in aerospace projects, including airships and aircraft.
Companies that are blacklisted have a hard time obtaining technology exports from the United States.
The list is called the "Entity List". Companies on the list will be unable to purchase technology or goods from US suppliers unless they obtain a special export license from the US Department of Commerce.
The companies that have been blacklisted are: Beijing Nanjiang Aerospace Technology Co., Ltd., China Electronics Technology Group Corporation No. 48 Research Institute, Dongguan Lingkong Remote Sensing Technology Co., Ltd., Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd., Guangzhou Tianhai Xiang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd., and Shanxi Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd.
Before this, the White House expressed consideration of taking broader measures to "expose and address" larger-scale surveillance activities by China that threaten US national security.
The balloon incident has further escalated tensions between China and the United States, leading to the cancellation of Secretary of State Blinken's visit to China.
On February 4th, the United States shot down a balloon. The Chinese government lodged a solemn representation with the US Embassy in China, criticizing the United States for seriously undermining and damaging the efforts and progress in maintaining stable China-US relations.
Based on the existing wreckage evidence and information from China's military procurement platform, the US government has concluded that the manufacturer of this balloon has "direct ties with the Chinese Liberation Army" and is an approved supplier by the Chinese military.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning stated at a press conference on Friday that regarding the unexpected incident of a Chinese unmanned airship mistakenly entering US airspace due to force majeure, the Chinese side has already explained the situation and clarified its position multiple times.
According to the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, she further added that the relevant resolution passed by the US Congress is purely political manipulation and sensationalism.
The Chinese side strongly expresses its dissatisfaction and firmly opposes this.
Matthew Axelrod, Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement at the US Department of Commerce, stated: "Today's actions demonstrate our joint efforts to identify and prevent China's use of spy balloons, which violate the airspace of the United States and over 40 other countries."
"
Reuters reported that an employee of Guangzhou Tianhai Xiang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd. stated that they were unaware of the sanctions and declined to comment further.
The Chinese Embassy in the United States has not yet commented on this information.

(German Voice Chinese Website) Several days have passed since the earthquake occurred in parts of Turkey and Syria, and the hope of finding survivors is gradually diminishing. However, the rescue of a family of five on Saturday has brought immense joy to the search and rescue personnel.
According to the Associated Press, in the heavily affected area of Nurdağı town in Gaziantep province, this family of five was successfully rescued after being trapped under the rubble for more than five days.
The rescue team first pulled the mother and daughter out of a pile of rubble, and then found the father, but he insisted on saving his son and another daughter first.
When they were all saved, cheers erupted from the crowd.
In the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaraş, under harsh and freezing weather conditions, a 16-year-old boy and a 70-year-old woman were also successfully rescued.
"What day is it today?"
"After being brought back to the surface, the boy who was trapped under the ruins for 129 hours asked the rescuers who saved him."
A man from Kahramanmaraş is holding the cat he just rescued.
The miraculous successful rescue case has brought a glimmer of hope to the originally bleak search and rescue work, but at the same time, the number of casualties continues to rise.
According to official statistics, the earthquake on Monday has already caused over 20,000 deaths in Turkey, with an estimated death toll of over 3,500 in neighboring Syria.
Although experts have stated that a person can survive for more than a week after being trapped in ruins, the hope of finding more survivors has become increasingly slim.
Rescue personnel are still using thermal imaging cameras to search for signs of life beneath the ruins.
At the same time, the focus of the rescue work begins to shift towards helping those survivors who are in urgent need of assistance.
UN official: "A once-in-a-century disaster in the region"
Martin Griffiths, the United Nations Deputy Secretary-General and Emergency Relief Coordinator in charge of humanitarian affairs, stated at a press conference held in Turkey that this earthquake is the "worst disaster in the region in a century."
He also praised Turkey's response actions after the disaster as "extraordinary".
He also told Reuters reporters that he hopes to provide rescue assistance to areas controlled by both the Syrian government and the opposition, but also stated that the relevant matters are "still unclear".
The United Nations has pledged to provide an additional $25 million in relief donations to the earthquake-stricken population in Syria.
Earlier this week, the United Nations announced a grant of $25 million for humanitarian aid in Turkey and Syria.

A total of 14 countries along the Pacific coast were affected, with the most severely affected areas including Aceh Province in Indonesia, Khao Lak and Phuket in Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Tamil Nadu in India.
At that time, it was the peak tourist season during Christmas. The disaster-stricken areas were crowded with a large number of tourists and local residents, causing many holidaymakers enjoying their vacation on the beach and locals working by the seaside to be swept away by the tsunami, resulting in a significant number of people becoming missing in this earthquake.
According to estimates, the number of casualties and missing persons is at least 300,000.
The most destructive earthquake that has occurred globally in the past 60 years.
Wenchuan Earthquake (2008)

This accident has been classified as the most severe level 7 in the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale (INES).
The Fukushima nuclear accident resulted in trace amounts of radioactive substances being detected worldwide, including iodine-131 and cesium-137 (with a half-life of 30 years).
A large amount of radioactive isotopes were released into the Pacific Ocean as a result of the nuclear accident.
According to statistics from the United Nations, there are currently at least 870,000 people in the disaster areas of Turkey and Syria who urgently need food.
In Syria alone, as many as 5.3 million people have lost their homes due to earthquakes.
The World Food Programme (WFP) is calling for a funding of 77 million US dollars to provide food for the displaced refugees in Turkey and Syria due to the earthquake.
Currently, the temperature in the disaster area is below zero, and many victims have no place to live.
The Turkish government has distributed a large number of hot meals, tents, and blankets, but these supplies are still difficult to reach many people in need of assistance.
And in war-torn Syria, which has been trapped in a civil war for 12 long years, the earthquake only adds to the suffering of the people.
Within four days after the earthquake, the World Food Programme has provided food relief to 115,000 people in Turkey and Syria.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has sent 72 tons of medical supplies for trauma treatment and emergency surgery.

Google AI chatbot "answers wrong questions", parent company's stock price evaporates $100 billion.
(11th Day News)
Google's newly launched AI chatbot Bard got off to a bad start as it "answered questions incorrectly" in its promotional video, causing Google's parent company Alphabet's stock price to plummet by 8.9% on Wednesday, falling below the $100 mark. The market value evaporated by $110 billion (approximately 476.5 billion Malaysian Ringgit), closing at $94.57 per share by the end of Friday's trading session.
The market is worried that Alphabet is not as competitive as its rival Microsoft.
According to Reuters, Google previously released a promotional video of its AI chatbot Bard on social media. In the video, someone asked Bard, "What new discoveries about the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) can I tell my 9-year-old child?"
"Bard mentioned in his response that the telescope had captured the first photograph of an exoplanet outside of our solar system."
However, according to data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States, the first photograph of an exoplanet was taken by the European Southern Observatory's "Very Large Telescope" in 2004.
"Reuters" reported with the headline "Alphabet's stock price plummets after Bard's incorrect response."
On the other hand, Google pointed out that Bard's response "highlights the importance of rigorous testing processes" and will combine external feedback with its own internal testing to ensure that Bard's response "meets high standards based on quality, safety, and accurate information."

Tourist arrivals have now recovered to 33% of the pre-pandemic level.
From January to September 2022, Singapore's tourism revenue totaled SGD 8.96 billion. It is estimated that the total tourism revenue for the whole year of 2022 could reach SGD 13.8 billion to SGD 14.3 billion, which is 6 to 7 times higher than the SGD 1.89 billion in 2021, and has already recovered to about 50% to 52% of the pre-COVID-19 level in 2019.
The Singapore government has taken multiple measures to accelerate the recovery of the tourism industry.
In April 2022, the government announced an allocation of nearly 500 million new yuan to stimulate the recovery of the tourism industry.
The tourism bureau recently announced plans to allocate 110 million new yuan from this budget over the next two years to launch more commercial and leisure activities to attract tourists back.
In order to make health and wellness tourism one of Singapore's highlights, the Singapore Tourism Board launched an intention collection activity on November 23, 2022, planning to develop a health and wellness destination on the southern coast of Singapore.
Wang Lingli, Director of the Sports and Wellness Tourism Executive Agency of the Singapore Tourism Board, said that in recent years, more and more tourists have been prioritizing their physical health in their considerations.
Developing a health and wellness destination in the southern coastal area of Singapore, which includes Gardens by the Bay and the Marina Barrage, is expected to contribute to Singapore's tourism industry and economy, allowing visitors to spend more time and money in Singapore.
Singapore Tourism Board Director Chen Jianlong said that in the coming years, health and wellness will become an important component of Singapore's tourism products.
The COVID-19 pandemic has increased public awareness and demand for physical and mental health.
For this reason, the tourism bureau has been promoting health and wellness programs to the local public and international tourists for the past two years.
In June 2022, the Singapore Tourism Board organized the first Health and Wellness Festival, providing the public with over 130 different types of health activities and experiences.
Singapore will continue to provide new travel experiences for tourists.
In addition to the newly opened Singapore Children's Museum, the Avatar World at Gardens by the Bay, the Central Beach Market at Sentosa, and the "Exploring New Territories" exhibition at the ArtScience Museum, as well as the newly built open-air theater at the Night Safari, the Tourism Bureau will support the development and renovation of projects such as the Bird Park at the Wildlife Reserves Singapore, making Singapore an attractive international travel destination.
According to the plan, Singapore will formulate industry standards for the sustainable development of the conference, exhibition, and incentive tourism industry within the year of 2023, with a focus on improving waste management and carbon emissions, further optimizing the tourism environment.
The recovery of Singapore's tourism industry has accelerated the recovery of the aviation industry.
According to the data, as of December 18, 2022, Changi Airport has seen a strong recovery in passenger traffic, with a daily reception of up to 150,000 passengers and a weekly reception of approximately 1 million passengers, equivalent to about 75% of the pre-COVID-19 pandemic level. The number of aviation industry employees on duty has also recovered to about 90% of the pre-pandemic level.
According to the data, Singapore has received 23.6 million visitors from January to October 2022, which is equivalent to 42% of the pre-COVID-19 pandemic level. There have been 170,000 flight takeoffs and landings, which is 53% of the pre-pandemic level.
The rapid recovery of the tourism industry has also driven the recovery pace of industries such as accommodation, transportation, catering, and shopping.
The Singapore government and tourism industry have high hopes for the Chinese market.
Koh Sook Dan, Assistant Director of the International Department of the Singapore Tourism Board, said that a survey conducted by Chinese travel platforms showed that Singapore's safety index ranks among the top three globally, which is one of the reasons why Singapore is highly favored by Chinese tourists.
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 3.6 million people from China traveled to Singapore for vacation each year.
With China relaxing its border policies, it is expected that the number of Chinese tourists this year will recover to 30% to 60% of the level in 2019.
Ke Shudan pointed out that in the future, the Tourism Bureau will closely monitor the signals of further relaxation of China's outbound travel policies in order to respond to changes in tourist demand.
In addition to strengthening partnerships with Chinese online travel platforms and travel agencies such as Ctrip, the Singapore Tourism Board will actively prepare to receive Chinese tourists in response to new trends in outbound travel from China.
Looking ahead to the tourism market in 2023, the Singapore Tourism Board is confident that as long as there is no significant economic recession affecting public income and no new large-scale deadly epidemic outbreaks, the pace of recovery in the tourism industry will be faster than expected.
Kim Jong-un and his daughter have a close interaction, while his wife is left aside and ignored.
(Comprehensive 11th News) North Korea held a military parade on the evening of the 8th to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of the army. Kim Jong-un's daughter, Kim Ju-ae, not only attended the event but also stood on the podium with her father.
North Korean state media released a video on the 9th, showing Kim Jong-un's sister, Kim Yo-jong, affectionately leaning against her father. They exchanged warm glances and whispered to each other several times. She gently held her father's cheeks with both hands and even touched his chest. The father-daughter interaction was broadcasted nationwide.
However, the First Lady Li Xuezhu could only step aside.
According to reports from various sources including "Chosun News," Kim Jong-un and Ri Sol-ju attended a formal dinner on the 7th with their daughter, Kim Ju-ae. In the official group photo, Kim Ju-ae was not only seen sitting in the center between her parents, which is rare, but she also accompanied Kim Jong-un on the podium during the 75th-anniversary military parade held the following evening.
North Korean state media "Korean Central Television" released a video of the military parade afterwards, revealing more touching moments between father and daughter.
Kim Jong-un and his daughter exchanged glances several times on the podium, their smiles never fading from their faces. They also whispered to each other in each other's ears. Kim Jong-un lovingly held his father's cheeks with both hands, and Kim Jong-un responded with a radiant smile.
Other official media footage also shows that when the benefactor and Kim Jong-un sit on the indoor sofa chair, she constantly touches her father's face with her hand; when she walks hand in hand with her father, she also touches Kim Jong-un's chest with her hand.
And the First Lady Li Xuezhu could only walk behind or sit aside throughout the entire journey, always a few steps behind her husband and daughter.
South Korean media pointed out that since the Mars 17 missile was first publicly revealed on November 18th last year, the probability of exposure has been increasing in the past three months, and it has now appeared for the fifth time in formal occasions.
North Korean official media mentioned that Kim Jong-un used the highest honorific titles such as "dear son" and "honorable son" when referring to Kim Jong-il. They also broadcasted footage of Kim Jong-un shouting repeatedly from the stands, pledging unwavering support for the bloodline of the supreme leader during a military parade.
These signs have led the outside world to suspect whether the love of the main sponsor has already been designated as the successor of the Kim regime. The Washington Post analysis believes that "this is a signal from Kim Jong-un to push his middle school-aged daughter into the position of successor." However, there are also opinions that such judgments are still premature, as there are still various possibilities with the existence of a son under Kim Jong-un.
Chongyang Q&A | How to view the US January non-farm payroll data greatly exceeding expectations and future trends - Economic Observer Network - Professional financial news website.
Q: How does Zhongyang Investment view the significantly better-than-expected US non-farm payroll data for January and future trends?
A: On February 3, the US Department of Labor released the non-farm employment data for January 2023. The number of new non-farm jobs increased by 517,000, significantly higher than the market's expectation of 189,000. The unemployment rate dropped to 3.4%, the lowest level in nearly 50 years. The year-on-year growth rate of hourly wages was 4.4%, with a month-on-month growth rate of 0.3%, showing a slight slowdown.
From a total perspective, there are many one-time and technical disturbances in this data, such as the return of striking teachers and staff, revisions to the investigation and statistical calibrations, and updates to seasonal adjustment factors. There may be subsequent revisions (referring to the downward revision of non-farm employment from 504,000 to 364,000 in January 2022), and non-farm employment may not be as strong as the data suggests.
From a structural perspective, the impact of layoffs in high-tech companies is still present, but the proportion is relatively low; high-contact service industries such as leisure hotels, education, and healthcare have seen a significant rebound in new employment, and data shows that there is still a labor shortage in the service industry.
Combining the strong rebound in the service industry PMI, job vacancies, and labor shortage data, as well as the strong consumer credit data, we conclude that the US service industry has experienced rapid recovery after extreme weather and holidays.
We believe that it is difficult to improve the supply and demand tension in the US job market without going through a recession.
Currently, there is still a labor supply gap of over 5 million in the US labor market, and the labor participation rate is increasing slowly, especially the labor participation rate for the age group of 25-54 has already reached close to pre-pandemic levels.
In addition, due to the excessive savings and strong consumption credit of American residents, the strong consumer demand will further delay the impact of tightening policies on the job market.
The continuous tight supply and demand in the US job market will be the underlying tone of the US economy in 2023.
Superimposed on the current near-end of interest rate hikes, inflation expectations have been repeatedly fluctuating. We are not optimistic about the continuous decline in wage growth.
Before the release of this data, the US stock, bond, and foreign exchange markets were overly optimistic about the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike path.
With the continuous improvement of inflation data, the Federal Reserve is simultaneously shortening the pace of interest rate hikes while maintaining a fragile balance in market inflation expectations. However, the market is turning a blind eye to the hawkish stance of the Federal Reserve, not only expecting an early end to rate hikes but also anticipating two rate cuts by the end of the year.
In a situation where the labor market supply and demand are tight and the impact of tightening policies is uncertain, we believe that the Federal Reserve's guidance on interest rate hikes at the end of the year is relatively reasonable. The adjustment of extreme market expectations and the crowding of trades may cause certain harm to the market.
However, the stubbornness of wage growth cannot change the current trend of rapid inflation decline. With the year-on-year decline in M2 data and the gradual improvement of various CPI sub-indicators, US CPI data has been rapidly declining since October. The stubbornness of wage growth will only provide support for future inflation data, and the current market expectations are difficult to refute. After the announcement of the next inflation data, the market may enter a new round of speculation.
Shanshan founder Zheng Yonggang passed away due to a sudden heart disease, he once led the transformation of China's first clothing stock - Economic Observer Network - a professional financial news website.
On February 11th, the WeChat official account of Shanshan Holdings Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Shanshan Holdings") issued an obituary. Zheng Yonggang, the founder of Shanshan Enterprises and chairman of Shanshan Holdings, passed away on February 10th, 2023, at the age of 65, due to ineffective treatment for a sudden heart disease.
In the 1980s, Zheng Yonggang served as the factory director of a state-owned cotton spinning factory. With a transfer, Zheng Yonggang became the factory director of Ningbo Yungang Clothing Factory, the predecessor of Shanshan Corporation, in 1989.
In December 2022, at the 20th China Enterprise Leaders Annual Conference and the 22nd China Enterprise Future Star Annual Conference, Zheng Yonggang stated in his speech that in the Chinese suit market of the 1990s, Shanshan brand's market share once reached 37%.
In 1996, Shanshan Co., Ltd. (600884.SH) went public, becoming the first listed company in China's clothing industry.
Just as the clothing business was booming, Shanshan Group began to transform because Zheng Yonggang realized that "once the market opens up, Chinese brands will naturally form a tiered brand market. It is unlikely that Shanshan suits will continue to lead the way and become the national clothing of the Chinese people in the long term."
In 1999, Shanshan started researching corporate transformation. Zheng Yonggang recalled that year, "We came to Shanghai to figure out what exactly to do for the transformation. We specifically sought out many experts and scholars and continuously held some Zhuge Liang meetings and virtual seminars."
Finally, we have set two major strategic directions.
The first direction is new energy and new materials, and the other one is a promising future for health.
After determining the strategic direction, Shanshan began to seek cooperation. At that time, the Anshan Thermal Energy Institute was conducting a national 863 project for supporting the Ansteel Carbon Research Institute. However, the research funding was insufficient. Therefore, Shanshan and the Anshan Thermal Energy Institute's Carbon Research Institute signed a cooperation agreement to jointly promote the industrialization of the national 863 project "intermediate phase carbon microspheres". They engaged in the research, production, and sales of negative electrode materials, aiming to achieve commercial promotion of negative electrode materials domestically.
In 2001, Shanshan Corporation achieved large-scale production of intermediate carbon microspheres, starting the process of domestic substitution and replacing Japan as the main supplier of intermediate carbon microspheres in the domestic market.
This is China's first lithium-ion battery cathode material production enterprise, achieving the localization of lithium-ion battery cathode materials.
With the rapid popularization of lithium batteries, Shanshan Corporation's lithium battery business began to gradually develop. In 2007, the lithium material business was included in Shanshan Corporation's main business, while the revenue proportion of the clothing business decreased year by year. By 2013, the revenue from Shanshan Corporation's lithium material business surpassed that of the clothing business in all aspects.
In February 2021, Shanshan Corporation successfully acquired LG Chemical's polarizer business and entered the LCD polarizer market. It also established a polarizer company called Shanjing Optoelectronics. This field has a relatively high technological content, and Shanshan's main competitors are world top 500 companies such as Samsung from South Korea, Sumitomo Chemical from Japan, and Nitto Denko from Japan.
Zheng Yonggang once shared his insights on post-investment management, "The success rate of Chinese private enterprises acquiring some high-tech companies internationally is relatively low. Why do those acquisitions fail?"
Because everyone will consider, I spent so much money, I have to send someone to manage it, this is a common behavior", however, Zheng Yonggang is different. On the day when Shanshan's acquisition was successful, Zheng Yonggang publicly announced at Shanjing Electronics that as the major shareholder of Shanshan, Shanshan decided to implement a "one enterprise, two systems" approach. Apart from Zheng Yonggang serving as the chairman, Shanshan's personnel will not be sent to Shanjing, and an authorized management approach will be adopted. The existing distribution system, corporate culture, and various management models will remain unchanged.
ICC Xinlun Information released negative electrode data for 2022, showing that Shanshan's negative electrode shipments exceeded 200,000 tons, with a year-on-year growth rate of 100% and a market share of 16%. Artificial graphite negative electrode materials topped the list in terms of shipment volume.
According to Yano Research, in the polarizing film business, Sunking Optoelectronics, a subsidiary of the company, is projected to have a global market share of 29% in 2022, and it is expected to reach 32% in 2023, maintaining its position as the global leader.
In the first three quarters of 2022, Shanshan Corporation's revenue was 15.841 billion yuan, with a net profit of 2.313 billion yuan. On February 10th, Shanshan Corporation's stock price was 19.24 yuan per share, with a total market value of 43.6 billion yuan.
On February 9th, Shanshan Corporation stated on the interactive platform that by the end of 2022, the company's effective graphite production capacity will be approximately 100,000 tons, and the graphite production capacity of the Meishan project is still ramping up.
According to Wind Information, Zheng Yonggang is still the chairman and actual controller of Shanshan Co., Ltd.
According to Tianyancha, Zheng Yonggang holds a total equity stake of 40.1% in Shanshan Holdings Limited.
The general manager of Shanshan Corporation is Li Zhihua, born in 1968. He has served as the general manager of Dongguan Shanshan Battery Materials Co., Ltd., Ningbo Shanshan New Materials Technology Co., Ltd., and Chairman of Hunan Shanshan Energy Technology Co., Ltd. He is also the vice general manager of Ningbo Shanshan Corporation.
Shanshan Corporation stated on February 10th on the investor interaction platform that there is no family relationship between the senior management of the company and the actual controlling shareholder of the company.
"Fund E-Account" is here: Authorized by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, it enables investors to collect and query all funds under their name - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website.
Economic Observer Network reporter Chen Shan: The complexity of fund purchase channels makes it difficult to collect account information.
Always forgetting the "little treasury"?
The problems of the basic people will soon be solved.
On February 10th, the China Securities Regulatory Commission announced that the "Fund E-Account" app has been launched and is undergoing public trial operation on various mobile application stores.
According to the introduction, the "Fund E-account" provides individual investors with a "one-stop" query service for public fund accounts and share information, aiming to solve the industry pain points of account forgetting and cumbersome queries for the majority of small and medium-sized investors.
According to Wind data, as of the end of 2022, there are a total of 156 domestic public fund managers, managing a fund size of approximately 26 trillion yuan; there are 167 public fund share registration institutions and 411 public fund sales institutions.
Each share registration institution has an independent account system and lacks a unified industry query channel.
Industry insiders have stated that by the end of 2021, the number of fund investors in China exceeded 720 million, which means that half of the population in the country has invested in fund products.
Previously, investors needed to inquire about their purchases through different sales institutions, but through the "Fund E-account", they can now inquire about all purchases made through various sales channels, making it clear to see their fund holdings.
What is the "Fund E-Account" app?
According to relevant documents, the "Fund E-Account" APP is a mobile application for the public fund industry portal developed and constructed by China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation Limited (ChinaClear) with the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC). It can provide investors with a one-stop query of the off-exchange holdings of public fund products in the entire market.
Investors can conveniently and quickly grasp the holdings of their off-market shares of various mutual fund products purchased through all market sales channels under different fund managers through the "Fund E-Account," thereby comprehensively improving query efficiency.
Specifically, the information that investors can access through the "Fund E-Account" includes: fund account information opened with various public fund managers in the entire market, transaction account information opened with public fund sales institutions, and the holding status of off-exchange shares of products such as publicly offered securities investment funds and collective asset management plans established by securities companies that are not subject to the limit of 200 investors.
Liu Yiqian, the head of the Shanghai Securities Fund Evaluation Research Center, told Economic Observer Network reporters that investors can use the "Fund E-Account" app to obtain comprehensive information about their holdings of over-the-counter public funds. This helps them recover "forgotten assets" and, more importantly, allows customers to have a complete collection of information on their overall fund investment situation. It helps customers to have a more timely, accurate, and complete understanding of their investment situation, thereby optimizing their fund portfolio allocation and better planning their financial arrangements.
How to register and use?
The reporter noticed that currently, the "Fund E-Account" app has been listed on mobile application stores such as Huawei, Apple, Xiaomi, OPPO, Vivo, etc. However, the app is still in the public trial phase, and registration requires filling in an invitation code. Investors can contact the fund manager of the fund they hold to obtain it.
A customer service representative from a large-scale public fund in Shanghai provided a six-digit invitation code to an Economic Observer Network journalist and said, "During the trial operation phase of the app, China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation Limited provides a certain number of invitation codes to each fund manager. When investors call to obtain them, we will provide them."
After the trial operation is completed, there will be no need for invitation codes when opening user registration.
"
The journalist registered an account and completed the inquiry based on the relevant documents for downloading and using the "Fund E-Account" on the official website of the China Securities Regulatory Commission. The entire process took only a few minutes and was divided into four main steps: user registration, real-name authentication, fund account binding, and public fund inquiry.
After completing the real-name authentication, click on the "Assets" button to bind the funds. All the fund products purchased by the journalist through various fund sales platforms are displayed in the binding options list (bindable accounts). After completing the binding, the total assets of the invested funds can be visually seen and the query function can be used.
It is worth noting that the "Fund E-account" only provides query services for investors and cannot be used for subscription, redemption, or trading.
The data date displayed on the "Fund E Account" is generally three trading days before the date (T day) when the user queries.
For example, if you open a "Fund E Account" on February 10th, the total assets, fund shares, and fund net value displayed on the asset page correspond to the date three trading days prior to that date, which is February 7th.

United States, Japan, and the Philippines reach a defense consensus in jointly resisting the Chinese Communist Party.
Asia - On February 9th, Philippine President Bongbong Marcos visited Japan and held talks with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.
Both sides have reached a consensus on opposing the Chinese Communist Party's infringement in the South China Sea and East China Sea. The leaders of the Philippines and Japan issued a joint statement after the meeting, stating that they will sign a trilateral defense agreement with the United States and engage in substantive defense exchanges to counter China's hegemonic policies.
According to Japanese media, Fumio Kishida hopes to help Japan and the Philippines establish policies to address the Taiwan Strait crisis through this meeting.
Xiao Ma visited China in early January this year and obtained agreements worth 20 billion US dollars.
But after this, the relationship between China and the Philippines not only did not improve, but instead declined.
At the beginning of this month, the Philippines and the United States signed an agreement to open more bases to the US military, ensuring security in the South China Sea.
The newly added base is 300 kilometers away from Taiwan and is also the closest location to China.
If Taiwan faces a crisis, the US military may take action from its bases in the Philippines.
Japanese media believe that currently, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, and even the Philippines have formed an axis with the United States, constructing a "counter-China arc" in the Western Pacific to promote regional cooperation.
KMT Vice Chairman Xia Liyan visited China and conveyed Song Tao's message: Welcome the DPP's visit to the mainland under the 1992 Consensus.
Taiwan Kuomintang Vice Chairman Xia Liyan visited China this time and met with the Director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the Chinese government, Song Tao, and the member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, Wang Huning.
Zhao Chunshan, a senior advisor to the Kuomintang's official institution, the National Policy Foundation, was interviewed by Taiwan's Central News Agency last night. He spoke highly of Song Tao's statement that as long as the "1992 Consensus" and opposition to Taiwan independence are recognized, China welcomes visits from members of the Green Camp.
The Kuomintang believes that it is a fresh thing.
Xia Liyan met with Song Tao earlier, but the news of that day did not mention this statement.
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in Taiwan has been clarifying and rejecting the acceptance of the "1992 Consensus" in recent days.
According to the Central News Agency today, Kuomintang Vice Chairman Xia Liyan led a delegation to visit the mainland. During their time in Beijing, they separately met with Wang Huning, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, Song Tao, the newly appointed director of the Taiwan Affairs Office, and Yin Li, the Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee.
During the meeting between Xia Liyan and Song Tao, they discussed that the political foundation of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is the "1992 Consensus" and opposition to Taiwan independence. Zhao Chunshan, a senior advisor to the Kuomintang's National Policy Foundation, stated during the meeting that the Kuomintang's "1992 Consensus" is the authentic "1992 Consensus".
Zhao Chunshan analyzed that this is different from the previous meetings he participated in.
Recently, there have been video conferences with mainland academic circles, and in this conference, there was no mention of scholars discussing military reunification and the "Anti-Secession Law." Instead, the focus was on restoring communication and dialogue.
Zhao Chunshan pointed out that the situation between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is dangerous and may lead to war. Mainland China hopes to convey its intention to improve relations through the Kuomintang.
Because there is no mutual trust between the people and the Communist Party, the other party is still willing to work for the Taiwanese people, representing the hope that cross-strait relations will not be damaged.
According to Zhao Chunshan, Wang Huning also personally instructed Song Tao to tell him "the demands they (Taiwanese farmers and fishermen) have raised, you must implement them", and if it is not possible to solve them comprehensively, individual cases should also be handled.
The report did not mention whether the Kuomintang members visiting the mainland discussed face-to-face the daily disturbance caused by Chinese military aircraft and warships in Taiwan, the agricultural and fishing issues in some counties and cities in Taiwan, and whether the journalists from the Central News Agency asked about such issues during the interview.
The legal workers' union mobilizes for a large protest against the government's retirement reform plan once again.
On Saturday (February 11th), French unions once again launched a nationwide mobilization against the government's pension reform bill, calling on the public to take to the streets and express their opinions.
This is the fourth day of action in the social movement against the government's proposed reform of the retirement pension system.
And how many people respond to the call for the assembly may affect the next action plan of the trade union group.
This is the fourth national mobilization initiated by the eight major trade unions in France in the past month, and it is also the first time that the rally has been scheduled on a Saturday for this protest activity.
Given that Saturday is a public holiday for most French people, they do not need to choose between participating in demonstrations and protests or going on strike and losing their wages. Therefore, the trade union groups hope that today's rally can attract more people to participate.
The unions of the public transportation system, subway, and state-owned railway companies did not call for a strike today. The public transportation system should be able to operate normally, and citizens can take buses to the gathering points. At the same time, in areas where schools are starting winter vacation, people can start their vacations as usual.
The labor union group hopes that there will be over one million people participating in the rally today, while the police expect the national attendance to be between 600,000 and 800,000, with 90,000 to 120,000 people possibly gathering in the city center of Paris.
Since the start of the protest against the government's retirement pension reform plan, although polls show that the majority of French people do not support the measure to raise the legal retirement age from the current 62 to 64, the number of people actually taking to the streets and participating in the demonstrations has gradually decreased.
The first strike and protest activity on January 31st gathered 1.27 to 2.5 million people nationwide.
And the demonstration crowd on this Tuesday (February 7th) has dwindled to between 750,700 and 2 million people nationwide.
The retirement pension reform plan is currently being discussed in the French National Assembly.
The opposition party, especially the opposition group led by the radical left, has submitted countless amendment proposals, resulting in a very slow progress of the review process.
The debate between the ruling party and the opposition is becoming increasingly intense and sharp.
A member of the radical left-wing political party, France Unbowed, recently posted a picture on social media of themselves stepping on a balloon with the image of the Minister of Labor, sparking protests from the ruling party.
The Speaker of the National People's Congress finally announced a 15-day ban on this member's participation in parliamentary activities as a punishment for such behavior.
Although this reform plan has sparked the largest social movement in France in over 20 years, so far, the government has made some minor adjustments to the draft but has not made any significant concessions.
The union is ready to launch another action on Thursday, the 16th. On March 7th, when the reform proposal was submitted to the Senate for discussion, the union also planned to organize a demonstration.
China encourages raising the birth rate, urging donations of sperm from universities with high standards of quality.
Yunnan Province Human Sperm Bank issued a promotion on the 9th, seeking donations of sperm from individuals with a college degree or above, or current students. Those who successfully donate 8 to 12 times can receive a subsidy of 4500 yuan.
According to Taiwanese media reports today, the information surged on Weibo's hot search list and triggered many provinces and cities such as Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hubei, Shandong, and Beijing to follow up on the proposal.
According to a report by the Liberty Times, China encourages college students to donate sperm.
Various universities across the country are accepting sperm donations. Among them, Beijing has the highest requirements. In addition to educational qualifications, they also require a height of over 170 centimeters, well-proportioned facial features, no obvious hair loss, and nearsightedness not exceeding 600 degrees.
According to the report, the Yunnan Province Human Sperm Bank pointed out that sperm donors can receive a complete male reproductive health examination worth 1000 RMB, "especially semen and chromosome testing, which most people have never done before and is of great significance for understanding their fertility status."
The conditions for sperm donors include being over 165 centimeters tall, having a college degree or higher education, not being color blind or having color weakness, and not having genetic or infectious diseases such as hepatitis B.
According to a news report from China Tianmu News, the human sperm bank in Shaanxi Province has released a promotional poster with the slogan "Donating sperm for compensation is infinitely honorable," calling on young people to respond to sperm donation and encouraging netizens to share the related information to "spread love."
In Shaanxi province, the price is higher than in Yunnan. Qualified individuals can receive RMB 300 in cash each time, and those who complete a certain number of donations can receive a subsidy of RMB 5000.
And currently, it is known that Beijing has the highest price, with a maximum subsidy of 5150 RMB.
The last Communist Party Prime Minister of East Germany passed away today.
The successor of the East German Communist Party reported in a statement from the party, "Last night, Hans Modrow passed away at the age of 95."
Therefore, our party has lost an important leader.
"
On November 13, 1989, four days after the Berlin Wall, which had separated East Berlin and West Berlin for 28 years, was opened, Mordor had expressed that he would help turn East Germany into a democratic country.
At that time, due to the demands of protesters throughout East Germany for democracy and freedom, the leaders of the Communist Party were forced to step down.
Mikhail Gorbachev, after coming to power in the Soviet Union, once demanded reforms in the Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe as well.
In March 1990, Modrow announced the first and only free elections in the German Democratic Republic (GDR).
The election results led to him no longer serving as the prime minister.
Despite Modro's reforms, opponents accused him of trying to delay the political changes and unification that occurred in October 1990.
He was criticized for attempting to reshape rather than abolish the secret police.
In 1993, Modro was found guilty of election fraud in the May 1989 municipal elections, but was not imprisoned.
Some have claimed that these accusations are politically motivated.
From 1990 to 1994, Modro continued to serve in the German parliament and from 1999 to 2004, he served as a member of the European Parliament.
Modro sees himself as a reformer and hopes to change the Communist Party from within.
In 1999, he told Reuters that he did not want East Germany to return, but he believed that the achievements of East Germany should be recognized.
Modro was born in the small town of Jasenitz (now Jasienica, Poland) in Germany in 1928 and received training as a mechanic.
During the Second World War, he served as the platoon leader of the Youth Fire Brigade and became a member of the Nazi paramilitary organization Volkssturm towards the end of the conflict. This organization recruited men aged 16 to 60 to participate in the final struggle of the war.
At the age of 17, Modro was captured by the Soviet army and taken to the Soviet Union as a prisoner of war. There, he participated in anti-fascist courses and became a staunch communist party member.
In 1949, the year when East Germany was established, he returned to his country and found a job as a mechanic. He continued studying social sciences and economics and obtained a doctoral degree.
Modro is a staff member of the Free German Youth Movement. Almost all young people in East Germany joined the movement and rose to become the party chairman of the Dresden region through the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED) from 1973 to 1989.
He served in the East German parliament for over 30 years.
In 1990, Modrow became the de facto leader of East Germany and assumed the highest national position.
Iran commemorates the anniversary of the revolution, and hackers supporting the protests hacked the president's televised speech.
The Islamic Republic of Iran held an official gathering on Saturday to commemorate the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, but anti-government hackers briefly interrupted President Ibrahim Raisi's televised speech.
The President's live televised speech was interrupted on the internet for about a minute, and a group of anti-Iran government hackers' logos appeared on the screen. Their name is "Edalat Ali (Justice Ali)".
There was also a voice shouting loudly, "Islamic Republic, go to hell."
According to Reuters today, Iran commemorates the anniversary of the revolution, and hackers interrupt the national television station's coverage.
Iran's official commemoration of the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution faces the boldest challenge yet from young protesters demanding the hardline government in Laisi step down. However, Laisi still calls on the "deceived youth" to repent so that they can receive forgiveness from Iran's supreme leader.
Protests continue to sweep across Iran nationwide following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in the custody of the country's morality police in September.
Iran's security forces have carried out deadly crackdowns on protest activities, marking one of the most powerful challenges faced by the Islamic Republic since the overthrow of the monarchy that had lasted for 2500 years since the revolution in 1979.
As part of commemorating the anniversary of the revolution, Iranian authorities released hunger strike protesting imprisoned dissidents Fahad Mesami and Iranian-French scholar Fariba Adelkhah on Friday.
Earlier, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a decree of amnesty, which includes some prisoners who were arrested during recent anti-government protests.
According to the human rights organization HRANA report, as of Friday, a total of 528 protesters have been killed, including 71 minors.
The report states that 70 government security personnel were killed.
It is believed that as many as 19,763 protesters have been arrested.
For several weeks, Iranian leaders and official media have been calling for a vote at Saturday's rally to demonstrate opposition to protest activities and support for the government.
On Friday evening, on the anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, official media displayed fireworks as part of the government-sponsored celebration. People shouted "Allahu Akbar!"
"God is the greatest!"
However, in the gathering, one can also hear many people shouting "Dictator must die!"
"The death of the Islamic Republic" in the videos posted on social media.
On Saturday, the government television station broadcasted the live footage of official gatherings in various states across the country.
In Tehran, as part of the official celebration activities, domestically produced ballistic missiles, drones, anti-submarine cruisers, and other military equipment were displayed.
President Lacey's speeches are often interrupted by the slogan "America must die" - this is a signature slogan at state rallies.
The crowd continued to shout "Death to Israel".
Reuters said that Adelkhah, who has been imprisoned since 2019, is one of seven French nationals detained in Iran, which is a factor contributing to the deteriorating relationship between Paris and Tehran in recent months.
She was sentenced to five years in prison in 2020 on charges of national security.
They later placed her under house arrest, but she returned to prison in January.
Adelkhah denied these accusations.
And a week before Mesami was released, supporters warned that he faced the risk of death due to his hunger strike protest.
He was arrested in 2018 for protesting against mandatory headscarves.
The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded on Friday to Adelkhah's release, calling for the restoration of her freedom, including allowing her to return to France if she wishes.

Does the balloon incident open American eyes wider?
Strengthen restrictions on technology exports to China.
According to today's report by The Wall Street Journal, after the balloon incident, the United States is preparing to further tighten technology exports to China.
Current and former security officials have stated that the aforementioned balloon incident highlights the national security threat posed by China and will seek more political support to strengthen US technology protection.
The United States claims that the balloon carries antennas and sensors for intelligence gathering and communication.
According to former senior official of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and current member of the Washington think tank New America's Open Technology Institute, Martijn Rasser.
"This undoubtedly adds fuel to the fire and supports the hardline stance towards China."
White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Thursday to reporters, "We will also consider taking broader actions to expose and address China's larger-scale surveillance activities, which pose a threat to our national security as well as our allies and partners."
"US officials said they have informed the governments of over 30 countries about the situation of the balloon incident mentioned above. International coordination is crucial in dealing with the threat posed by China."
Emily Benso, a senior researcher at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that in addition to the actions of the Biden administration, the newly established US-China Communist Party Strategic Competition Special Committee in the House of Representatives may also exert pressure on the United States to take more stringent measures to slow down China's development.
She said that members of Congress will feel increasing pressure to demand that they take a tougher stance, which may in turn force the White House to adopt a tougher policy.
The Wall Street Journal reported that many people who advocate for stricter export controls are also pushing for expanding the scope of regulation to include industries such as artificial intelligence.
The US government has also been formulating a plan for foreign investment review, examining whether American investments overseas pose potential national security threats from China.
Analysts say that the White House may face calls to expedite the implementation of the plan.
The rescue efforts in Turkey and Syria after the earthquake continue day and night.
Since the strong earthquake occurred in Turkey and neighboring Syria, rescue teams from dozens of countries have been working tirelessly day and night in the ruins of thousands of collapsed buildings, rescuing survivors trapped under the rubble.
In the freezing temperature, they often call for silence, as they strive to hear any sound of life from the dilapidated concrete pile.
According to Reuters today, two more women have been rescued after surviving for several days in the ruins of the earthquake.
However, the death toll from the earthquake has risen to 24,150 people.
The death toll in Turkey is 20,665 people, and the death toll in Syria exceeds 3,500 people.
The 7.8 magnitude earthquake that occurred on Monday has been followed by several strong aftershocks in Turkey and Syria. It is the seventh deadliest natural disaster of this century, surpassing the earthquake and tsunami in Japan in 2011, and approaching the death toll of 31,000 caused by the earthquake in neighboring Iran in 2003.
In 1999, a similar strong earthquake occurred in the northwest of Turkey, causing the death of more than 17,000 people.
Turkish authorities said on Saturday that two women were trapped for 122 hours after the deadliest earthquake in the region in 20 years, and rescue workers in Turkey rescued the two women from the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Another injured man, 55-year-old Masallah Cicek, has been confirmed to be rescued from the ruins of a collapsed building in Diyarbakir, the largest city in southeastern Turkey.
In the freezing temperature, rescuers often appeal for silence as they strive to hear any signs of life from the dilapidated concrete pile.
In the Samandag area of Turkey, rescue workers crouched under concrete slabs, whispering "Inshallah" - "God bless" - as they carefully reached into the rubble and saved a 10-day-old newborn baby.
He opened his eyes wide, and baby Yagiz Ulas was wrapped in a warm blanket and carried to the field hospital.
In the video footage, the emergency personnel also took away his mother. She appeared dizzy and pale on the stretcher, but her consciousness was clear.
Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay told reporters overnight that in the past 24 hours, 67 people have been rescued from the rubble, and a total of 31,000 rescue personnel have been deployed in the affected areas.
He said that there are approximately 80,000 people receiving treatment in hospitals, and 1.05 million people are homeless due to the earthquake, crowded in temporary shelters.
Due to the lack of food for many people under the cold winter conditions, there is an increasing number of doubts among the public regarding the response of the leaders of both countries to the disaster relief.
According to Syrian official media, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his wife Asma visited a hospital in Aleppo. It is reported that this is his first visit to the disaster-stricken area since the earthquake.
Earlier, the World Food Programme stated that due to the war situation making rescue work complicated, its stock in the rebel-controlled northwest of Syria is running out.
On Friday, Erdogan visited Turkey's Adiyaman province and admitted that the government's response did not meet the expected speed.
Opponents seize on this issue to attack Erdogan, who is running for re-election in the vote scheduled for May 14th, but it may be postponed due to the disaster.
Reuters reported that the anger towards the delay in providing assistance and initiating rescue work may affect the elections.
Even before the earthquake occurred, the election was seen as the most severe challenge to Erdogan's rule in the past twenty years.
Erdogan calls for unity and condemns what he calls "negative movements for political gain".
Turkish opposition party leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu criticizes the government's response.
Critics argue that "the earthquake is significant, but what is even more serious is the lack of coordination, lack of planning, and incompetence."

Hanoi - Vietnam News Agency correspondent reports that during the visit to Brunei Darussalam, on the morning of February 11th, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and his wife visited the University of Brunei Darussalam (UBD), also known as "Brunei University".
Universiti Brunei Darussalam is the largest higher education and scientific research center in Brunei, ranking third in the local university rankings.
Universiti Brunei Darussalam is one of the symbols of educational and training cooperation between Vietnam and Brunei.
Universiti Brunei Darussalam officially established a cooperative relationship with FPT University in Vietnam in July 2013, with the main area of collaboration being English training.
In addition to English, French, German, Japanese, and Korean, Brunei University has also included Vietnamese in its teaching curriculum.
During the visit to the University of Brunei, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and his wife had a conversation with students from the Vietnamese language class.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng is delighted that an increasing number of foreigners are interested in learning Vietnamese and is actively contributing to promoting Vietnamese cultural characteristics and local customs around the world.
Prime Minister Van Minhzheng of the government expressed his belief and hope that the Vietnamese language teaching staff at the University of Brunei will continue to strengthen. The students in the Vietnamese language class are becoming more and more interested in Vietnamese and are making efforts to learn it. They will be able to use fluent Vietnamese as soon as possible and become ambassadors for the friendly cooperation between Vietnam and Brunei.
Taking this opportunity, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh also communicated with Vietnamese students studying English at the FPT-UBD Global Center in Danang City through video, to understand their learning situation, especially during the pandemic.
Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh believes that the cooperation between FPT University in Vietnam and the University of Brunei Darussalam, especially the FPT-UBD Global Center, is a vivid symbol of educational cooperation between Vietnam and Brunei.
At the same time, we hope that the students in this center can make greater progress in their studies and contribute actively to the friendly cooperation between Vietnam and China.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng highly praised the achievements of the two countries in educational cooperation during discussions with the Minister of Education of Brunei and the leaders of Brunei University. This includes the collaboration between FPT University and Brunei University, as well as the initiative of Brunei University to incorporate Vietnamese language into its curriculum.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng hopes that Universiti Brunei Darussalam will continue to focus on ensuring the quality of Vietnamese language teaching and further expand the scale of Vietnamese language classes.
Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh highly praised the positive achievements of cooperation between the two countries based on the Memorandum of Understanding on Education Cooperation signed in April 2014. He suggested that Brunei continue to provide more scholarships and effectively carry out various short-term exchange training programs, such as the Global Discovery Programme and the Discovery Year.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng highly appreciates the establishment of Brunei University's first branch in Vietnam in Southeast Asia; he believes that the development scale of the university in the region and the world is increasingly strong; and further expands the cooperation relationship with Vietnamese higher education institutions.
Taking this opportunity, Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng and his wife planted a commemorative tree on the campus of Universiti Brunei Darussalam and left a message in the commemorative book.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng wishes Universiti Brunei Darussalam to continue to advance and contribute increasingly to Brunei's education sector, and to deepen and broaden cooperation with various educational and training institutions in Vietnam.

The achievements made have injected new impetus into the continuous development of the strategic partnership and comprehensive partnership between Vietnam and China, towards deeper, broader, and more effective directions.
During the visit to both countries, Prime Minister Van Mingzheng reiterated Vietnam's foreign policy of independence, diversification, and adaptability, expressing the willingness to be a good friend and reliable partner to all countries, as well as a responsible member of the international community.

What exactly is the "object" that was shot down over Alaska?
Confusing and full of speculation.
The US military once again used the most advanced stealth jet fighter F-22 to shoot down an unidentified object flying over Alaska on Friday afternoon (February 10th).
The location of the crash is ten miles from the coast of Alaska.
This is the second time the US military has shot down an airborne object in less than a week.
Last Saturday, a spy balloon from China drifted in the US airspace for several days before being shot down near the coast of South Carolina.
The Pentagon said that the second object shot down entered US airspace for the first time on Thursday night and was tracked by the US military while moving over the northeast part of Alaska. It was flying at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet) and was about the size of a small car, much smaller than the previous Chinese spy balloon that was shot down.
The Pentagon still believes that there is no evidence to suggest that this object is controllable.
John Kirby, the coordinator of the White House National Security Council's strategic communications, said on Friday that although the specific appearance of this object flying at high altitude is still unclear, it "poses a reasonable threat to the safety of civil aviation aircraft."
Kobe said that this object is different from the spy balloon found within the United States, as it does not have any "payload" hanging from it.
Kobe said, "We call it an 'object,' which is the best description we can currently make."
President Biden listened to the advice of the Pentagon before ordering the shooting down of this object. He made this decision "very cautiously," added Kobe.
The official description of this object by the United States can be roughly summarized as follows: it is about the size of a small car, without a steering wheel, without suspension devices, and flies at an altitude of about 10,000 meters.
But these pieces of information are still unable to answer basic questions, such as what exactly this object is, which country it belongs to, and what mission it is carrying out.
Many online analyses and speculations currently believe that this may be another Chinese balloon.
It may come from China, just like the spy balloon that invaded US airspace and the Chinese balloon floating over Latin America. They are carrying out some kind of mission in different locations.
Some people also associate this "object" in Alaska with "unidentified flying objects" (UFOs).
The report from the American Newsweek quoted former US Congressman Peter Meijer's tweet on Friday, saying, "I really hope this 'unidentified flying object' is also a spy balloon, rather than a legitimate UFO."
"The ironic conflation of alien spacecraft with weather balloons is surprising, but it is not worth triggering an interstellar conflict," said Meijie.
Mei Jie sent out this tweet shortly after Kobe confirmed that this object in Alaska had been shot down.
Newsweek reported that Mei Jie is not the only one who suspects that this object is a UFO.
Tennessee Republican Congressman Tim Burchett criticized the government's practice of concealing intelligence last month and called on the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to release the report on "unidentified flying objects."
I find it hard to believe the customer service attitude of Amazon.
I estimate that very few people will see this, but I still want to say a few words.
When we bought this piece of clothing, it was a zip-up hoodie, but in the end, it was given to me as a short-sleeved shirt.
After receiving the clothes, I immediately contacted Amazon customer service and confirmed that the clothes were still in stock. I requested an exchange, and the customer service said they would resolve it. Then I immediately noticed that the product name changed to short sleeves, and it turned out that the link I purchased was taken down.
Following the customer service's notification, either keep the goods and receive a certain amount of compensation, or return the goods.
Is this how Amazon handles things?
It's really unbelievable. It's not my fault that the clothes were sent wrong. As a consumer, I expect to receive the goods I should receive. I didn't make any exaggerated demands, but Amazon changed its name and said there is no stock.
This is my first long review, I hope this is not my last one.
Incomprehensible Sleeves
It is said to be made of cowhide, and it is indeed quite hard. However, upon closer inspection, there are many small cracks in certain areas, making it unclear whether it is genuine leather. Additionally, the sleeves of this garment are truly incomprehensible. Usually, the sleeves of a jacket are slightly longer than the hem, but typically only by 1-2 centimeters. However, the sleeves of this garment are a full 5 centimeters longer, covering the fingers.
Buying clothes is easy, returning them is also easy.
But when will the money be refunded?
The workmanship of the clothes is good, but the size is smaller than expected, so I had to return them. However, it has been over a week since I returned the goods, and I still haven't received a refund?
Moreover, the buyer needs to contact the unreliable Quanfeng Express themselves, which is the worst shopping experience since purchasing items from Amazon.
But the shopkeeper is still good, actively cooperating to urge the express delivery for timely refund, but this Quanfeng Express is really infuriating, dragging for about half a month before refunding. This kind of partner will hold back Amazon, with poor work efficiency and no sense of service!
More suitable for young people.
99 seconds kill.
The workmanship, color, and feel of the woolen trousers are all good. They are soft and of moderate thickness, without any kerosene smell.
Unfortunately, the design belongs to a slim type and is more suitable for young people.
3XL, the waist circumference is 2 feet 5 inches when laid flat, and the maximum size when stretched is 4 feet. It feels a bit tight around the waist when worn by someone who is 1.79 meters tall and weighs 80 kilograms.
It seems that there is no elastic band around the waist, so it is quite difficult to loosen the waist size.
In addition, wearing tight-fitting clothes is uncomfortable.
Very good, the color is not very bright.
Just bought it and it has already increased by over two hundred, what's going on?
The first time I used the cooperation of Tiantian Express, the delivery was not made when I was at home. Later, I actively made two appointments with the delivery person for delivery time, but that delivery person did not deliver. Later, they directly returned the goods to me. This damn delivery person has no integrity at all. I strongly recommend not using Tiantian Express again.
This time, I also returned a T-shirt, and the price has increased by over a hundred yuan if I want to buy it again.
Amazon should not have such products for sale.
Buy the product when it is on special offer, the price is not low, but the reviews are also very good.
When I actually received the product, I was dumbfounded. The surface of the goods had extensive wear and tear, with multiple areas showing signs of damage. It was either a defective or used item. I will upload pictures later.
I applied for a return, but the manufacturer said it was caused by transportation after seeing the pictures. Isn't this nonsense?
How is it possible for the inside of the product to wear out?
There are only two possibilities, either defective or used goods, or I intentionally damage the product and then return it.
Objectively speaking, I do not have evidence to prove that I did not damage the goods. However, based on my credit record of shopping on Amazon, I believe that such goods should not appear in Amazon's self-operated products. Choosing Amazon's self-operated products means trust. Customer win, we win. The customer's victory is the manufacturer's victory. I hope everyone can work together to improve. Thank you.
I have been using this product for less than a year, and two E2 errors have occurred. I don't know how to deal with it.
I purchased this product on July 30, 2015, but since March 2016, the right side of the receiver has frequently displayed a red E2. It seems that there is a problem with the transmission module, which does not align with what was stated on the Amazon website about the transmission module being able to work continuously for 7 years. I cannot find any after-sales service on the Amazon website, and I don't know what to do now.
It's okay.
The first purchase was defective.
Doesn't feel like new.
The label on the box has been torn off, and the label on the body is also damaged.
And it always goes white screen.
It's better after changing.
The exchange process is quite fast, but it is a bit blurry at night and the field of view is not very wide. However, it is sufficient for ordinary household use.
The only downside is that there is no card, I bought it myself, and I have also bought a phone on Amazon before.
There will be stickers on the packaging to prevent it from being opened. This time there are none. When buying a phone, there used to be a sticker-like seal that could be placed on the warranty card. This time there is none.
I don't know if it's because things have become cheaper or not, I'm very confused.
Waiting for the supplier's response.
The packaging has no markings. I directly called the supplier and they said that the lack of markings is normal for genuine products. They suggested that if I have doubts, I can send some scraps to Johnson & Johnson for verification, and they asked for my license plate number and phone number. They promised to send a text message to notify me to enter my information on the Johnson & Johnson official website for warranty registration. However, I still haven't received any text message until now.
Received the engine oil in the morning and changed it in the afternoon.
Second purchase.
Amazon's self-operated products are still very reliable.
The mechanic who changed the oil said that the oil is clear and indeed it is good oil.
Because it is the second time purchasing.
So I am still very reassured.
Express delivery is fast, and there is no picky place for packaging. After using this oil, the engine noise has significantly decreased.
The cost-effectiveness is good, it is difficult to find synthetic engine oil for less than 200 yuan.
Supporting Xingguan and Shengpai, effectively protecting the car.
Japanese Amazon's customer service issues have seriously harmed the interests of buyers (8c caterpillar shipped instead of 8cm caterpillar) (8c=14cm, 8cm=2c).
Admitting the mistake, but always shifting blame and emphasizing that the goods are from a third party, and cannot be controlled.
Order number: 503-4265464-1830254.
The size options I purchased initially were 7c, 8, and 9c. At that time, I felt that it was a trap, so I called the Chinese customer service of Amazon Japan and was clearly told that 8 meant 8c. However, when the goods arrived in China, I found that there was only 8cm. I feel that this is a deliberate trap set to deceive Chinese people (according to Amazon's after-sales service). Now, when I check the page, this option is no longer available.
Chinese customer service: We are very sorry for causing you any loss. We offer you two options:
1. If you return the goods, the buyer is responsible for all shipping costs.
2. If you do not return the item, we will compensate you with 1000 yen.
(Let me calculate the account. The shoes cost over 4000 yen, which is equivalent to 200 RMB. Option 1: I don't have the shoes, resulting in a loss of 200 yuan.)
Option 2, I had shoes, and in the end, they compensated me with 2000 yen, with a final loss of 150 RMB. Customer service: We have recorded it, and we will handle it seriously. The next day, they replied to an email saying that I did not accept the mediation of the Chinese customer service, and that was the end of it.
I proposed: When the purchasing page has confusing options like 7c, 8, 9c, the Chinese customer service helped me to mention that the commonly used size in Japan does not include "c" and is similar to 140. But have you guys ever checked other caterpillar pages?
All have beautiful codes, and there is a situation of mixing Japanese codes.
Moreover, why did you place the 8cm size between 7c and 9c? It is clearly the smallest size, what does it mean to put it there?
Chinese customer service: We provide Chinese service, but since we don't know that you want to ship back to your country, we will not compensate for your shipping fee.
I don't understand this logic again. I am Japanese, but I still need Chinese customer service. Chinese people living in Japan also do not need Chinese customer service. For tourists visiting Japan, they don't have the time to make international calls. So the question is, who needs to make a Chinese phone call for Amazon overseas shopping? It's just people like me who do Japanese online shopping.
Isn't Amazon's Chinese customer service convenient for those of us who shop internationally?
I am not very satisfied with this purchase.
This is the second time I have purchased Pampers diapers from Amazon. I bought a box when my baby was 2 months old and chose European imported paper diapers. I was quite satisfied with the first purchasing experience. My baby can use one diaper for the whole night, and it can indeed last for 12 hours without changing diapers.
But this time, when buying size L diapers, there were 2 separate packages in one box. After opening them, I felt that the paper was looser compared to imported Pampers, and after using them for my baby, they were still acceptable. There were no signs of leakage or diaper rash.
However, when it came to the second pack of diapers and started using them, red rashes immediately appeared on the inside of the baby's thighs and have not faded away until now.
I suspect that the two packages inside box 1 have different qualities.
I probably won't continue to purchase in the future!
Hope to pay attention to the transportation protection of packages.
This is the worst packaging and transportation I have seen in all my online shopping experience. There is absolutely no protective measures, such as cushioning foam or packaging cushioning materials, nothing at all.
Just a box that is deformed under pressure.
And the soft plastic box inside is packaged, the card box has been pressed open and deformed.
I hope it is genuine with guaranteed quality. I won't dare to buy things from Amazon in the future.
Preferably, it is more expensive domestically, but with some guarantee.
And the issue of product packaging, I saw comments from 2016 mentioning it, and it's still the same in 2019.
It is evident that Amazon does not value service feedback at all, and it is far behind domestic platforms such as JD.com and Tmall.
Looks good, but a little bit disappointing.
I really like the color of the whole cup, orange-red. Although I have a son at home, I still think that orange-red paired with yellow is very eye-catching.
It is smaller than I imagined, but it was originally intended to be used for carrying out, so it is still acceptable.
Last night, I tried it at home. After pushing open the bottle cap, the distance between the straw and the lid is too close. Because the position of the straw is vertically upright, my son always has to hold the protrusion on top of the lid to drink water. I wonder if this part can be improved.
It seems that other brands of straw cups have a point in making the straw inclined. When it comes to children's things, safety and comfort are really important.
Lightweight and large capacity
I like it because it is lightweight and has a large opening. However, having two separate compartments feels a bit unnecessary to me, and I don't know what to put in them.
After buying it, I found out that there is another brand on the American Amazon website that is very similar, and it costs less than 200 yuan.
Fake goods, the fakes are particularly severe.
Amazon sells fake goods, I'm also fed up.
The customer service said that because I have used it, I cannot return it. But how would I know it is fake if I haven't used it?
Because of trust, so sad, after all, it is a facial product, really go to the physical store to buy it, recognize the higher price.
Because it was a flash sale, I didn't read the comments. I have already submitted the e-commerce platform to the State Administration for Industry and Commerce. Let's fight for our rights together.
What's wrong?
Fake goods?
In short, it's a tragedy.
When I used the second piece, I chose one that claimed to refine pores. However, as soon as I opened it, there was a strange smell. I thought it was normal because I had never used this brand before. But when I applied it to my face, I couldn't stand the strong smell. It was indescribable. It immediately made me cough and my eyes were also very painful, causing tears to flow. I quickly took it off and washed my face.
I don't believe in superstitions, so I opened another piece of the same kind. It doesn't have such a strong smell anymore, and I'm currently applying it.
Thinking back, it smells a bit like low-quality perm solution in a hair salon.
I really can't imagine it. Does it mean that we have to stay away from Amazon's self-operated skincare products from now on?
Unscrupulous merchant
At the time of purchase, the activity page stated that a "Three-Body Trilogy" would be given as a gift for orders over 99 yuan. However, I did not receive this gift when I received the goods. When I called customer service, they said I needed to show them a screenshot of the activity page at the time of purchase. The problem is, who saves screenshots of web pages when buying things? You should be responsible for your own activities and not rely on customers to provide evidence. Buyers, please remember to keep evidence in the future.
Experience after use
The first time buying something on Amazon, there are several feelings. Let's start with the feeling after using the product. Firstly, it is indeed painless and there is no stimulating smell. Overall, it is very good. It only takes about 8 minutes to wipe it off, but there may be a small amount of hair residue on it, which is not noticeable unless you look closely. So overall, it is good. As for using it again in the future, I will continue to observe and use it to know.
Anyway, I think this thing is really good.
I placed the order on the 27th and received the goods on the 12th, which is a total of 15 days, or half a month. The delivery service attitude of Amazon is also very good.
Third, don't believe in Amazon's Black Friday. I placed an order on Friday and after waiting for 2 days, the price dropped by nearly 12 yuan, which means I bought it for over 170 yuan (including shipping fees). It feels like they raise the prices during promotions.
The customer service said there were price fluctuations, but I have been paying attention to the price for more than 10 days and it has been like this, with not much fluctuation.
Affordable price, made in Japan, with Chinese labels, comes with particles, definitely repurchase!
The cream has particles in it, giving a refreshing feeling. After using it, my teeth feel smooth and clean. It is much better than some second-hand products. They claim it is imported, but many items do not have Chinese labels, so I wonder where they were wholesale from.
In the future, as long as Amazon has it, I will never go to second-hand stores again.
Give a suggestion, sometimes I can't post my reviews on the Amazon app. I hope there can be some improvements in the application, so it can be better and better!
Over the years, excellence has become worse and worse, there is simply no quality of service to speak of!
Garbage excellence disregards customer needs and specifies delivery time from 19:00 to 22:00 when placing an order.
Because there is an elderly person who is inconvenient to get out of bed after surgery at home, so only in the evening it is convenient to receive packages.
As a result, they unexpectedly delivered it directly to my door at 12 o'clock noon without any prior phone notification.
If the delivery time is at the discretion of your courier, why bother pretending to give customers a choice of time?
If you cannot guarantee the service of your own logistics, then simply do not do e-commerce!
Let an elderly person with three wounds on his body get out of bed to open the door and pay for the delivery while also finding change.
There is clearly a contact phone number on the order!
No one has called to explain from beginning to end!
The so-called customer service for Zhuoyue.com is just a group of people from other places pretending to be helpful, they just go through the motions of handling your complaints and then give you a so-called response.
There will be no changes or compensation!
I have encountered similar issues with incorrect delivery times before, and I have tolerated it. But this time, I cannot tolerate it anymore. It is too much!
The new book I bought on pre-sale arrived with the front and back covers reversed. This clearly indicates a quality issue. How can they blindly send the book to customers like this?
No one will contact you even if you leave negative comments.
Over the years, excellence has become worse and worse, there is simply no quality of service to speak of!
I will not spend another penny on excellence.
The image quality is really unacceptable.
As a title like "Ancient Atlas", this book is really difficult to accept in terms of picture selection, layout, and printing. Some pictures even have mosaics and are so blurry that they cannot be identified.
Even if this book is not a professional atlas, even if it is a small-scale illustration, it should still live up to the vast collection of ancient literature left by our ancestors in the catalog!
(Moreover, many images can be obtained as clear original files from relevant industry resources.) What is the difference between using such images to create a book and not using any images?
I regret the lack of such academic spirit.
No comment on the text itself, as everyone has their own way of discerning.
Overall 2 stars.
When I was in the second year of high school, I read this book just out of boredom and curiosity. I didn't think I would get addicted to this kind of book, after all, web novels from Qidian didn't really interest me before.
And then...fell into a pit.
According to the plot, the whole book is relatively light and enjoyable. In the earlier part, when Ye Xiu was still in the online game, even the power struggles between guilds were not heavy because they were often made comical by Ye Qian Shen.
As for the part of the competition, it evokes a slight feeling of melancholy about the changes and alternation of the times (perhaps it's just my sentimental nature).
Reading the entire book took up a lot of my study time in my second year of high school, but I just couldn't stop.
The description of characters and emotional development in "Full-time" is extremely impressive. Even minor characters leave a deep impact on readers. Key characters such as Ye Xiu, Huang Shaotian, and Su Mucheng have a large fan base, while supporting characters like Jiang Botao and Chu Yunxiu are also well-liked. Surprisingly, there is not a single character in this e-sports novel that is detestable, which is a testament to the success of "Full-time" in character development.
And in terms of emotions, full-time does not have the problem of the harem beauties in general online novels, which are either beautiful or rotten. The commonality among all the characters in the story is that they like the game "Glory" and most of them want a fair and honorable victory.
There is no big conspiracy in small measurements, everyone looks so innocent and lovely.
This may also be why there are no annoying characters in Full-time.
The full-time IP is very large, and this is also thanks to this.
Setting aside the cultural phenomenon of online literature, Full-time is a good book.
How much he really can provide some passion and a little bit of touch.
Full-time work will be animated in April this year.
Actually, I have wanted to buy this set of books for a long time, but I have never had the heart to do so because my wallet is never thick enough. Then, when I wanted to buy it, I found that there were so many fake products on Taobao. Actually, there is a new version of the book recently, and I quite like the cover image, but I still plan to buy the old version first. So, I looked on Amazon and bought the whole set at once.
Next, let's briefly talk about the situation of the goods.
●The fourth book is not sealed, but it is new.
●The seventeenth plastic-sealed book was opened, but the texture of the book feels strange, unlike the others which are hard.
●The 23rd book is the same as the 17th book in terms of condition, but it is also harder than the 17th book, although very old.
The publishing houses of a few individual books seem to be different, like the 23rd and 17th books are from the same publishing house, unlike the others.
Overall, I am quite satisfied. There are 24 books in a large box, which is very fulfilling.
Lonely Little Lion
When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as "The Lost Corner", but there are actually a lot of words!
I read it three times in succession before finishing reading this book to the children. It is about a little lion who can shoot a gun and a little lion who loves to eat fruit juice gummies.
When I saw the scene of the lion eating the hunter, I felt a little uncomfortable in my heart. Modern urban people find it difficult to accept arrangements where humans are eaten by animals.
At the end, this little lion who had succeeded in human society lost himself. He is no longer a complete lion, nor a complete human.
Finally, only the back of the little lion remained, and I don't know where he went.
Perhaps many years later, the image of this little lion will still remain in the memories of the grown-up children, and one day, it will be recalled unintentionally, perhaps touching or inspiring her.
A collection of works with high cost performance.
1. I didn't know about TASCHEN before, but recently I have bought many of their books because they are so powerful, both in terms of their subject selection and their production quality.
There have been three versions of this work, with the largest version being similar to the complete collection of Michelangelo, measuring approximately 50 centimeters long and 34 centimeters wide. The medium version is about 36 centimeters long and 23 centimeters wide. This version is the smallest and comes with two volumes of books in a book box.
Personally, I think it is acceptable. Firstly, the price is cheap, and it is divided into two books with over 700 pages, which is convenient for browsing as a paperback edition. Secondly, it is different from the complete works of Michelangelo, where the paintings dominate. In this edition, Da Vinci's black and white manuscripts make up the majority. For readers with limited budget and non-art majors, this edition offers the highest cost-effectiveness for appreciating both paintings and manuscripts.
2. The explanation of the painting part is great, with composition analysis, draft analysis, and historical background (such as The Last Supper). However, it is unclear whether it is a printing or book size issue, as some shadow parts are too dark to see the details clearly, which is a bit regrettable.
3. Compared to Michelangelo's manuscripts, Leonardo da Vinci's manuscripts are much more rich in content.
The former is already a genius, while the latter's wide range of knowledge and high achievements cannot be described as genius.
If you only looked at his paintings before, you could only understand half of Da Vinci, but after reading his manuscripts, you will be completely speechless.
Garbage, whoever buys it will regret it!
I have never given a negative review before, but this is truly garbage. It's a waste of money. Seriously, give me a reason!
1. The clock is not accurate, suddenly it becomes January 1st, and the time resets to zero.
2. Poor quality belts are not made of silicone, and wearing them causes allergic reactions and blisters on the wrist.
3. Often unable to connect to the phone.
4. The battery life is only five days.
5. The sleep test does not display, the time is 0.
6. Not waterproof.
7. Other.
Logistics is too slow.
Ordered on October 16th, but received it on October 21st, very dissatisfied!
The delivery service is very poor. It is already slow to buy things on Amazon, but I didn't expect it to be this slow!
Overall satisfaction
Before, I was worried about the packaging of the camera, but this time it's fine. There is an inflatable bag inside, and the camera's three codes are consistent. It can also be registered on the official website. The shutter count is 0, so the rest can only be verified over time.
The delivery speed is quite fast. I want to complain about the delivery guy here. He left the valuable items at the gate and left quickly. I couldn't open the package and inspect it in front of him. I am speechless about this.
The merchant has considered the customer's needs before shipping the goods :)
The merchants are very responsible, they specifically call to ask about the screen size of the camera being used, truly considering the customers' needs.
The delivery speed is also fast.
The diamond film is also quite suitable and effective when applied.
Battery not fully charged
The machine is indeed good. I want to ask why it doesn't fully charge the first time I charge it. The charging indicator light is always red.
Currently, there is no official feedback channel for Amazon, so the only option is to provide feedback in the product reviews.
1. On March 29th, I purchased this book for 31 yuan through pre-order, and it showed that it would be delivered to my device on March 31st. At this time, the book cannot be previewed on the Amazon official website (because it has not been released yet).
On March 31st, the book that was pushed to the device had blank content, with only a message to stay tuned. Meanwhile, the e-book version of the same book on Amazon has been discounted to 18 yuan.
3. These past few days, I have repeatedly tried to delete the blank books downloaded on the device and resynchronize, but I still cannot obtain the electronic version of "The Essence of Business" that contains actual content. However, I noticed that the book is already available for preview on the Amazon official website.
Currently, I have a few thoughts.
1. The issue of price is actually not the most important, the key is how to replace the blank books on Kindle with books that have actual content now, instead of always downloading and seeing "coming soon".
2. I probably won't buy pre-ordered books anymore in the future, after all, in case they are delayed, it would be very complicated to download another book with empty content.
3. I hope that Amazon can provide a normal channel for feedback on such issues, so that there is a place to provide feedback when there are doubts about e-book downloads or usage (both work orders and online customer service can be used, you can refer to how the Microsoft official store handles it).
Not highly recommended for reading.
I read it a long time ago, and coincidentally, I saw it again and decided to write a review based on my memory.
This book is more of a collection of fragments about love in life rather than a collection of short stories.
The tone of this book is extremely plain, like plain water. The choice of words and sentence structure are pursued to the extreme simplicity, and the plot is also as quiet and plain as a street in the afternoon of summer.
Each short story is a snapshot of a small period of time in ordinary life, without a beginning or an ending.
Finally gathered together, titled "What are we talking about when we talk about love".
I think that this collection of novels, as well as its title, is like a form of performance art. The author wants to express that love is not just the joys and sorrows on stage, the everlasting love in urban legends, nor is it just the inseparable bond between two people. Love is not only limited to these aspects, nor should it be represented solely by them. Love is also the mundane and ordinary aspects of life, the monotonous and tasteless repetition of days. It also includes feelings of confusion towards life, the escape from reality, and the uncertainty of the future.
When reading this book, you may recall the quarreling couples around you, the dull marriages of people you know, and the unsatisfactory emotions.
This is exactly why I don't recommend reading it. From an aesthetic perspective, the writing style and plot of this book are dull and uninteresting. Unless your life is full of excitement or as sweet as living in a candy castle, reading it will just make you feel indifferent and bored.
And in terms of depth of thought, the everyday plot does not impress or expand one's thinking and perspective (which is different from Marquez's "Love in the Time of Cholera"), and the brief segments do not explore any issues, such as what kind of mistakes lead to the failure of love?
What are the reasons for the breakdown of the protagonist's marriage?
So I don't recommend reading this book, whether you read it or not doesn't really matter.
The author's ideas are expressed more through techniques and genres rather than the story plot, which is also the reason why the reading experience of this book is relatively poor.
Suitable for skimming, not for detailed reading.
The logic of this book is very good, but the content is not rich enough.
Explained what many sales theories are and why, but is weak in terms of how to do it, only pointing out the direction but not providing specific methods.
In addition, this book feels like it is pieced together.
Examples include both domestic and foreign individuals; both well-known entrepreneurs or salespeople and unknown individuals.
I don't know if this story was compiled for the purpose of providing an example, but it would be more convincing if some cases experienced by the author were cited.
The title of the customer keeps changing between "顾客" and "客户".
In the title, it is still "customer", but in the body of the text, it becomes "client".
In the e-book, there are also issues of typos, missing punctuation marks, and incorrect numbering.
In conclusion, this book is a good choice as an introduction to theory, but it is not very suitable for those who are already engaged in sales work and want to improve their sales skills.
Quick Introduction to Internet Finance Guidebook
This book is quite superficial, it can be said to be just an introductory course, which can help everyone quickly understand the overall picture of Internet finance, but to have a deep understanding, one still needs to explore on their own.
Moreover, since the book was written early, it did not mention the content of Alipay and WeChat's subsidy war to cultivate user habits. I'm afraid that the current market share of third-party payment is no longer as small as mentioned in the book.
Nowadays, many people go out to eat with just their mobile phones. Businesses have also stopped using UnionPay due to the high bank transaction volume.
But still, I am very grateful to the author for writing this introductory book. It is evident that the author has at least several years of experience in financial observation and is very familiar with the development history of finance both domestically and internationally. That is why they were able to write such easily understandable content.
It is easy to write in a lofty and grand manner, but the difficulty lies in writing in a popular and easy-to-understand way.
Appreciate you, but want you to know even more!
The first factor that determines a person's job satisfaction is not the level of salary, but whether they receive enough attention and appreciation in their work.
According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory, after satisfying basic survival needs, the most urgent need is the satisfaction of psychological needs - the desire to be understood, affirmed, and appreciated.
Indeed, for most Chinese people, it is difficult to express their feelings of love, gratitude, and appreciation, even if they have them, they will keep them silently in their hearts and not say them out loud.
The author explains five types of appreciation language in this book: affirmative words, thoughtful moments, acts of service, pleasing gifts, and physical touch.
I think what's important is not knowing what the five languages of appreciation are, but being able to sincerely appreciate and be grateful for the people around you, whether they are family, friends, or colleagues, using these five languages of appreciation anytime and anywhere.
In fact, the closer people are, the more they need appreciation and gratitude, so that our lives can become better.
Learning to appreciate can also help companies retain talents to a certain extent and reduce resignation rates.
Thank you to the translator for bringing us wonderful foreign ideas and perspectives.
Due to cultural backgrounds and other reasons, there may be more or less differences between languages. If there is a chance to see the original version of the author, I believe there will be more to gain.
Thank you again to the author, translator, and editors for their hard work!
Suspected counterfeit goods, please Amazon to strictly review.
The quality is extremely poor, the packaging is loose and flimsy, it has no weight, and it is even worse than products sold on roadside stalls. It lacks weight and barcodes, and even the packaging of ten bags is loose and flimsy, which is not at all characteristic of a qualified product. This is the worst shopping experience on Amazon, and I have already applied for a return. It is definitely a quality issue. I suggest that the seller open their eyes and refuse to sell inferior products. Additionally, I also bought Xinxiangyin brand, which costs 23 yuan for 10 rolls at the supermarket. I have added a few comparison photos to further verify the inferiority of this product. In order to provide consumers with clearer reference and avoid economic losses and further unpleasant feelings.
Once again, we hope that Amazon can be meticulous and strictly control the source of goods.
Mediocre product, falls short of expectations.
Advantages:
1. Big brand, cheap price.
Advantage 2: The motor and blades are guaranteed by PANASONIC, and they work fine, but there is still a gap compared to what I expected.
Disadvantages:
1. There is no indicator light when charging, even the most basic power indicator is omitted. It seems that in the eyes of Panasonic, customers who purchase a 300 yuan product are also considered charity, without any respect.
2. There is a strong odor. When charging, even if it's just for 10 minutes, you can smell a strong smell of burning plastic.
The office was used for one day, and the whole room was filled with this plastic smell.
Compared to the Philips PHILIPS I used before at the same price range, although this Panasonic product has an additional blade, the quality is really disappointing for consumers.
Small packaging
When I received the package and saw "e-commerce version" written on it, I knew I had fallen into a trap again. It is smaller than what I bought at the supermarket, probably a size M. The packaging is different from the pictures in the product description, so-called "new version."
Three stars means I blame myself for being careless and not reading the product specifications clearly. I have no objection to you selling the M-size e-commerce version, but what does it mean when you say the goods are not the correct version?
E-commerce tricks are deep, it's better to go to the supermarket when there is time.
Just like that.
Don't like the taste.
Children don't like the taste of toothpaste very much. They always say it's spicy. Perhaps using a different word to describe it would be more appropriate, but for now, "spicy" is the only word in their vocabulary.
Bought it during a promotion, very cheap, so I don't feel like giving a negative review, four stars, but I won't buy it again.
Authentic, packaging is good.
The packaging is very intact, with an inflatable bag inside. It doesn't look like just a bare product without any online reviews.
There is also a layer of plastic film on the outer packaging of the bottle, just like the description in the picture. The delivery was also very fast, it arrived the next day after placing the order.
It is genuine, but it is out of stock. I don't know when it will be restocked.
A frustrating shopping experience
During Black Friday, I placed an order but waited for a long time without receiving it. When I checked later, I found out that the package had already been signed for. I asked my colleagues around me, but they all said they didn't sign for it. I quickly contacted the courier company, but they said that only the sender could initiate an inquiry. I contacted Amazon customer service and waited for more than ten days before finally figuring out that the package had been misdelivered to someone else. After several rounds of coordination, I finally retrieved the package, but the outer packaging had been opened. The product was still intact, but I don't know if it had been used. In short, it was quite frustrating.
Incorrect illustration
I thought I would receive headphones like the ones in picture 1, but I ended up receiving headphones like the ones in picture 2. It's not just about the inconsistency in the appearance, but what does it mean when the volume of the sound in the left and right earphones is different?
Although the names are the same, I still hope everyone can be careful and pay attention. Additionally, I kindly request the person in charge at Amazon to promptly replace the correct accompanying image. Thank you very much.
The operating system is average.
After using it for a while, overall, the picture quality is still acceptable, and I can't really feel any difference. However, the system is confusing to use, and the startup time is noticeably slow. It also lacks good settings, and the pre-installed software is not worth mentioning. The response speed is also average, compared to my colleague's device, it's not even in the same league.
Reading the comments, it says that the design is very user-friendly, but I can't find anything user-friendly about it. The positioning of the commonly used directional buttons and the back button on the remote control is really not commendable.
So, just treat it as a television, and use it with a TV box or something similar.
The price reduction is too significant.
The price reduction is too significant, it was originally over 100, but now it's 99!
I have accumulated many unreviewed orders on Amazon, so I will use a copied paragraph as the review content.
If I were to use this paragraph to evaluate, it means that this product is at least 85 points or above.
And for inferior products, I will never be lazy enough to copy and paste reviews. This way, other consumers can use it as a reference when making a purchase, and the merchants will also improve the quality of their products as a result.
Good quality at a low price, this is enough if you don't have a fever!
This cheap cable should still meet the HDMI certification standards. Compared to those overpriced items in the domestic Akihabara, it is much better. The cable is thick and flexible, and there is no noise in the 7-meter transmission. From now on, I will only choose Beisi for affordable cables!
The products are okay, but Amazon's after-sales service is really much worse than other websites.
After placing the order, I realized that I made a mistake, but I couldn't cancel the order because the cancellation option was no longer available. When I tried to contact the online customer service through the website, it kept showing an error link and I couldn't reach them.
After the delivery arrived, the delivery person called me. I told them that I didn't want it anymore and wanted to cancel the order, but the cancellation was not successful. The delivery person took it back and asked me to sign for it first and then apply for a return.
When applying for a return, it was only then that I was informed that food items cannot be returned once they are signed for. I tried calling Amazon customer service, but they also said the same thing, that signed items cannot be returned.
I have previously purchased items from both JD and Suning that cannot be returned due to policy, including milk, diapers, etc. I contacted customer service and they allowed me to return them. Moreover, even when I opened the diapers from JD and found them to have a strong odor, customer service still allowed me to return them. However, this is not the case with Amazon.
Rules are dead, people are alive. How did you handle contacting your customer service?
Tell me either I will accept it myself or let the delivery person buy it themselves. The delivery person already has a hard time, why should I make them pay for something that I didn't buy myself?
Okay, I won't back down either. I'll accept it myself, but I have to give your service a score of 1.
I advise everyone not to waste money.
First of all, I was full of anticipation to purchase it, thinking that a brand like Doule should not be bad. After receiving it, I thought the packaging was okay and the size was good. However, most of the box was soft, which cannot be seen from the outside. When touched, it had no taste when eaten, bland and tasteless. When bitten open, the flesh inside was a dark yellow color, indicating that it had gone bad. They sell both good and bad ones, and only about one-third of them are edible. I advise everyone not to buy it, as it is not cheap and the quality is very poor!
Once bitten, twice shy. I will never buy fruits from e-commerce platforms again in the future!
Where is the anti-counterfeiting label for the product?
The bottom corner of the bottle is severely dented, which should be caused by a strong impact. Looking at the outer packaging bag, the extent of the damage is distressing. After all, the packaging for food products is too simple, and it is also an international purchase. I haven't seen any obvious anti-counterfeiting marks. Opening the bottle is very easy, and the key is that a layer of honey inside the cap directly leaked out. The opening has almost no stickiness. Are all foreign products like this?
I, who was born in China, am a bit confused.
Should be genuine, right?
There is also a reminder when taking the photo that it will arrive around the 20th. This was received on the 14th. This is my first time purchasing overseas here, I'm just writing down my doubts, maybe this is all normal?
Delivery service needs improvement.
I bought a total of 5 delivery vouchers. When I went to pick them up, I made a reservation to pick up 3 of them for the first time, but only 2 were sent to me. After multiple communications, it was confirmed that it was a missed delivery and they promised to send the missing one later. For the second reservation, it happened to be on a rest day and there was no reminder on the website or WeChat that reservations should be made on working days, causing unnecessary panic. I suggest improving this in the future.
Good shopping
Good reviews for the product!
I still have more trust in products sold directly by Amazon. It is now very convenient to shop overseas, and the logistics time for buying from abroad is only a few days longer than buying domestically. I have to say that Amazon's ability to clear customs for overseas purchases to China is very strong, much faster than using a forwarding service. Therefore, many things are now purchased through overseas shopping.
I hope the quality and price of domestic products can be better. Many things are made in China, but it is cheaper to buy them after going abroad. I hope for improvement.
Garbage
Seeing such a package, I ask everyone: do you think it looks like roadside garbage?
Is it responsible to use a plastic bag to send a fragile plastic packaging from so-called Germany?
I think this kind of packaging is like garbage. When purchasing this product, the packaging is extremely crude and lacks any measures to prevent damage. It is simply packaged in a plastic bag. Upon receiving it, the package is completely deformed and the items inside are also damaged.
If I only encountered one like this, I would accept it, but I bought several and they are all like this. I contacted Amazon customer service, and they said I can return them, but I have to pay for the shipping, and then the shipping fee will be refunded to me in the form of a gift card.
I would like to ask, if I pay the shipping fee in cash, will you give me a gift card? Are you asking me to buy your gift card myself? And I also have to ship the product to the warehouse in Germany. Isn't this a hassle just to buy a product?
And I have been telling customer service all along, whose responsibility is it for such problems to occur, but customer service doesn't even say it's their responsibility, they don't even dare to take half of the responsibility. What kind of after-sales service guarantee is this? In short, I admit defeat! But I guess Amazon won't give me the opportunity to publish this review, they will just delete it directly!
The quality is very good, 5 stars, but the logistics is very poor.
1. The quality is very good, it's a killer product, the price is reasonable, and it's worth every penny.
2. Sturdy, sufficient materials, solid welding points, proper surface treatment, and good color.
3. Logistics is a weakness. The order placed on the 3rd arrived on the 11th.
4. If Amazon did not indicate an estimated delivery date of February 7th, I might be very satisfied.
5, but marking the expected arrival time is equivalent to giving the user a promise. When the promise cannot be fulfilled, the user feels very upset.
6. If you are not confident in making a promise, please do not make one.
7. In fact, I care a lot about the promises made by businesses.
8, so I gave a low score.
The gold thread will fade.
The effect is still there, but whether it is noticeable or not depends on the individual, or it may be a psychological effect.
One thing that is not very good is the golden thread. It was originally designed to look good, but in reality, this golden thread will fade. When placed on the car and touched a few times, there will be some gold powder on the hands and the car.
Hope the product can be improved.
This square-shaped one doesn't have any decorative effect, so don't put gold thread on it. If it falls off and dirties the car, it will be troublesome.
The item is in good condition, the speed is acceptable, and it will be divided into two packages with different packaging.
The speed of 8 days is quite fast, but it was divided into 2 packages, and the packaging is different. Obviously, one package has too much shock absorption, with thick cardboard and a layer of plastic, and the outer packaging is also easy to open. The other package is like a domestic express box, with a few cushioning airbags, which feels a bit perfunctory.
Yalan mattress is really good.
The 34cm mattress is not just thick, you can sleep directly on the mattress without a bed.
The quality is very good, both the front and back are quite soft, and the sleep is very comfortable. I quickly fall asleep lying on it.
After receiving the mattress, there were some stains in two places due to violent transportation by the courier. Yalan's customer service was very responsible and efficiently contacted to resolve the problem.
Not self-operated goods, Amazon is shameless.
The page clearly indicates self-operated, but in reality, it is delivered by the supplier, and the after-sales service is provided by the supplier. If there is any problem, please contact the supplier directly.
Want to cancel the order, I'm sorry, the order information has been transmitted to the supplier and cannot be canceled; want to return or exchange the goods, successfully applied for a return or exchange on Amazon, I'm sorry, no one is responding to you, you need to contact the supplier yourself to return the goods.
What the hell is this self-operated product?
The product is not delivered by Amazon, and Amazon does not take responsibility for after-sales service. The customer service actually said, "I will help you contact the supplier," and even claimed that it is self-operated. It is shameless and blatantly deceiving consumers!
Frustrating experience
The filter I bought from another online store before had good filtering effect. Even after using it for 28 days, it still didn't have any scale when I used it for one or two more days.
Because the quality of the things purchased on Amazon has always been good, this time I wanted to buy them here. It's the first time I bought a filter on Amazon, and I don't feel very good about it. Not only did it start to have scale early on, but there is also suspended black carbon powder in the filter even after using it for 28 days. I really don't know whether to continue using it or just throw it away. I'm very frustrated.
Not as good as imagined.
Compared with the power strips I have used before, the external workmanship is average. I hope that the internal structure is as described by the store. In terms of convenience of use, it lacks a display to indicate whether each individual unit is powered on.
The packaging is damaged, waiting for time to inspect the quality of the product.
The outer packaging is severely damaged, but the inner packaging box seems to be new. However, the instruction manual does not seem to be new. The renovation was only done in September and we are currently stocking up. I hope that it will not be damaged when the time comes. Please explain why several customers mentioned the packaging being damaged, yet you are able to handle it calmly. Thank you, Amazon!
Overall, it's not bad, just a few minor issues.
First time buying a water filter jug, I read a few review articles and felt that LAICA had better value for money, so I chose this one. After receiving the product, I followed the instructions to install the filter, and tried it out. Overall, it feels pretty good, but it seems that the original water and the treated water mix together from the spout of the jug when pouring water (the original water compartment is not sealed tightly).
When using it, make sure to wait until all the water has been filtered before pouring it out!
The picture is incomplete.
The picture does not capture the details of the side, and the details on the side are not consistent with the style of the main body, there is a big difference, this is the first point; this bead is produced in Thailand, but the place of origin is not indicated, this is the second point; the texture is not indicated, this is the third point; when I bought it in the UK, each item clearly had its own box, but here there is only a simple plastic bag, and there is no product logo on the bead, so how can I determine if it is genuine or fake.
Be cautious when making purchases, especially when buying things from Hong Kong.
Amazon customer service is really terrible.
Two days ago, I placed an order and today I received it only to find that the price has dropped by 40 yuan. I spent a lot of time trying to find customer service, and they said they couldn't make up the price difference, but I could repurchase and return the item.
This kind of customer experience and service is really a thousand times worse than that of certain online platforms.
It's okay, as a beginner, it's worth getting started.
The quality is passable, but it can't be compared to the top-notch diamond. I saw the price in the mall before, it's at least several hundred. It's my first time playing with a diamond, and it's alright.
The thing is not bad.
The item is really good. It was a gift for my girlfriend. However, I had some unpleasant experiences during the noon when the Canada Express delivery was made. The logistics company directly put the mail in the storage box and did not send me a verification message for pick-up. This caused me to make two trips unnecessarily.
However, the baby is indeed very good.
Worth buying
The little monkey is cute, and the discounts on Amazon are really great. Chow Sang Sang's official website delivers directly. I placed an order the night before yesterday and received it this afternoon. So fast.
Postal couriers are also very responsible.
Great!
A Customer's Confession
Received such a defective product, Amazon customer service tells you not to worry, we will contact you in about 54 hours.
2. Then you contact the customer service personnel, and they will tell you that this issue will be handled by a specialist who will inform you of the outcome.
You can never proactively contact this specialist, nor do you know her employee number or have a direct contact phone number. It is only her who contacts you.
Unfortunately, I waited for nearly 3 days, and this specialist contacted me when my phone was away for a while, so I missed their call.
I waited for 2 hours but did not receive a call from the specialist. During this time, I proactively contacted Amazon customer service and sent an email requesting them to call me back.
It has been almost 3 days and I still don't know what the outcome will be regarding the defective coffee machine I received from Amazon.
There is no problem with the products on Amazon in the United States. Overseas shopping is a good way to shop, but compared to the service of Amazon in the US, it is far worse.
For me, I can only continue to wait...
Uneven bottom
Because the reviews I read were all very positive, I had high expectations for this pot. When I received it, I liked it very much because it was lightweight. However, when I started using it, I noticed a problem. The bottom of the pot is not flat; it is raised in the middle and concave around the edges. The oil all runs to the edges, so even when I specifically bought it to deep-fry fatty meat, the oil couldn't cover the central area. It ended up getting burnt, and I couldn't even use the pot properly. I don't think this kind of design can cook food properly.
I don't know if it's just my bad luck, but I happened to receive a defective pot. Fortunately, Amazon provides a one-month return service, so I promptly returned it.
I cleaned the pot thoroughly and wasted my time for nothing.
Good product design needs to match the manufacturing process to achieve.
This is a product with a very simple design style.
The shape of the cube, the designer has treated the top with a slight curve.
Originally, it should have been very smooth lines.
Unfortunately, the final result was not able to be achieved.
Because there are two components on the top, the front is the control panel, and the back is the water tank cover.
The curvature of the top cover and the control panel are unexpectedly inconsistent, resulting in a height difference of about 2mm after assembly.
Although it looks like a very small crack.
But it can be said that it completely destroys the overall design sense.
I feel a little sorry for that product designer.
It seems that Midea's product manager does not have the ability to create products of this level.
(Regarding the feedback from the after-sales lady, of course, we cannot expect too much. However, when I heard the after-sales say that all the units of this product are like this, not just the one I bought, her indifferent and burdened emotions made me understand that we cannot expect too much from Meidi either.) On July 7, 2019, the water pump malfunctioned and the water output was low. It has already been repaired for the second time, and it broke again two weeks after the first repair.
After the discount, it is very cost-effective, but fake discounts on Amazon are very disappointing.
The baby was born a week ago and the insulation is extremely strong.
The outside of the pot cannot be felt with any heat, so it is not afraid of scalding people and can effectively protect the temperature from dissipating.
After one night, the air-conditioned room can still maintain a high temperature.
Amazon said that there would be a 320 yuan discount for the anniversary event, but later found out that everyone had discounts of 249, 289, and 299 yuan. I instantly felt deceived, but after comparing it with various miscellaneous brands of the same price at the supermarket, it is still more cost-effective. I can now carry it with me when going out in the future.
Vitamix 6300
I have been watching for a long time and saw that the Sony A6300 is on sale at Meiya and Zhongya Overseas Shopping at the same price. I quickly made a purchase.
Ordered on September 2nd, expected arrival on the 21st, but it arrived on the 12th, almost 10 days earlier. The speed is really fast!
The packaging box is not big, directly using the original packaging of Vitamix, Amazon is not afraid of it being damaged during overseas shipping!
The machine looks quite new and comes with complete accessories, but the cup placed on the base shakes a lot. I'm afraid that when I turn it on, the cup might fly out directly!
I asked a friend who has 5200, and from his description, it seems that his situation is not as relaxed as mine.
The randomly attached recipe is all in English, which is quite tiring to read. I couldn't find the Chinese version online either. This is a troublesome matter!
After receiving the goods, quickly buy a transformer. It should arrive in about 3 days, and then we can have a good time playing with it!
Too small, no umbrella cover, average material.
It's not a big size at all!
Second Totes umbrella, 1. This one does not have an umbrella cover. 2. The material of the umbrella handle is average. 3. Although it is labeled as "Large," it is actually a convenient umbrella for one person to use. It would probably be insufficient for two people to use.
Instead, the one I bought from Meiya before can be used by three people without any pressure.
Feeling not very good.
First of all, the box is not very sturdy. It deforms with just a little pressure. Secondly, the design on the back does not prevent the ABS surface from getting scratched when placed flat. Thirdly, inside the box, there is a piece of cloth wrapping around the handle, which stands out. And so on, various dissatisfactions. Lastly, the zipper is a bit unsmooth.
PS: The wheels do feel quite good.
It's okay.
Advantages: This backpack is relatively delicate and looks durable.
Disadvantages: The QR code on the card cannot be scanned (what's going on), the 15.6-inch laptop cannot fit in (can it be a little longer), this backpack's zipper can be locked, but a lock is not provided for the buyers, which cannot be considered as top-notch service.
Overall it's okay, but I'm not sure if it's genuine leather.
Overall, the feeling is okay. I don't know if it is genuine leather, so I can't make any blind judgments.
It can hold documents with A4 size, and can accommodate up to 80 pages of thickness. However, it may not be able to fit in box-shaped objects that are too thick or hard (that cannot be deformed).
The bag is very soft, and the inner compartments are also quite user-friendly. Overall, it is quite good.
Just that the bottom of the one I got has a small sand hole, I don't know if it's because of my bad luck or what?
Too lazy to go through the hassle of exchanging goods back and forth, so I'll just endure it.
Overall, it's worth giving it four stars.
ForRoyal is a globally popular camera strap and DSLR strap.
This strap is designed more scientifically, hanging on both shoulders, practical, and the front chest is fixed and protected with soft material for the camera, unlike other quick-draw shooters who use screws to fix the bottom and damage the camera, and it is also convenient to remove for photography.
Poor after-sales service
I bought a piano a month and a half ago, but it is missing a part. After notifying Amazon, they gave me a customer service phone number. After multiple communications, I still haven't received the part. May I ask what kind of efficiency is this?
After estimation, there may be problems and the maintenance will be more troublesome. Friends who are looking forward to good after-sales service should avoid it, as it is too troublesome!
There are minor flaws, but the sound quality is good.
The head of the instrument has a defect, missing one corner. It feels like a defective product and there are no free gifts either. However, considering the price, it is already quite good and the sound of the instrument is also good.
It's okay, the first face sheet.
Used for a long time, except for the lack of bass, overall it is still good.
The craftsmanship is not as perfect as imagined.
The first time I bought it, there was a problem with the item. All the lights were flashing and it couldn't be used.
Requested for an exchange, but it has been three days since the goods arrived in Shanghai and they still haven't been delivered.
The delivery person doesn't answer the phone when called.
The courier company said that they only have that contact information.
Amazon cannot find a place to file a complaint.
Without ever requesting it, I received a mysterious text message stating that the delivery would be delayed as per my request.
What is said about the transit issue later.
A very poor shopping experience, I have started to doubt the effectiveness of Amazon's logistics system and control system.
I estimate that we won't be able to get it today either.
The label has poor adhesive and is not waterproof.
Although Bluetooth connection is very convenient, the printed content is not waterproof and the surface is not laminated. Moreover, the adhesive of the label is very poor, so it is not suitable for cable labeling. It is very easy to fall off, so friends who buy it for cable management need to pay attention.
The pen is fine, but the packaging is too simple. It's just a cardboard box with no protective measures. Moreover, the box containing the pen is stuck with a large piece of transparent tape, and when I peeled it off, the glue remained on the box.
This is a very disappointing shopping experience for a six hundred yuan item.
But there is no problem with the pen.
Hope to make more improvements in packaging in the future!
The quality is impeccable, but when it comes to handwriting, it is not as good as 925-25.
First, let's praise Tian Tian Express. The air shipments are super fast, and the service attitude is also very good!
I have been using 925-25 all along, it's great. Just received 925-85, the quality of the pen is excellent, and the design is also very beautiful. The reason why I gave it four stars is because the pen is a bit heavy and not suitable for fast writing. The pen cap adjustment for lead length is a bit loose. In my opinion, 925-25 is more comfortable to use than 85.
Therefore, it has become a die-hard fan of Amazon.
Bought at a super discounted price, but the child doesn't like the reading pen.
Already opened, tried to apply for a return, unexpectedly they offer free home pickup.
Awesome.
Not advocating for returns, but this kind of service is only available in China.
Hope should not be abused.
In the future, all books will be purchased from here.
The earphones have sound bias and also have noise.
This earphone is really rubbish. I don't know if there's something wrong with my ears or if this earphone is really not as good as before.
Two years ago, I bought a blue one from a certain online store. The sound quality was good, without any noise, and the bass was also good. I used it for more than two years and it broke, so I plan to buy another one (urbeats) since I still feel it's good.
I saw another purple one that looked pretty good, but when I bought it and opened it today, I realized something was wrong. The sound is loud on one side and soft on the other.
At first, I thought it was just the sound effect of that song, so I didn't think much about it. But after listening for a while, I realized that this problem is quite serious. Not only is the sound distorted, but the bass effect is also not as good as before. There is also some noise. Is it only my purple one that has this phenomenon? Or is it true that the manufacturing process of headphones is not good now?
Very poor evaluation, very disappointed.
Tomorrow during the day, I must return the goods.
PS looks good.
This AV power amplifier has a complicated setup, rough exterior craftsmanship, and generates a large amount of heat.
The sound needs to be used for a period of time before evaluation!
Just got the German version of DN1080 on August 14th. The external workmanship is very poor.
1. The front panel and knobs are all made of plastic.
2. The audio input jack on the rear panel and the speaker output terminals are both of poor quality. It would be much better to find a CD amplifier integrated machine priced between 1000-2000 than this one.
3. The top cover is relatively thin, and it is concave on my transformer side. I had to open the box and use my hands to restore it. The top cover is loose when combined with the front panel.
4. The center of gravity of the entire machine is biased towards the transformer end, making it awkward to move.
It feels like a Sony entry-level machine, with that kind of workmanship, made in Malaysia.
I feel that Sony's decision to outsource production to China is much better than Xiaoma.
5. The machine generates a lot of heat. After watching a movie for about two hours, the top cover feels hot to the touch, reaching around 40-50℃. I'm not sure if it's because the transformer is too big and generates a lot of heat.
Nowadays, switch power supplies are commonly used, and this bulky transformer probably weighs around 4KG.
Sony should use actively cooling silent fans inside the machine, but after opening the box, only large aluminum heat sinks on the pipes can be seen.

Never opened
The battery is in use.
I really want to dissect it and see what's inside its belly.
Later, I thought, what if I am very disappointed after opening it, then it would be a waste of money; what if I am very satisfied after opening it, then it would be difficult to put it back, and using it would not be enjoyable.
Forget it, let's just assume Sony is using good batteries.
As for the detailed explanation of the battery power, it would make most people feel uneasy.
I'm fine. I have worked in a mobile phone factory for a long time. Apart from not understanding circuits, I can also be considered as a half battery engineer. I can handle it.
Overjoyed
Before buying, I really had no idea, but when I opened it and saw the packaging, I felt it was genuine!
Finally, when I touched the headphone cable, it felt very flexible and of great quality. I couldn't wait to plug it into my phone and open QQ Music.
I was shocked, the sound quality turned out to be 3D surround!
I asked at a physical communication store, and it's around 30, but it's definitely not the brand of Pinsheng, it's a miscellaneous brand. Therefore, although this Pinsheng model is 27 yuan, the cost performance is definitely worth having!
Worst online shopping experience
After placing the order on September 28th, the system showed that the goods had been shipped, but I still haven't received them as of October 12th.
Query Amazon order status, the seller did not provide a tracking number, unable to locate the order.
So I sent an email to the seller asking if they could provide the tracking number, but I haven't received a reply after two days.
Helpless, I called Amazon customer service, and they provided me with the seller's phone number. After making several calls, I finally got through and was informed that the package was lost. They said they could immediately send me a replacement.
Although I am very angry, due to the urgent need for the computer, I didn't say much to the seller. As long as it is sent to me immediately, it's fine.
As a result, the next day I called and asked, "Has the shipment been sent?"
The seller said it hasn't been sent yet, it can only be sent in the afternoon.
I called again in the afternoon and the seller said they would definitely ship it. They said they would ship it after five or six in the afternoon. However, when I called at seven in the evening, nobody answered the phone.
On the morning of the third day, I called again and asked if the goods had been sent out.
Can you tell me the order number?
The seller said that the item has not been shipped yet and told me that if I am in a hurry, I should order from another store. If I can wait, it will be shipped in the afternoon.
There's no other way, ordering from another place will take a long time again.
I can only rely on the seller to quickly ship the goods.
Finally, after countless phone calls and tracking, I received the computer on October 16th.
As for the quality of the computer, I don't know because it was bought for someone else. I will add comments later.
I just bought it half a year ago and haven't used it much. Now it's already malfunctioning. Can I ask if it can be repaired?
Because I have a desktop computer, I haven't used it much after buying it.
Just bring it along in your travel bag and use it a few times.
Recently, it was discovered that when the power is connected, it does not charge. It is necessary to use your hands to support the connection between the charger and the cable a few times in order to charge it.
I suspect it is a poor contact at the interface. I don't know if it can still be repaired now.
Strongly recommend Amazon to stop using EMS!
Product five stars, logistics one star, average three stars.
I don't understand why Amazon chooses to ship with EMS. It is widely recognized in the industry as unreliable. Well, at least computers are valuable items!
After purchasing, the order showed that it was expected to be delivered on the 20th, so the family waited at home for three days!
Why does it take four to five days to send from Xiamen to Fuzhou?
On the morning of the 22nd, I finally checked the logistics and it arrived in Fuzhou. I was prepared to receive it happily, but in the evening, without receiving any calls or messages, I checked the logistics and it turned out that it had been signed for at noon, and it showed that I had signed for it myself!
I was shocked in an instant!
Who am I? Where am I? Is this computer really the one I bought?
I seriously doubt life, is that okay?
Finally, I made a trip to the collection point before bringing the computer back.
The specific reason is simply because the delivery guy mixed up two tracking numbers, fortunately the package was not lost so it's fine.
I strongly suggest that Amazon should not use EMS anymore. If Amazon uses EMS to deliver in the future, I will definitely not buy from them again.
The goods are not bad.
First of all, I want to say that I just bought it a few days ago and found out that the price has dropped. I am not satisfied with this. Overall, it is not bad and has a high cost performance. The CPU and graphics card are sufficient for mainstream online games and a considerable number of large-scale single-player games. The heat dissipation is very good, but the screen has some backlight leakage (a common problem with IPS screens). The sound quality is not very good and the hard drive is not good (I suggest spending some money to add a solid-state drive). I took it to the after-sales service yesterday to have the hardware checked, and there were no problems. The pre-installed Windows 8.1 is not very user-friendly, so I recommend upgrading to Windows 10. The seller shipped it quickly and responded to all inquiries promptly. I received the invoice the day after receiving the computer, which is good, but unfortunately there were no free gifts.
(By the way, I want to mention that when buying keyboard stickers, do not go to a store called E Cool Digital Center on a certain online platform. They have slow delivery, poor quality products, and they do not offer refunds or exchanges for defective items. The owner also uses foul language frequently. Just wanted to expose this.)
The product is good, but the platform bureaucracy remains the same.
The quality of the hard drive is very good, and the cost performance is absolutely high. It is even cheaper than buying in Hong Kong. If you are not in a hurry to use it and can tolerate the logistics, I highly recommend purchasing it.
But it has to be said that the bureaucracy of the Amazon platform remains the same as a few years ago when I swore never to use it. You can never find out the actual logistics status, the information always says it will be delivered in a few weeks, and you can never file a complaint. That's how bureaucratic it is!
How many days have you received the goods, the logistics information is still that you will receive the goods in more than ten days!
Logistics is not worry-free.
The package arrived in this condition, not only was the packaging flattened, but the electrical appliance packaging was also opened. I don't know if it has been tampered with.
FYI
I haven't tried it yet, but I have always trusted Philips and hope that the battery life is longer than other brands.
I searched online and found out that it is a common problem for it to get water damage, and there is no warranty.
Depressed!
Now wrap it with cling film and continue using it, I wonder how long it can be used for?
Bought something that has been opened by someone else.
The tax on machines that cost over 300 is indeed quite high, so now that it's over 600, I feel more balanced in my heart.
When I received it, the condition of the sealing tape looked very wrong, as if it had been opened before. I quickly took a photo and sure enough, it tore open easily. After opening it, I found that the cardboard inside was also damaged. I was worried that it was returned by someone else. Before our anniversary, I quickly tried it on my husband. Fortunately, the machine had no power and there were no impurities in the blade. Otherwise, how could we return it from such a long distance!
It is unknown whether it is easy to use or if there will be any problems in the short term. As mentioned before, the items sent out when there is a shortage are indeed unreliable.
The level of experience is above average.
It is almost a top-level electric toothbrush, with many different tooth cleaning modes, but very few people would change the mode every day.
Used for half a year without any problems, brush every day, about one charge per week.
The brush head accessories are equally cheap to buy on Amazon.
The app is a bit difficult to use. Apart from changing the colors, are the other seemingly compatible issues due to the overseas version?
Hope to learn Falun Dafa.
The cost performance is very high.
It has been used 3-4 times already.
1. The packaging is intact.
2. It is very easy to use and cleaning is also very convenient.
3. You can totally DIY haircut and save money.
In conclusion, it was a very successful purchase.
There are counterfeit goods.
Last time I bought two packs, unexpectedly they were two different versions. Originally, the characters in the lower left corner of the packaging were green, but one pack was not, it had white characters. As a result, the cat had diarrhea after eating it.
I cannot determine whether the source of the goods from Amazon is fake or if they were switched by an employee during shipment.
I will buy it again, but if it is still fake, I will hold the relevant individuals accountable.
It is a hyphen!
On Amazon's picture, it shows a slash, but what I received was a hyphen. Isn't this deceiving?
The effect is okay.
Cats like to eat, that's the key point.
It does indeed have an effect.
Tight, narrow, bound feet, rubbing the back of the feet.
Not recommended.
1. UN is the most comfortable series of Clarks, but unfortunately this one is very poor.
Addition: Today I compared the previous UN series insoles (I threw away the shoes but kept the insoles) and the material is much worse than before. It lacks the elasticity and breathability of the previous ones, and feels fake and soft.
2. My instep is not very high, and the part that gets rubbed is about 3 centimeters forward from the highest point of my instep.
3. I bought three pairs of Clarks shoes overseas, but only one pair fits well.
I got so scared that I deleted all the fun things in my bookmarks.
I'll try Rockport later, if it doesn't work, I can only go to the ECCO physical store.
Substituting inferior goods for superior ones, poor quality control.
First of all, it is worth mentioning that Prime Overseas Purchase is very efficient. I placed an order on the 31st and received it on the 6th.
The color of the shoes looks much better than in the picture, and the leather feels good.
The shoe size is slightly bigger, with a foot length of 25 and a width of 10.5, I wear size 7.5W. It feels a little loose when worn, but I usually prefer a slightly loose fit. Adding a pair of insoles fits perfectly.
Secondly, the quality control of this shoe is really not commendable. One shoe sole has damage to the glue, while the other shoe upper has various scratches and a needle hole. The glue strip at the connection between the shoe upper and sole is misaligned, clearly indicating that it is a substandard product disguised as a good one.
A little regretful!
Bought for 280 yuan during the event, this price is quite cost-effective for purchasing Asics. Of course, according to the comments, there are even lower prices available.
Now let's talk about shoes. Advantages: The shoes are very lightweight, making running quite comfortable. They also fit well and won't be loose.
The appearance is very good but the shortcomings are also very obvious: I usually wear size 40 shoes, but this time I bought size 40.5. There is still about one thumb's distance at the front of the shoes, but this doesn't affect anything.
These shoes are "narrow", although there is still some distance in the front, they feel tight.
There is one more thing, the shoes may not be very breathable, and now they feel hot on the feet.
Foot massage
First of all, the craftsmanship of the shoes is very good and worth this price.
My feet are of a standard size. For running shoes, I wear UK7.5, EU41.5, and for leather shoes, I wear UK6.5. I have also bought several pairs of Amazfit shoes from Amazon, and they have always fit well. However, for this pair, I followed the reviews and bought one size larger, UK7. After trying them on, I found that they were noticeably longer due to the larger size. Additionally, the insoles were too thick, causing discomfort and pressure on the back of my feet. Furthermore, these hiking shoes are very stiff, making them very uncomfortable to wear.
If your feet are not particularly slim, it is not recommended to purchase this model.
If you really have to buy it, you can solve it by changing the insole, but the original insole looks very high-end, it would be a pity not to use it.
A perfect shopping experience!
Very satisfied, really like it, Amazon overseas shopping is definitely genuine, the quality is also very good, the products are of good quality and low price, I can buy with confidence, the after-sales service is very thoughtful, the customer service attitude is very friendly and kind, they handle problems patiently and efficiently, perfectly solving any worries, the accompanying express delivery is very convenient and reliable, the delivery staff consider the customers' needs, and always remind them to pick up the goods from the express cabinet in a timely manner. Thank you, Amazon, for providing customers with such a comfortable shopping experience.
In conclusion, our whole family enjoys shopping on Amazon Overseas!
Absolutely negative review!
I am really speechless about this agency and Amazon.
In the future, be careful when buying electronic products on Amazon.
Although it has been a long time, I still want to vent my frustrations.
Bought it during the winter sale, less than 200 yuan, but haven't used it for a few months at home.
When I tried to use it in spring, I found that it couldn't connect to the bracelet no matter what I did. The manuals of both devices indicated that they were compatible with each other. Later, I realized that it was probably a problem with the heart rate monitor, because even when I tried other devices, it still couldn't connect.
I called Amazon and they asked me to contact a proxy company. The proxy company asked me to send the equipment to Shanghai for testing at my own expense.
After nearly half a month, the items were returned exactly as they were, even the delivery box was the same one I used to send them!
No response, receipt, or test report!
At least tell me, is it good or bad in the end!
Call and ask, say that sending it back like this means there is no problem with the device, it is good.
But why can't I still connect? The proxy company replied, "That's not our problem."
Count me unlucky, I'm too lazy to be bothered by you guys for a 200 yuan item.
Serious mismatch in goods.
The goods are not up to standard.
The headband material is very good.
Much better than Nike.
The breathability is also very good.
Just the hat in front.
Very fine.
Are you here to be funny?!
Completely unable to block the sunlight.
Not returning the goods is because it functions well as a headband.
Although wearing it upwards cannot block the sun.
But different from other headband styles.
Keep it for future use.
The product quality is good, but Amazon lacks a sense of commitment, and the delivery person is very good.
I request delivery on Saturday and Sunday!
Amazon's regulations do not allow delivery on Saturdays and Sundays.
It made me drive 200 kilometers back from out of town just to pick up the goods!
Amazon, how can I love you again?
The delivery person is very proactive and enthusiastic.
Give a thumbs up!
The product, I tried it briefly, and it's not bad.
But I have never bought similar products before, so I cannot compare prices!
Size logistics
The craftsmanship is okay, but the logistics is too slow. Previously, all the shoes were delivered by DHL, but this time Apex... I have bought many UA shoes domestically, and the prices are not low. I feel like they are on a higher level than Nike and Adidas.
Actually, they are all equally good, so I choose to shop overseas.
Size: I am 176cm tall and weigh 68kg. My shoulders are average width, so I usually wear size 180 clothes. I bought a size M, and the length is slightly long at the hem, but everything else fits well. I see that there is a recommendation for size S, but is my figure really that slim? Or do I prefer a tight fit? Personally, I think a hoodie is better when it's loose.
Just the right size
Chest circumference 99, height 184, weight 84 kilograms. I consulted customer service before purchasing and was told to buy XXL. However, after reading the reviews, I decided to buy size L and it turned out to be the perfect fit. I almost fell for it.
The prices on Double Eleven are much more expensive than on Black Friday.
The quality of the clothes is very good.
The issue of affordable goods is very troublesome!
Ordered on the 18th, received the goods on the 25th, the speed of snails from Guangzhou to Beijing!
The purchased item is a cost-effective product. The description stated that there were scratches, but after receiving the goods, it was found that there were 4 screws and nuts missing!
The child is unwilling to return the item, thinking that it is not a big problem. However, the grandfather went to several nearby hardware stores but couldn't find the small parts/accessories.
Finally, it was stuck by grandpa!
It seems that I won't be able to buy affordable products from Z in the future!
The quality of toy processing is not good.
Most of the bolt holes are not aligned, it is very difficult to screw in the bolts. It can be seen that the processing quality is not good, and I don't know how long it can be played with. Because it was promised to a child, I will not return it.
Other comments say that installation is not difficult, is it only the one I bought that has a problem?
Very average
Could it be that I have bad luck?
The packaging is extremely old; the workmanship is average; there is only one type of music and it only lasts for 8 seconds before repeating continuously; the action is just shaking the head and walking straight ahead, without any changes.
Not worth this price.
Urgent need, so no returns.
The quality of the toy is good, but I have some complaints about the packaging.
Yesterday I received a package, which I bought from Amazon. It was marked as being delivered by EMS, but in the end, it was delivered by Tmall's courier. How many twists and turns did it go through? Is the relationship between Amazon and Tmall good?
Speaking of packaging, it is wrapped in several layers of cling film, without even a plastic bubble wrap inside. When opened, all the parts are placed in an empty box. Fortunately, the quality of the toy is good and there are no broken parts. However, it is much smaller than expected because it does not come with batteries. When pushed, it often derails, and it feels like the gap on both sides of the track is too large, indicating poor design.
Good quality, fun.
Very fun, the precision of the components is very high, the workmanship is exquisite, the quality is almost the same as Lego, and the price is very favorable during activities.
The process of assembling is quite interesting. I do the assembly, and my 5-year-old son plays with it. It's great.
He had so much fun that he laughed continuously. He will probably continue to buy toys from this brand in the future.
The machine is new, and cross-border online shopping is good.
I checked the Christmas sales and found out that the item I bought earlier was priced 150 yuan higher. However, the delivery is a bit slower now.
The machine is still good, all quite new.
Built-in Pikachu.
Then, if you connect the Poké Ball, you will receive a dream.
It's fun to play, better than PS4, and has high portability.
I have already bought Zelda, waiting for the game, let's try it again.
Producing and selling inferior products, the result is poor quality service. I bought six watches to give to my children, but one of them has incomplete number display and all six watches have different times, differing by more than ten hours.
I contacted the manufacturer to ask if there is a time check when the watches are put into storage. They replied, "Yes." Since there is, why is there such a big difference in time? It must be that the watches lack accuracy. In simple terms, they are counterfeit products. I'm not saying this to be rude, but look, it's clearly a quality issue (incomplete digital display) that they are selling. They are junk goods, aren't they?
I contacted the seller, and the seller gave a bunch of reasons and even complained that I shouldn't have bought their product in the first place. With such products, such sellers, and such after-sales service, who would dare to buy things on Amazon in the future?
In conclusion, I suggest not buying anything from this seller. Even if you do, it will be junk.
Amazon delivery issues
After receiving the goods, I found the following issues during inspection:
1. The packaging is severely worn out.
2. The instruction manual has severe folding marks.
3. The watch does not work, the desk lamp cannot be charged, and the time cannot be adjusted.
4. Contact Amazon customer service separately, and can only send it to the United States at your own expense, and then pay for the postage later.
5. The reason for the 2 points is that the customer service is not bad.
Can only say it's passable.
Time is not very accurate, it is about one second faster every day. In just a few months, it has already been more than two minutes fast.
I used to have a Seiko watch before, and it felt like it wouldn't lose or gain more than a few seconds in one or two years.
The calendar function is quite good, but the timing function is a bit redundant and is not used much. Occasionally, it may be accidentally triggered to enter the timing mode.
Solar-powered sports watch
Advantages: Solar charging eliminates the need to worry about battery replacement, it has world time, multiple alarms, and hourly reminders.
Shortcomings: The mirror surface is prone to scratches and dust accumulation.
Cost-effectiveness: The average price domestically is between 220-300, while purchasing from overseas costs around 180 (takes about 1 week to arrive).
Very satisfied watch
Definitely genuine, I have checked the goods at the counter. The appearance of the watch is very beautiful, with fine craftsmanship and sufficient materials. In addition, it has an imported mechanical movement, so it has a certain weight. It cannot be compared to those so-called mechanical watches priced at three or four hundred. This one is the real deal.
The timekeeping of the watch is very accurate, with an error completely within an acceptable range. There is a jewelry appraisal certificate in the packaging of the watch. The 12 o'clock mark on the dial is made of real diamonds. It is suitable for personal wear and also makes a prestigious gift.
Bentley watches are indeed very good.
The worst shopping experience ever in history.
On the evening of September 23rd, my wife accidentally dropped her phone. On a whim, she immediately ordered an 8p from Amazon. They had it in stock, but it wasn't sold by Amazon itself and there was no price markup (which made us secretly happy). However, because it wasn't sold by Amazon, the delivery was slower. The system showed that the latest estimated delivery date would be September 27th.
I feel so uncomfortable without a phone. The next morning, my wife woke me up at around 6 o'clock and asked me to think of a solution. Later, I checked on JD.com and found that there was stock available for a 256GB phone that could be delivered on the same day, so I immediately placed another order.
I just bought a new one and immediately thought about canceling the Amazon order.
Because the order was placed in the middle of the night, it was not possible to receive the delivery in the early morning. I called customer service around 7 o'clock and requested to cancel the order. The customer service replied that the order has already been cancelled and to wait for a notification message.
Okay, I will patiently wait. When it's noon, I will check my phone and see that the order is still in the "not shipped" status. I will immediately contact customer service and request to cancel the order quickly. The customer service replied that they have already processed it.
At 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I checked my phone and saw that the order was still there. I had no choice but to contact customer service again to clearly inform them that I had called for the third time. Please cancel the order and notify the seller not to ship it under any circumstances!
The customer service contacted the seller on the spot at my request and informed me that the seller is not familiar with the system, so they need to wait until they are familiar with the system before canceling the order.
But clearly tell me that the seller already knows and will definitely not ship, please rest assured.
When I checked the order status on Monday, it had already been shipped. I was speechless.
Since I couldn't directly contact the seller, I had to call customer service again.
The handling afterwards is simply speechless. Basically, I have to tell them step by step before the customer service can proceed with the operation.
The order is still in the status of delivery refusal so far, and is preparing for redelivery!
Doesn't Amazon take the initiative to follow up?
Anyway, the seller company has already received the money, so it doesn't matter if they don't follow up.
In the future, I will definitely not prepay for big items anymore. It's too troublesome this way.
It looks very beautiful.
I have been interested in this camera for a long time, but I didn't buy it because of reasons other than the price. This time, I bought it because I wanted to reach the free shipping threshold and the price was also acceptable.
After buying it, there were no other problems, except for the software connection. No matter what I did, I couldn't connect. My home uses a TP router. After searching online, I found that many people have this problem. I spent over two hours trying various router settings. In the end, I used 360WIFI as a medium to get it working. During this process, I called Xiaomi customer service, but they didn't have any solutions for this problem. They just told me to contact Amazon for after-sales service.
Another point worth noting is that I saw comments from users online saying that the minimum supported storage card for this camera is 8GB, and it cannot recognize storage capacities smaller than that. I hope everyone pays attention to this.
It feels okay to use, the picture quality is acceptable, but the sound quality is very poor. The machine has a certain degree of heat generation, and if it is kept on for a long time, the level of heat generated is somewhat difficult to accept.
In conclusion, this product still has many shortcomings. We hope everyone will be cautious when buying it.
The reason for giving 3 stars is because this was bought with my first love in life. We were together for almost 3 years, but he left me last year and it has been like this until now.
The reason for giving it 3 stars is because I bought it with my first love in life. I don't know how much I have used it now, maybe I have thrown it away!
We were in a relationship for almost 3 years, but she left me last year. Even now, whenever I think of her, my heart aches and I want to leave this world. She was the first woman in my life, and she brought me a lifetime of shadows and heartache. I still haven't been able to move on.
When I bought this phone, I thought about the two feelings at that time, that we could still share joys and sorrows together. But now, it is unbearable to look back. Perhaps this is how life is. Some people never want to meet them in their whole life, and some things they never want to know. But what can be done?
Every time I see this Samsung phone, she comes to mind. The pain fills my whole body. I have never been willing to spend more than 2,000 yuan on a phone, but when I bought it for her, I didn't hesitate at all. No matter how good you are to someone, when they change their mind one day, all the promises and vows become nothing.
Quality products in domestic brands
Huawei is a high-quality product among domestic goods.
Low-key bosses and companies rely on technology and quality to win customers, which is completely different from the current business atmosphere that relies on advertising to increase visibility.
Companies without strength simply cannot do this, nor do they dare to do so!
It is precisely because of this that I chose Huawei.
Bought it and have been using it for over half a year, always feeling very good, it's really great.
The reason why I didn't give it a full score is because there was a time when I was using its offline navigation and it had a positioning issue. I couldn't figure out the reason for it, but other than that, it works well.
Moreover, its online input feature allows you to search for your destination and automatically generate a route. After leaving WiFi, its offline navigation function is very practical as it does not require data usage. It directly communicates with satellites to achieve positioning and navigation, which is very convenient!
Sony is great.
Sony's low-end phones still have a strong sense of design, and they are also cheap in price. The screen is large enough and the battery life is excellent, making it very suitable for elderly people to use.
Although a long time has passed, this machine still has no problems.
However, because I have upgraded to the Z2, this phone has also fulfilled its purpose.
