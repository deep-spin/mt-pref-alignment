Unless someone volunteers to maintain it, the EURo document is the authoritative document.
If you find any discrepancies between the manual and the software, please check the Info
If we find that the content of this manual page is outdated and causes obvious confusion and complaints, we will stop publishing it. There is no other choice, such as updating the Info file while updating the man page, because there is no time left for us to do this other work to maintain Gnu cc. The GNU project believes that the man page is an outdated product and should spend time on other things.
If you need the complete and latest documentation, please refer to the Info file `gee' or the manual Using and Porting GNU CC (for version 2.0) (ft&/HAIZE#H GNU CC 2.0). Both are from the original Texinfo file gee. texinfo.
The C and C++ compilers are integrated. They both need to process input files in one or more of the four steps: preprocessing, compilation, assembly, and linking.
The source file suffix identifies the language of the source file, but for the compiler, the suffix controls the default settings:
gcc considers the preprocessed file (.i) as a C file and sets up a C-style connection,
g++ considers the preprocessed file (.i) to be a C++ file and sets up the connection in C++ style.
The suffix of the source file indicates the type of language and the subsequent operations:
.c C source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.C C++ source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.cc C++ source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
. CXX C++ source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.m Objective-C source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.i is a preprocessed C file; compile, assemble
.ii C++ files after preprocessing; compilation, assembly
.s assembly language source program; assembly
Compile the source program; preprocessing, compilation
.h preprocessor file; it is not usually seen on the command line. Other files with the same name are passed to the linker. It usually includes:
.0 Object file
.a archive file
Unless the -cec, -s, or -E options are used (or a compilation error prevents the entire process), linking is always the last step.
In the linking stage, all .e files corresponding to the source program, -1 library files, and unrecognizable file names (including specified .o H header files and .a library files) are passed to the linker options (OPTIONS) in the order specified in the command line.
The options must be given separately: de ' is completely different from `-d -r '.
Most of the `=-E : and `-W' options have two opposite formats: -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno-name).
Only the formats that are not default options are listed here.
Below is a summary of all the options, grouped by type, with explanations in the following sections.
Code Generation Option
Overall Option
Specify the language of the file you are about to enter (rather than the default selection based on the file name).
This option applies to all subsequent input files until the next `-x' option .language is encountered.
Close any explicit indication of the language, so based on the file name, the file after the RE AS E ` -x' option).
If you only operate on a part of the four stages (preprocessing, compilation, assembly, linking), you can use the `-x' option (or the file name after Ah) to tell geo where to start, and use the `-s' or `-E' options to tell geo where to end. Note that some combinations of options (such as `-x cpp-output -E') tell geo to compile or assemble the source file, and in the absence of the `-E' option, GCC replaces the source file name with `.o' and the `.ec' file name. You can use the `-o' option to choose other names. GCC ignores any unrecognizable input files after the `-ec' option.
The target document is complete.
Translation stops after compilation, no compilation file is generated.
Work with pipes instead of temporary files at different stages of the compilation process, because the compilers of those systems cannot read data from pipes, but the GNU compiler does not have this problem, and the compiler can accept C "dialects": C programs that conform to the ANSI standard.
This will close some of the features in GNU Cc that are not compatible with ANSI Cc, as well as the ANSI trigraph features that are rarely used, such as unix and vax, and the ANSI trigraph features that are not available in the mainstream libraries, even though they are available in the hosted environment (hosted environment), the main function returns an int value, and the typical example is almost all programs except the kernel. In the free-standing environment (f£reestanding environment), there is no standard library, and the program entry point is not necessarily main. The most obvious example is the operating system kernel. For details, refer to the latest information on the gcc website.
For function declarations without parameters, such as `int foo ();', treat them as C-style --- that is, do not specify the number or type of parameters. (For C++ only.)
Under normal circumstances, a function foo like this means that the parameters are empty in C++.
The list of features here is intended to support some aspects of traditional C compilers.
See the NU c manual for details, we have removed the details, so when the content is outdated, people won't HERI.
Except for one thing: for C++ programs (not C), the `-traditional' option has an additional effect, allowing this to be assigned.
He is the same as the `-Ethis-is-variable' option.
-traditional-cpp attempts to support some aspects of the traditional Cc preprocessor.
Especially the content mentioned above about the preprocessor, but not including the other effects of the `-traditional' option.
-fdollars-in-identifiers allows the use of `$' characters in identifiers (C++ only).
You can specify the `-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' option to indicate that the use of `$' is prohibited.
(GNU C++ allows the `$' symbol by default on some target systems, but not all.)
-fenum-int-equiv allows implicit conversion from ant type to enumeration type (MEF c++) .
In normal circumstances, GNU C++ allows the conversion from enum to int, but not vice versa.
-fexternal-—templates generates smaller code for template declarations (only for C++) by creating a copy of each template function only where it is defined.
To successfully use this option, you must mark `#pragma implementation` (define) or `#pragma interface` (declare) in all files that use the template.
When compiling with `-fexternal-templates ', all template instantiations are external types. You must make the necessary instantiations appear in the implementation files.
This can be achieved through typedef, which references each instance as needed.
Correspondingly, if the default option `-fno-extern-templates' is used during compilation, all template instances are explicitly set as built-in.
All member functions (except for constructor child functions and mnew or delete member operators) are considered virtual functions of the class they are in.
This does not mean that every time a member function is called, it will be through the internal virtual function table.
In some cases, the compiler can determine that a virtual function can be called directly; in this case, it is called directly.
-fcond-mismatch allows the types of the second and third parameters of the conditional expression to be mismatched.
The value of this expression is Void.-fthis-—is-variable, which allows you to assign a value to this (only for C++).
After merging the user-defined free storage management mechanism into C++, the assignable `this` becomes outdated.
Therefore, by default, the assignment of this inside a class member function is an invalid operation.
However, for backward compatibility, you can make this operation work by using the `-fthis-is-variable' option.
-funsigned-char defines char as an unsigned type, just like unsigned char.
All machines have their own default char type, which can be either unsigned char or signed char.
Ideally, when relying on symbolic data, a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned char.
However, many programs are written using only simple chars, and this is because they are working with signed numbers (or unsigned numbers, depending on the target machine).
This option, and its opposite, make such a program work on the corresponding default value.
The type of char should always be explicitly defined as signed char or unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly like one of them.
If no explicit declaration of the 'signed' or 'unsigned' modifiers is made, these options are used to define a signed or unsigned bit field.
By default, the bit field is symbolic, because the basic integer types they inherit, such as int, are signed, but if the `-traditional' option is specified, the bit field is always unsigned.
-fwritable-strings stores string constants in writable data segments and does not treat them specially.
This is to accommodate some old programs, and changing the string constant is a very bad idea, and the `-traditional' option has the same effect.
Executive Summary
The impact of COVID-19 on the drug market
Its impact may be similar to the economic crisis of 2008
The global COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the world into an unprecedented crisis.
In many countries, the disease has overwhelmed healthcare services and nearly collapsed, and the restrictions imposed by governments have caused serious disruptions in the global economy.
The impact of the epidemic on the drug market is not yet clear and difficult to predict, but it may have a profound impact.
Some producers may be forced to find new ways to manufacture drugs, as restrictions on movement also limit access to precursors and essential chemicals.
Traffickers may be unable to cross borders due to travel restrictions, and may have to find new routes and methods.
The patterns of drug use and supply may change, and the government's ability to respond may be hindered.
The changes brought about by COVID-19 are unprecedented, but we can still learn some lessons from past crises.
After the 2008 economic crisis, some drug users began to look for cheaper synthetic substances and switched to injecting drugs.
At the same time, governments around the world have cut their budgets related to drugs.
If governments around the world respond to the current economic downturn in the same way, interventions and drug treatment services may suffer a severe blow.
In addition, the priority of interception operations and international cooperation may be reduced, making it easier for traffickers to operate.
Some countries have a large amount of drugs smuggled through commercial flights, and these countries are expected to be the most directly affected by drug trafficking activities.
Messengers carry synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine in their backpacks or hide them in their personal luggage, sometimes in large quantities. Due to restrictions on air passenger transportation in almost all places, the activity of supplying drugs through commercial air travel may be completely disrupted.
Although the international postal supply chain has also been disrupted, activities involving the use of the dark web and parcel delivery for trafficking may increase.
In the long run, the economic recession and related lockdown measures could disrupt the drug market.
Due to the rising unemployment rate and lack of opportunities, the poor and vulnerable groups are more likely to use drugs in a harmful way, develop drug addiction, and turn to drug-related illegal activities, whether it is production or transportation.
Drug trafficking organizations may take advantage of this situation to provide services to vulnerable people and recruit new members to strengthen their ranks.
As the government's capacity to respond decreases, these changes are likely to take root quickly and become the new reality for many communities.
Expansion and complexity
Market growth
The population growth model partially explains the reason for market expansion
Drug addiction is on the rise worldwide, both in terms of the overall number of addicts and the proportion of addicts in the world's population.
In 2009, it was estimated that there were 210 million drug users, accounting for 4.8% of the global population aged 15-64, while in 2018, it was estimated that there were 269 million drug users, accounting for 5.3% of this population.
Over the past two decades, the growth rate of drug use in developing countries has been much faster than that in developed countries.
This reflects to some extent the difference in overall population growth during this period, with developed countries increasing by 7% and developing countries increasing by 28%, but it also reflects the faster growth of the young population in developing countries.
Adolescents and young adults account for the largest proportion of drug users.
During the period from 2000 to 2018, the population of this age group in developing countries grew by 16%, while the population of this age group in developed countries decreased by 10%.
Urbanization is a driving factor in the current and future drug markets
In both developed and developing countries, drug use is more common in urban areas than in rural areas.
The overall increase in drug use is partly due to the large-scale migration of the population from rural to urban areas. Currently, more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas, compared to 34% in 1960.
Urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, especially in developing countries where urbanization trends are more pronounced.
The increase in wealth is linked to the increase in drug use, but the poorest people in the world bear the greatest burden of disease, and drug use is more common in developed countries than in developing countries.
Drugs such as cocaine are more closely linked to the world's wealthier regions.
Similarly, within each country, the drug addiction rate is higher among the wealthy social class.
However, the rate of conversion to drug addiction is higher among people with lower socio-economic status.
Data from a few countries show that there is a link between harmful drug use patterns and low income.
These patterns seem to be less common in the wealthier social classes.
The economic constraints caused by the global COVID-19 crisis are likely to exacerbate the risks faced by the most vulnerable groups, including drug users.
For example, changes in the labor market, such as an increase in unemployment, have traditionally been associated with an increase in drug use, but this pandemic has already forced millions of people worldwide out of work.
The COVID-19 pandemic may lead to further expansion of the drug market.
The related restrictions on COVID-19 have led to a decrease in air and land transportation, and smuggling by sea may have increased as a result.
Recently, there have been reports that cocaine goods can be directly transported from South America to Europe by sea.
Complexity increased
The appearance of non-international controlled substances is stable, but new types of opioids with potential harm are increasing, and the drug market is becoming more complex.
In addition to plant substances such as marijuana, cocaine, and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control. The non-medical use of drugs is also rapidly increasing.
There are about 500 new active substances on the domestic market in member countries every year.
Currently, most of them are stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and a small amount of opioids.
Although the total number of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportion has changed.
Among the total number of new psychoactive substances identified in 2014, opioid new psychoactive substances accounted for only 2%, but by 2018, this figure had risen to 9%.
Many of the new psychoactive substances in the opioid family are similar to fentanyl, and their effects and dangers have been proven, leading to overdose deaths in North America and other regions, but to a lesser extent.
In North America, fentanyl is used as a cutting agent for heroin and other drugs, including cocaine and methamphetamine.
Some evidence suggests that there is also injection of new psychoactive substances in Europe: a study of discarded syringe residues in six European cities found that many syringes were contaminated with new psychoactive substances.
The use of new psychoactive substances may gradually become entrenched among vulnerable groups
New psychoactive substances of a single type have almost never formed a large market.
But evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among socially marginalized groups such as the homeless and prison inmates.
22 countries reported the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, with most countries identifying synthetic cannabinoids as the main challenge.
Control of precursor chemicals forces drug makers to innovate.
Drug traffickers and manufacturers have been looking for alternatives that are not only less regulated, but also chemicals that are specifically designed to evade regulation, known as "special precursors".
Restrictive measures aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19 are likely to put further pressure on drug traffickers who rely on precursor chemicals.
Evidence from Mexico suggests that this has already become a reality: in March 2020, a shortage of methylphenidate precursors imported from East Asia reportedly caused methylphenidate prices to rise in Mexico and the United States.
The market is constantly changing
Synthetic drugs replace opioids in Central Asia and the Russian Federation
The opioid market in Central Asia and the Russian Federation appeared to have changed between 2008 and 2018.
The number of opioids intercepted by the authorities in the Russian Federation has fallen by about 80%, while the number of people receiving treatment for opioid use has fallen sharply.
But the market for stimulants seems to be thriving.
There is evidence that methamphetamine and various cathinones, including ephedrine and a-pyrrolidinopentiophenone, are now readily available on the Russian drug market.
Russian authorities reported that the number of secret drug manufacturing sites that produce various illegal drugs has risen sharply in recent years, doubling in two years, reaching 152 sites in 2018.
Methamphetamine markets in Afghanistan and Iraq are growing
As early as 2012, surveys of hospital, prison and other institutional staff had already revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.
Crystal methamphetamine has become another major drug of concern, in addition to "fenethylline" and qumador.
A 2015 study further confirmed these findings, with drug users saying that marijuana was harder to obtain than "fenethylline" or methamphetamine.
Recently, the Iraqi authorities have discovered several methamphetamine processing points, and the Narcotics Control Bureau has expressed concern about the large-scale import of pseudoephedrine drugs, which are used as precursors by methamphetamine processing points.
In Afghanistan, methamphetamine production seems to have started in 2014.
Since then, the seizure of methamphetamine has been steadily increasing.
However, the seizure volume in the first half of 2019 was 657 kilograms, a significant increase from the previous year.
Methamphetamine believed to originate from Afghanistan has been seized in large quantities in other countries, indicating that the country's production is rapidly increasing.
Policy changes and trends
Most jurisdictions that have legalized the non-medical use of marijuana have seen an increase in marijuana use
Eleven jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay, and the United States allow the manufacture of cannabis products for non-medical use.
In most of these jurisdictions, cannabis use has increased since it was legalized, although the same trend has been observed in other jurisdictions that have not legalized non-medical cannabis use.
In the two states in the United States where marijuana was first legalized, Colorado and Washington, the number of adults using marijuana for non-medical purposes has increased, especially in the past month and on a daily or almost daily basis, exceeding the national average since 2012.
All indicators show that marijuana use in Uruguay has increased since 2011, and last month it almost doubled.
This indicates that the main reason for the increase is the regular and frequent use of marijuana.
Short-term data from Canada also shows that while the legal market expanded from 2018 to 2019, usage was also increasing.
However, in 2019, 40% of marijuana users still obtained some products from illegal sources.
Is the global decline in the seizure of marijuana herb due to the legalization of marijuana?
In 2018, the global cannabis herb seizure volume fell to the lowest level in 20 years, due to a decrease in seizures in North America, which fell by 84% in the past 10 years.
In comparison, seizures in other parts of the world almost doubled during the same period. The pattern of seizures suggests that policies aimed at liberalizing the marijuana market played a key role in the decline.
The regulation of new psychoactive substances seems to have a deterrent effect, but it is still difficult to assess the effectiveness of the regulation of new psychoactive substances in China.
Some countries that have different regulatory systems for new psychoactive substances show different prevalence rates of new psychoactive substance use.
In other countries, the use of new psychoactive substances has decreased after the adoption of domestic legislation.
Weak groups face harm from both legal and illegal drug markets. Opioids used for pain management and palliative treatment are mainly available in high-income countries.
In 2018, more than 90% of all opioids available for medical consumption were in high-income countries.
About 50% are in North America, 40% in Europe, and 2% in Oceania.
These countries account for about 12% of the world's population.
It is estimated that the population of low-income and middle-income countries accounts for 88% of the global population, but the consumption of pharmaceutical opioids is less than 10%.
Obstacles to obtaining opioids for medical use are related to many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems, and prescription practices.
People living in poverty are more likely to suffer from drug addiction. In 2018, about 35.6 million people suffered from drug addiction.
Poverty, limited education, and social marginalization can increase the risk of drug addiction and exacerbate its consequences. This has been confirmed by research in high-income countries, where individual socio-economic trajectories are not only related to their status at a certain point in time, but also to the risk of drug addiction.
Drug addiction also deepens socio-economic disadvantage, further increasing the risk of unemployment, poverty and homelessness, thus fuelling a vicious cycle. These outcomes may also be related to the stigmatizing attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.
Women, ethnic minorities and immigrants, sexual and gender diversity groups, people displaced by armed conflict or disasters, and people living in rural areas may also be disproportionately affected by drug addiction or face problems in accessing treatment services.
According to the disability-adjusted life years (DALY) indicator, which estimates the number of healthy years of life lost due to disability and premature death, harmful drug use has had a wider social impact in the past 10 years.
From 2007 to 2018, the global disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to drug use increased by 17%.
The increase in the number of years of life with disability due to hepatocellular carcinoma caused by untreated hepatitis C among injecting drug users is particularly high - up to 40%.
The relationship between drugs and violence is complex, making it difficult to determine all the causal relationships between the use of psychoactive substances and violence.
Limited data from around the world suggests that intoxication may be an important factor in homicide.
But in violent incidents, alcohol seems to play a greater role than drugs.
Although drug use may lead to crime, in some cases, this connection can be partially attributed to multiple mediating factors, such as socio-economic disadvantage and other types of adversity caused by individual risk, family environment, and peers.
The connection between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.
If there is a stable criminal structure, large-scale organized crime activities, including international drug trafficking, can be carried out without violence.
In the short term, the existence and degree of violence is more dependent on changes that destabilize the balance of power between organized crime groups, such as changes in the size of the illegal market, the death or imprisonment of well-known criminals, and law enforcement measures that weaken one group and strengthen another.
Latest trends
Marijuana is the most commonly used substance, and opioids are the most dangerous
It is estimated that 192 million people used marijuana in 2018, making it the most widely used drug in the world.
In comparison, there were 58 million people using opioids in 2018.
However, the related harm of opioids is ignored due to the small number of users.
Of the estimated 167,000 deaths related to drug abuse in 2017, 66% were caused by these substances, and 50% of the estimated 21 million years of life lost due to disability or premature death believed to be caused by drug abuse were caused by these substances.
The non-medical use of synthetic opioids has exacerbated the public health crisis
In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, the crisis is exacerbated by ketamine; in North America, it is fentanyl. These two regions have almost no commonalities in terms of economic, demographic data, or general drug use patterns, but they are both struggling to combat the ketamine crisis fueled by easily obtainable and cheaply produced substances.
In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has led to an increase in opioid overdose deaths over the past 20 years.
In 2018, of the 67,367 overdose deaths registered in the United States, two-thirds involved fentanyl.
Canada also reported similar results, but with lower numbers.
One of the reasons why fentanyl causes overdose deaths is the unpredictable effects of fentanyl in the illegal drug market.
In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, the market for non-medical uses of kombucha has grown significantly.
In the region, more and more Qumado patients are receiving treatment.
In 2017, the global seizure of fentanyl increased significantly, reaching a peak of more than 125 tons.
However, in 2018, after India passed a new law regulating ketamine, global seizures fell to 32 tons.
The crisis in these two places was caused by the production of simple and low-cost products, and the lack of international supervision on the production of ketamine and many other similar substances or their precursors.
The supply of these substances in both the pharmaceutical and illegal markets has exacerbated the crisis in these two regions, making it more difficult to detect and prevent their abuse.
The use of stimulants is increasing
The field of stimulants is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are increasingly used in their main markets.
In 2018, there were about 19 million people using cocaine, as cocaine is quite popular in North America and Western Europe.
There are about 27 million people who use amphetamines in the same year, of which methamphetamine is the most commonly used amphetamine in Southeast Asia and North America.
According to most of the indicators available, the use of methamphetamine has been expanding in these two regions for the past 20 years.
In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist, sometimes even substitute for each other. When the use of one drug increases, the use of the other drug decreases, and sometimes both drugs increase and decrease to meet the demands of the same market.
COVID-19 increases the risk for injecting drug users
It is estimated that there were about 11.3 million people injecting drugs in 2018, and about 10% of global HIV infections are caused by injecting drug use.
More than 1 million people who inject drugs are infected with HIV, and 5.5 million people have hepatitis C.
In 2017, there were about 585,000 deaths due to drug abuse, half of which were caused by hepatitis B, and most of the injecting drug users with hepatitis B have not been treated.
The shortage of opioids caused by the COVID-19 restrictions may lead to the use of more easily available substances such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or the mixing of opioids with synthetic drugs.
As some users switch to injecting or inject more frequently, more harmful use patterns may emerge.

EU summit debates refugee policy, EU officials: reception process faces bottlenecks - Xinhua News
EU summit debates on refugee policy, EU officials: every step of the reception process is a bottleneck
[Reporter of Global Times in Belgium, Niu Ruifeng] According to AFP on February 10, at the latest EU summit on that day, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said that the EU leaders agreed to establish stricter policies on illegal immigration, making it easier to expel illegal immigrants.
The move by the EU is reportedly in response to growing concerns about illegal immigration in Europe, and the core issue for the EU now is that there are few illegal immigrants who can ultimately be repatriated.
According to the summit document, EU leaders called on the Commission to "immediately mobilize a large amount of EU funds" to strengthen external borders with infrastructure and surveillance.
However, the EU and its member states have been arguing over issues such as the cost of fences.
Von der Leyen has repeatedly stated that EU funds will not pay for the costs.
However, some member states' diplomats said that if the EU could share the cost of installing cameras, observation towers, and other infrastructure along its external borders, it would free up national budgets and speed up the construction process.
The European Euractiv website reported that EU officials admitted that every step in the refugee reception process is a bottleneck, with limited reception capacity and overburdened immigration authorities in member states unable to stop refugees from submitting "countless" asylum applications in EU countries, and the EU's refugee reception system is in a near-permanent crisis.
According to the European Commission, the Schengen countries in the EU received more than 920,000 asylum applications last year, an increase of nearly half compared to the previous year.
At the same time, the EU recorded over 330,000 illegal entries last year.
In this context, the summit also agreed on a "principle" that EU countries can deport illegal immigrants back to their home countries based on a court ruling by another member country.
In addition, the report states that EU leaders also agreed to "increase the use of the concept of a safe country," which will pave the way for the EU to establish a common list.

The United States' upgrade of the "chip war" has dealt a heavy blow to the global semiconductor industry - www.chinanews.com
Recently, the United States' "chip war" with China has been escalating - first, the Netherlands and Japan, under pressure from the United States, agreed to start controlling the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China; later, foreign media reported that the US government is considering cutting off all links between US suppliers and Huawei, prohibiting US suppliers from providing any products to Huawei; the Biden government is also preparing to announce an executive order to restrict US investment in sensitive Chinese technology industries...
In recent years, the United States has never stopped its actions to suppress China's "chip" development. On the one hand, it has accurately suppressed the semiconductor supply chain in China, and on the other hand, it has built a semiconductor industry chain alliance to "decouple" from China in the advanced semiconductor industry.
Whether it is to establish a "technological alliance" with South Korea, or to establish a "semiconductor alliance" with South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, or to establish a "semiconductor industry chain" through the "Quadrilateral Mechanism" and the "Indo-Pacific Economic Framework" of the United States, Japan, India and Australia, the United States is trying to build a closed supply chain cycle dominated by the United States by introducing the means of politicization, alignment and weaponization into the semiconductor industry, in order to make up for its shortcomings in the field of semiconductor manufacturing and maintain its leading position in the global semiconductor industry.
However, the United States' overly aggressive "chip warfare" against China is also "injuring the enemy a thousand times and harming oneself eight hundred times".
Recently, the well-known chip manufacturing equipment supplier in the United States, Panlin Group, announced that it will lay off 1,300 full-time employees due to the latest round of export bans on chip manufacturing equipment to China, and plans to lay off 1,400 temporary employees in the next two quarters.
The Dutch ASML, a global leader in lithography machines, recently warned that banning the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to a rise in semiconductor prices.
According to American media analysis, after the US government imposed arbitrary pressure on the semiconductor and other industries in China, many American companies suffered, including developers of electronic design automation tools, chip designers, manufacturers of wafer manufacturing equipment, and chip manufacturers themselves.
The United States claims to suppress China's advanced semiconductor industry, but it has dragged down the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain.
The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, and a closely connected global semiconductor industry chain has already been formed.
According to estimates by professionals, based on specialized division of labor, the entire production process of semiconductor products needs to cross borders more than 70 times, and the whole process takes about 100 days.
Although the United States has a relatively strong semiconductor industry foundation, it is relatively weak in manufacturing capabilities, especially in advanced process technologies, and is heavily dependent on the East Asian region.
Even if the United States tries to guide the advanced chip supply chain to the "small circle" regional development dominated by the United States, the regional distribution and interdependence of the global semiconductor industry will be difficult to change.
The United States is vigorously "rebuilding" the semiconductor industry chain to "de-China", which has severely hit the global semiconductor industry.
Chips are the core of the global future industry, and the development of the chip industry cannot be achieved without the joint participation of all countries in the world.
In recent years, the United States has taken a series of unilateral actions, successively issuing the Innovation and Competition Act, the 2022 US Competition Act, and the Chips and Science Act, using technological hegemony to consolidate its technological superiority; it has used "carrots and sticks" to coerce chip manufacturing enterprises such as Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, and Samsung to set up factories in the United States, and has made great efforts to ensure the United States' global leadership in the field of chips.
In the short term, the United States has indeed caused trouble for China's semiconductor industry and related industries, and has reaped real benefits.
However, in the long run, the United States' excessive suppression will force China's semiconductor industry to continuously break through, causing the United States to lose a huge Chinese market, which will ultimately greatly weaken the innovation willingness and innovation ability of American technology enterprises, and harm the development of the global semiconductor industry.

First batch of personal pension financial products go on sale, with the shortest holding period of only 360 days - www.chinanews.com
First batch of personal pension financial products go on sale
7 products from home institutions can be selected, the shortest holding period is only 360 days
Personal pension financial products have finally been launched.
On February 10, China Finance Network released the first batch of personal pension finance products, and 7 personal pension finance products from Bank of China Finance, Agricultural Bank of China Finance, and China Postal Savings were officially launched.
At this point, the "shelves" of personal pension accounts have finally been filled with four types of products: personal pension savings, personal pension investment, personal pension insurance, and publicly-offered personal pension funds.
It was reported that the first batch of personal pension financial products are all publicly offered net value open-end products, including 5 newly issued products and 2 existing products. Except for one product that is a mixed type product, the remaining 6 products are all fixed income type products.
The Beijing Youth Daily reporter found that of the five new products, four were from Guotai Asset Management, all of which were fixed-income products, with the shortest holding period being 365 days, 540 days, 720 days, and 1080 days, respectively. The corresponding performance benchmarks (annualized) were 3.70% - 4.20%, 4.10% - 4.60%, 4.40% - 4.90%, and 5.25% - 5.75%, respectively.
The remaining new product is "Postal Savings Wealth Addition Hengjinyi 1095 Days 1", which is also a fixed income product. It began collecting on February 10 and ended on February 19, with a risk level of level 2.
Among the two surviving products, one is the Agricultural Bank of China Wealth Management “Agricultural Bank of China Unity·Dynamic” 360-day Science and Technology Innovation RMB Wealth Management Product, which is a mixed type and has a risk level of three.
Another surviving product is “Postal Savings Wealth Addition Hengjin No. 1”, a fixed-income type, which started collecting on December 30 last year and officially started operating on January 4 this year. Its cumulative net value on February 8 was 1.0011.
According to the "Opinions of the Office of the State Council on Promoting the Development of Individual Pension Funds", the financial products that individual pension fund accounts can invest in include bank wealth management products, savings deposits, commercial pension insurance, and publicly offered funds.
The launch of the first batch of personal pension financial products marks the official launch of the purchase of financial products by personal pension investors through personal pension fund accounts.
In November last year, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission issued the "Interim Measures for the Management of Individual Pension Business of Commercial Banks and Wealth Management Companies".
The Regulations stipulate that participants can purchase personal pension products such as personal pension savings, personal pension investment products, personal pension insurance products, and publicly offered personal pension fund products through their personal pension fund accounts.
Subsequently, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the Ministry of Finance, and the State Administration of Taxation issued a notice, clarifying that the individual pension system will be implemented in 36 pilot cities and regions, including Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei Shijiazhuang, and the Xiong'an New Area, as well as Jinzhong City, Shanxi.
As of the end of 2022, there were 19.54 million people participating in personal pension plans, 6.13 million people paying premiums, and a total premium amount of 14.2 billion yuan.
Previously, banks participating in the pilot only offered three types of products: personal pension savings, personal pension insurance products, and publicly-offered pension funds.
Now that personal pension investment products have gathered together, how should investors choose?
According to experts from the research and development department of ICBC Wealth Management, compared with other personal pension products, the pilot phase of pension wealth management products and personal pension wealth management products have three characteristics.
First, it is stable, with a more complete risk management mechanism, more stable investment strategies and principles, and the implementation of third-party independent custody by non-parent banks.
Second, it is long-term. The trial period for retirement financial products is 5 years or more, and the holding period for the next batch of individual retirement financial products will be 1 year in principle, with a holding period of 3 years or more encouraged.
Third, it is inclusive. The threshold for purchasing products is low, usually starting at 1 yuan, and some are as low as 0.01 yuan. The custody fee, management fee, and other fees for the products are more favorable.
Professionals point out that investors should choose according to the characteristics of the product and their own risk tolerance.
Personal pension savings have the characteristics of a long term, high interest rate, and high safety, which is suitable for people with low risk tolerance; personal pension insurance products focus on protection, which is suitable for people who cannot bear investment risks and can accept stable returns; while personal pension investment products and publicly offered fund products do not guarantee the principal or returns, they have certain investment risks, but the expected returns are high, which is suitable for people with certain financial knowledge and high risk tolerance.

The fitness industry should overcome the crisis of trust - www.chinanews.com
Another large gym "explodes"?
Recently, the issue of protecting the rights of members of the Zhongjian Fitness Club has attracted the attention of the public.
After the Spring Festival, many members found that their local stores were not open as usual. Subsequently, rumors about the closure and disappearance of the institution caused panic among members, leading to the involvement of the public security and human resources departments.
Finally, the relevant person in charge of the agency came forward to respond, promising to strive to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of employees and members, and the storm was finally calmed down.
Some branches of fitness institutions have encountered operational problems and have been temporarily closed. Consumers could have waited calmly for the problems to be resolved, but why is it that many members' first reaction is "something is wrong"?
The controversy over the rights of fitness club members is a deep-seated problem of the industry's crisis of trust.
Traditional fitness centers in China generally adopt a prepaid model, and “making money from users who don’t come” is the underlying logic of their development.
Obtaining cash flow through pre-sale of membership cards, opening new stores, and seemingly being able to cycle back and forth, in fact, eating the rice of the ox and the rabbit, cannot form a stable profit model.
Negative information about gyms closing down and other industries is being reported frequently, which has a strong impact on consumer confidence.
In terms of market prospects, gyms are certainly a good business with a "money-making" path.
Although the fitness industry has its ups and downs, it has always been the focus of capital.
Multiple data shows that the popularity of cultural and sports consumption has been rising, and the market has been recovering steadily.
Specifically in the fitness market, as the living standards of residents continue to improve, the concept of a healthy lifestyle has become deeply ingrained in people's hearts, and the fitness industry has great potential for development.
The better the situation, the more the industry needs to pay attention to the quality of development.
However, some institutions are blindly optimistic about the fitness market after the recovery of consumption, just coming out of the crisis, and are blowing the trumpet of expansion, pouring all their financing funds into the construction of new stores.
It cannot be denied that in recent years, many institutions have withdrawn due to the impact of the epidemic, and the industry has undergone a reshuffle. At this time, powerful enterprises choose to increase their acquisition efforts selectively and reorganize, which is not a bad opportunity.
However, in order for the fitness market to enter a virtuous cycle and embark on a steady and sustainable path, the industry must change its traditional model and business strategy.
Only by persevering and rebuilding consumer confidence and safety can we truly win the market and win the future.
Compared to the rush to capture the market by Big Construction New Store, what the fitness industry needs most at present is to calm down and optimize services, and to stabilize users with high-quality development.
First of all, we need to rely on services to retain users.
Gyms are service industries, and their essence is to adhere to the "user-oriented" principle, to focus on user needs, and to put the emphasis on improving and upgrading services.
Secondly, digital transformation is needed to improve user experience.
For example, the popular Internet gym model nowadays, which allows users to pay per session and choose their own location.
At the same time, body data and movement data can be effectively utilized, and social needs can be met, realizing a complete service loop from online to offline.
Without private sales promotion and without a large annual fee, users' concerns about gyms "running away" have been reduced, and their trust has been enhanced.
In addition, we should actively explore multiple business models.
Nowadays, sports consumption has moved from single services to scenario consumption, and fitness clubs are expected to become a new entry point for consumption. Surrounding products such as sports supplements and fitness equipment, which are necessary for fitness, may become new profit points, providing consumers with more choices.

Buy cheap and get a discount!
The real estate market in Nanjing is experiencing “price compensation” again - www.chinanews.com
According to a report by Yangzi Evening News (Reporter Ma Zhupo), in an interview on the 10th, a "price guarantee agreement" that had not been seen for more than ten years returned to the Nanjing real estate market. A property in the Jiangbei New District claimed "difference compensation", and before the handover, the discount of other properties was greater than the previous discount. The developer was willing to exchange houses for buyers and refund the difference.
The conditions of the “price protection agreement” are not few
The property in Jiangbei New District is called Poli Yanzi Cuiyuntai, and the buyer, Mr. Sun, told reporters that he found a “statement” when he visited the property last weekend.
The photos he sent to reporters showed that the developer of the project promised that anyone who purchased a property between February 1 and February 28 would be entitled to a change of property and a refund of the difference in price if the discount on other properties in the project was greater than the discount enjoyed by previous purchasers (limited to other unsold properties in the same type of unit, the same building, the same floor, and the same property type as the property in question).
Mr. Sun said that the property consultant said that this was actually a "price guarantee agreement", which was intended to reassure buyers that they did not have to worry about the developer reducing the price to promote sales. "Now, I'm afraid that if I buy it, it will be reduced in price, and I won't have time to go to the sales office to complain. If I don't complain, I will really feel relieved."
There are also many homebuyers who believe that the "price guarantee agreement" is a way to reassure homebuyers, but the conditions are not bad.
Ms. Zheng, who plans to buy a house in Jiangbei, said that the house with a guarantee must be of the same type, in the same building and unit, and there are few houses for buyers to compare, so the "threshold" is quite high.
Some buyers believe that due to information asymmetry, it is not ruled out that additional concessions will be given when selling, and it is not easy for buyers to "stand up for their rights".
Whether or not the buyers of the houses can be retained is something to be observed
The reporter searched for the property on the Nanjing online real estate website and found that the property was sold in November last year, with a total of 252 units in two buildings. The floor area of the units is 105 square meters, 114 square meters, and 129 square meters, and the average selling price of the fully furnished units is 39843 yuan/㎡.
However, two months have passed, and according to the online real estate, the total number of unsold units in the project is currently 157, accounting for 62.3%, of which 80 units are in Building 8, with a total of 113 unsold units, and 44 units in Building 7 are also unsold, with a total of 33 units sold, accounting for only 13%.
Market people introduced that the "price guarantee agreement" also appeared in Nanjing in 2008.
In August of that year, the property development project Xitang Xiyuan on Huangshan Road in Hexi District launched a “guarantee plan” to attract buyers. The specific content was that “the company solemnly promises that if the discount range of the project is expanded within one year, the company will return the difference to the old owners according to the difference”.
Later, in April 2011, nine property projects in Nanjing also promised to compensate for the difference in price.
“The property market is recovering, and we need a ‘stimulant’ at this time.
"Shen, a senior property developer in Nanjing, said that the "price guarantee agreement" is also one of the marketing methods of property developers.
He believes that developers need more confidence than homebuyers now, and the launch of the "price guarantee agreement" is actually to boost their confidence.
As for whether the buyers will stay, he said it depends on the influence of multiple factors such as the regulatory policies and loan thresholds, and it is still to be observed at present.
Multiple data declines, Taiwan's economy starts the year poorly - www.chinanews.com
Xinhua News Agency Taipei February 11 (Reporters Zhao Bo, Huang Yang) Export trade volume “five consecutive months of decline”, manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) contracted for 7 consecutive months, consumer price index (CPI) saw “three-digit”……Recently, the Taiwan authorities have successively released economic data for January 2023.
Experts analyzed that Taiwan's economy had a poor start to the year, and the growth pressure was not small.
According to the Taiwan authorities' financial affairs department, Taiwan's exports in January this year were US$31.51 billion, down 21.2% year-on-year, and negative growth for the fifth consecutive month.
The export volume of 11 major export commodities fell compared to the same period last year.
The decline in synthetic rubber and its products and optical instruments was the deepest, with annual reductions of 37.6% and 35.7%, respectively.
The export of electronic components decreased by 20.1% year on year, the largest decrease in 11 years.
Among them, the annual decline of integrated circuits was 18.3%, the largest decline in 14 years.
The head of the statistics department, Cai Meina, said that this shows the weakening effect of consumer electronics industry demand, and that the electronics industry is entering a period of adjustment.
Statistics show that in January, imports and exports of Taiwan fell sharply, with outbound exports amounting to only 2.34 billion US dollars, the lowest level in nearly three years.
The Taiwan authorities' financial affairs department believes that global terminal demand has decreased, and the adjustment of the industry has suppressed the willingness of manufacturers to purchase materials. The export slump is unlikely to improve in the short term, and Taiwan's exports in the first quarter of this year are expected to decline more than expected.
According to the Taiwan China Economic Research Institute, the Taiwan Manufacturing Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) was 40.4% in January, down 3.3 percentage points from December last year, and contracted for seven consecutive months.
In the economic monitoring indicator system, the PMI is set at 50%, with an index above 50% representing an expansion of the economy and below 50% representing a contraction.
Among the five components of the Taiwan PMI in January, new orders, production and employment contracted, supplier delivery time decreased, and inventory contracted.
All six industries have returned to the contraction of the PMI, with the order of the contraction speed being the electrical and mechanical equipment industry (35.1%), the electronic and optical industry (35.2%), the chemical and biotechnology and medical industry (39.2%), the basic raw material industry (42.4%), the transportation equipment industry (42.6%) and the food and textile industry (45.7%).
In terms of prices, the Mainland Affairs Council of Taiwan announced that the annual growth rate of CPI in Taiwan in January was 3.04%, which exceeded 3% for the second time since July last year.
Among them, the price of vegetables soared by 28.25%, setting a new high in 17 months.
Cai Zhihong, a special commissioner of the Taiwan "Main Budget Office", frankly admitted that the increase in vegetable prices was beyond expectations, excluding the factors of the Spring Festival. The average CPI in January and February this year should be close to 2.71% of last December, and inflation pressure still exists and is still at a high point.
Looking at Taiwan's economy this year, experts are pessimistic, based on reports from local media such as United Daily News and Yahoo Finance.
Professor Wu Daoren of the Economics Department of Tainan University of Technology analyzed that the decline in exports may cause cash flow problems for export manufacturers, and the risk of debt default will increase.
At the same time, the reduction in orders leads to a reduction in labor costs for manufacturers, which affects the labor market and family economy, and in turn affects consumption capacity.
According to Chiu Dasheng, a researcher at the Taiwan Economic Research Institute, the inflation situation in Europe and the United States has not been resolved, and demand continues to contract. It is estimated that the decline in Taiwan's exports will continue into the first half of the year.
Because Taiwan's economy is supported by exports, it will be affected by the sluggish exports, and its economic growth performance will not be as good as last year.
“An important engine for global recovery” - Xinhua News
“In the face of the COVID-19 epidemic, the Chinese economy has shown great resilience.
Recent market expectations indicate that the international community generally looks forward to China's future development.
"Huilio Liu, a well-known Chinese expert on Spain and an honorary consultant of China Policy Watch, recently told this newspaper's reporter that the current epidemic prevention and control in China has entered a new stage, and the vitality of economic and social development will be further unleashed.
Liu said that in the face of various unexpected factors, China has calmly responded with extraordinary economic governance experience and measures, fully demonstrating its economic resilience and management level.
While China is firmly committed to expanding its opening up to the outside world, the internal driving force of economic development is continuously strengthened, and state-owned enterprises and private enterprises develop in tandem.
Every year, the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference are held in China, where delegates discuss the country's development plans and hot-button issues related to people's livelihoods. They broadly consolidate consensus, unite people's hearts and minds, and pool wisdom, adding strength to China's development.
“Since the reform and opening up, China has achieved long-term high-speed development and has now entered a high-quality development stage.
The international community expects China's wisdom and China's solutions, and expects China's development to bring new opportunities to the world.
"Leo said that China is currently making great efforts to promote technological innovation and inject new impetus into the economic and social development. "Investment, talent cultivation, policy incentives, all of these make China continue to be full of vitality in the new five-year plan."
In the eyes of Leos, economic system reform is a daunting task for any country.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, China has both played the strengths of the market economy and the superiority of the socialist system, and taken active measures to stabilize the economy.
Around the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, we will strengthen financial support for the real economy, support the development of private enterprises, small and medium-sized enterprises, and manufacturing, adhere to innovative development, promote employment, improve the income and living standards of the Chinese people, and meet the diversified consumption needs of the people. China will fully, accurately, and comprehensively implement the new development concept, strive for high-quality development, build a new development pattern, and bring more growth opportunities to the world.
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the proposal of the Belt and Road Initiative.
“The stabilization and recovery of the economy after the epidemic is a common goal of the international community.
China's economic development potential continues to be unleashed, bringing more benefits to countries around the world and becoming an important engine for global recovery.
"Leo said that he looks forward to the continued implementation of the Belt and Road cooperation, which will continue to play an important role in improving the infrastructure level of various countries, strengthening mutual connectivity in various fields, and unleashing greater momentum.

The price of oral implant medical services in Henan Province is standardized and integrated - www.chinanews.com
CCTV News: Dental implants are the ideal choice for many toothless patients, but the price of several thousand yuan per tooth has always deterred many patients.

The emergence of new variables in the Chinese e-commerce industry has brought about a new trend in how to make “content king”.
-China News
CNNEWS, February 11, 2019, “New Variables Emerge in China’s E-commerce Industry, How to Make “Content is King” a Reality in Product Promotion?”
CNBC Reporter Xia Bin
“We entered the e-commerce market late, but from the very beginning, we realized that content is important if you want to stand out from the millions of stores.
Fangfang, a "90s" girl from Guangdong, is now running a health food store on TikTok, allowing a brick-and-mortar store with over 30 years of history to "bloom" online.
Imitating the old Hong Kong film tone and matching it with classic Cantonese songs, open the @Fangfang1 person food TikTok account, the exquisite videos are refreshing to the eyes and ears.
At the recent TikTok e-commerce “Finding Peers·Quality Content Sharing Special Session”, Fangfang, as a representative of quality creators, attended the event to share her experience and insights on daily creative work.
She said on the spot, “The carefully edited video has received a lot of attention from netizens, and many people are interested in the ingredients in my family’s dishes, and want to cook with us. The sales have suddenly opened up.
“
Fangfang used the soup video to make more people fall in love with the taste of “Laoguang”, and a live broadcast sold up to 300,000 pieces of healthy ingredients, saving the family’s old store that was on the verge of bankruptcy.
“No content, no e-commerce”, as short videos and live e-commerce continue to develop, people’s requirements and standards for e-commerce content are entering a new stage.
In the early stages of live broadcasting, live broadcasting rooms often used low price discounts to attract users, and price advantage seemed to be the only selling point at the time.
In recent years, there have been phenomenal KOLs such as Liu Yihong and Dongfang Zhenzhu, as well as many lesser-known influencers and merchants who have emerged in vertical sub-fields. They have improved their long-term business performance by continuously creating high-quality content that matches their brand personality.
According to Gao Yaxian, the head of the operation of Kwai Commerce stars, 6.27 million creators have monetized their content through Kwai Commerce in the past year, and their content creation volume has increased by 252%, and the total transaction amount has more than doubled.
“Behind these numbers, we can feel a thriving author ecosystem with a vibrant vitality.
"Zhao Yaxuan said.
The Communication Innovation and Future Media Experimental Platform of Beijing Normal University previously released the "E-commerce Industry Content Ecosystem Health Index (ECHI) Report", which analyzed the importance of high-quality content in the current e-commerce industry from a data perspective, and evaluated the content ecosystem of 27 mainstream e-commerce platforms in China using the index.
According to the ranking of the e-commerce industry content ecosystem health index in the above report, TikTok e-commerce, Kuaishou, Taobao, Pinduoduo, and JD.com are in the top five.
The report believes that the content ecology in the e-commerce industry is an integrated concept, which is to integrate e-commerce and content, but not all content can be integrated with e-commerce. Good PGC (professional production content) and UGC (user-generated content) are the best carriers for integrating with e-commerce. The higher the value of the content platform, the richer the consumption and promotion scenarios, the higher the possibility of e-commerce integration, the stronger the commercial value, and the higher the proportion of e-commerce content production and consumption in the public and private fields.
On the scene, Professor Yi Guomin, Dean of the School of Journalism and Communication at Beijing Normal University, and Chairman of the China Media Economics and Management Special Committee, gave an analysis and interpretation of the Report.
He said that in terms of content value, the e-commerce industry has transitioned from "consumer accessibility" to "consumer quality" and high-quality, professional, and differentiated content is the "hard currency" of the e-commerce industry.
At the same time, content has become the fundamental and driving force for the new stage of e-commerce development, and PGC content such as knowledge payment, professional knowledge, and KOL (key opinion leaders) has become a standard feature in e-commerce live broadcasts.
Looking at the future development of the e-commerce industry, Cai Guomei put forward two suggestions.
One is from the perspective of improving the content structure, promoting the overall improvement of the health and quality of the e-commerce content ecology, establishing positive content creation and management standards, and realizing the dynamic balance of the e-commerce industry content ecology health system index.
Another is from the perspective of external ecology, which is to achieve the healthy development of the content e-commerce industry and the value coordination and mutual creation of the external environment.
In the future, the e-commerce industry will need more support in terms of data and artificial intelligence to form a prediction of the stability of future development; in addition, it will provide a more standardized and healthy growth space for merchants, achieve the value coordination of enterprises, users, products and services in the e-commerce industry, and create a healthy content ecosystem.

Xinhua News Agency commentator: Promoting Chinese-style modernization is a systematic project - four points to deeply understand the important speech of General Secretary Xi Jinping at the opening ceremony of the seminar on studying and implementing the spirit of the 20th CPC National Congress - www.chinanews.com
Xinhua News Agency Beijing February 11th
Commentator of Xinhua News Agency
“Advancing Chinese modernization is a systematic project that requires comprehensive consideration, systematic planning, and overall promotion. It is necessary to correctly handle the relationship between top-level design and practical exploration, strategy and tactics, adherence to the truth and innovation, efficiency and fairness, vitality and order, self-reliance and openness to the outside world, and other major issues.
At the opening ceremony of the training course for new members, alternate members and leading cadres at the provincial and ministerial level of the Central Committee to study and implement Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era and the spirit of the 20th CPC National Congress, Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, scientifically grasped the laws of modernization construction, profoundly and systematically explained the series of major relationships that need to be handled in practice, and provided us with a scientific methodology to vigorously promote Chinese-style modernization.
Promoting Chinese modernization involves various fields such as economy, politics, culture, society, ecological civilization, and so on. It is related to the governance of the party, the country, and the military, as well as domestic and foreign affairs, national defense, and so on. It is necessary to do systematic planning and be brave in reform and innovation, and continuously achieve overall progress.
In conducting top-level design, it is necessary to have a profound understanding of the trend of world development, accurately grasp the common wishes of the people, deeply explore the laws of economic and social development, and make the planned and policies system reflect the times, grasp the laws, and be creative, so as to achieve unity of near and far, continuity of up and down, and coordination of content.
Promoting Chinese modernization is an exploratory undertaking, and there are many unknown areas that need to be explored in practice, and the development of the cause must be driven by reform and innovation, and must not be stubborn and inflexible.
Strategic issues are fundamental issues for a political party and a country.
To promote Chinese modernization, we must enhance the forward-looking nature of strategies, scientifically predict the future and lead the future; we must enhance the overall nature of strategies, focus on solving major problems that are related to the prosperity and decline of the party and the country, and affect the whole; we must enhance the stability of strategies, once a strategy is formed, it must be adhered to and persisted with for a long time.
It is necessary to scientifically grasp the dialectical unity of strategy and tactics, organically combine the principle of strategy and the flexibility of tactics, be flexible, adaptable, and make quick decisions in a changing environment, and take the initiative in strategy in accordance with local conditions, according to the situation, and according to the trend.
The Chinese nation is a nation that upholds integrity and innovation.
The relationship between upholding the correct direction and innovation should be handled well. We should uphold the essence and source of Chinese modernization, unwaveringly adhere to the characteristics, fundamental requirements, and major principles of Chinese modernization, ensure the correct direction of Chinese modernization, and put innovation in a prominent position in the overall development of the country, conform to the requirements of the times, focus on solving major theoretical and practical problems, actively seek change and adapt to change, vigorously promote reform and innovation, continuously create new momentum and new advantages for development, and fully unleash the creative vitality of the whole society.
Efficiency is an important basis for fairness, and fairness is a powerful guarantee for efficiency.
In promoting Chinese modernization, we must not only create higher efficiency than capitalism, but also more effectively safeguard social fairness, and better achieve the balance between efficiency and fairness, and promote and unify them.
Balancing efficiency and fairness, we will continuously achieve development for the people, development relying on the people, and development results shared by the people, so that the fruits of modernization can benefit more people fairly and equitably.
To promote modernization in the Chinese way, we need to handle the relationship between vitality and order, so that society is both vibrant and orderly.
It is necessary to coordinate the development and security of the country, implement the overall national security concept, build a national security system, strengthen the ability to safeguard national security, and firmly safeguard the security of the state power, system, ideology, and key areas.
While paying more attention to security factors in development, we will strengthen the country's security through development, use the results of development to consolidate the foundation of national security, and create a security environment conducive to economic and social development, continuously unleash the vitality of development, and achieve high-quality development and high-level security.
In promoting Chinese modernization, we must both stick to our own path and broaden our vision of the world, adhere to opening up to the outside world, and continuously expand the breadth and depth of Chinese modernization.
We must adhere to independence, self-reliance, and self-strengthening, put the development of the country and the nation at the starting point of our own strength, and firmly grasp the destiny of the development and progress of our country in our own hands.
We must continuously expand high-level opening-up to the outside world, deeply participate in the global industrial division of labor and cooperation, make good use of both domestic and international resources, expand the development space of Chinese modernization, and share development opportunities and create a better future in mutual benefit and win-win.
By following the path, we can achieve great things.
Under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, and under the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, we should grasp the laws, be diligent in our work, fully display our positive energy, initiative, and creativity, correctly handle a series of major issues, and strive to make new achievements in the new journey of comprehensively building a socialist modernized country, and continuously open up new horizons in the modernization of China.
The Biden administration will blacklist six Chinese entities suspected of involvement in the spy balloon program on Friday (February 10).
The US Department of Commerce said that the five Chinese companies and one research institution helped modernize the Chinese military, especially in aerospace projects, including airships and aircraft.
It is very difficult for companies on the blacklist to obtain technology exports from the United States.
The list is called the "entity list", and companies listed on it will not be able to purchase technology or goods from US suppliers unless they obtain special export licenses from the US Department of Commerce.
The companies listed on the blacklist are: Beijing Nangong Aerospace Science and Technology Co., Ltd., China Electronics Technology Group No. 48 Research Institute, Dongguan Lingkong Remote Sensing Technology Co., Ltd., Yingmen Aviation Science and Technology Group Co., Ltd., Guangzhou Tianhai Xing Aviation Science and Technology Co., Ltd., and Shanxi Yingmen Aviation Science and Technology Group Co., Ltd.
Previously, the White House said it was considering taking broader measures to "expose and address" China's larger-scale surveillance activities that threaten U.S. national security.
The balloon incident further strained relations between China and the United States, and US Secretary of State Blinken canceled his visit to China.
The United States shot down a balloon on February 4, and the Chinese government made a serious representation to the US embassy in China, criticizing the United States for seriously undermining and damaging the efforts and progress of both sides to stabilize Sino-US relations.
Based on the existing debris evidence and information from the Chinese military's procurement platform, the US government concluded that the manufacturer of the balloon "has a direct relationship with the Chinese People's Liberation Army" and is an approved supplier of the Chinese military.
At a press conference on Friday, Ma Ning, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said that China has explained the situation and clarified its position on the accidental entry of a Chinese unmanned aerial vehicle into the US airspace due to force majeure.
According to the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, she added that the relevant resolutions of the US Congress are purely political manipulation and hype.
China strongly opposes this and firmly opposes it.
Matthew Axelrod, the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Enforcement, said: "Today's action demonstrates the joint efforts we have made to identify and stop China's use of spy balloons, which have violated the airspace of the United States and more than 40 countries.
“
Reuters reported that an employee of Guangzhou Tianhai Xiang Aviation Science and Technology Co., Ltd. said he was not aware of the sanctions and refused to comment further.
The Chinese Embassy in the United States and the Chinese Consulate General in New York have not yet commented on this information.

(Deutsche Welle Chinese) It has been several days since the earthquake hit parts of Turkey and Syria, and the hope of finding survivors is fading. However, the rescue of a family of five on Saturday has brought great relief to the rescue team.
According to the Associated Press, in the hard-hit town of Nourdai in Gaziantep province, this family of five was successfully rescued after being trapped under the rubble for more than five days.
Rescue workers first pulled out the mother and daughter from the rubble, and then found the father, but he insisted on rescuing his son and another daughter first.
When they were all rescued, the crowd cheered.
In the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaraş, a 16-year-old boy and a 70-year-old woman were successfully rescued in harsh cold weather conditions.
“What day is it today?”
"——The boy trapped under the rubble for 129 hours asked the rescuers who brought him back to the ground.
A man from Kacharmanarash holds the cat he just rescued
The miraculous success of the rescue operation has brought a glimmer of hope to the search and rescue work, which was already bleak, but at the same time, the number of fatalities is still on the rise.
According to official statistics, the earthquake on Monday has caused more than 20,000 deaths in Turkey, and the death toll in neighboring Syria is estimated to be more than 3,500.
Although experts say that people can survive for more than a week after being trapped in the rubble, the hope of finding more survivors has become increasingly bleak.
Rescue workers are still using thermal imaging devices to search for signs of life under the rubble.
At the same time, the focus of the rescue efforts began to shift towards helping the survivors who were in desperate need of assistance.
UN Official: Disaster in the region "unprecedented in a century"
Martin Griffiths, the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, said at a press conference in Turkey that the earthquake was the "worst disaster in the region in a century."
He also praised Turkey's response to the disaster as "unusual".
He also told Reuters reporters that he hopes to provide aid to areas controlled by the Syrian government and the opposition, but also said that the matter is "not yet clear."
The United Nations has pledged an additional $25 million in relief aid to the people of the earthquake-stricken areas of Syria.
Earlier this week, the United Nations announced that it would allocate $25 million to relief efforts in Turkey and Syria.

When the earthquake occurred, a fault line between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate ruptured near the William Prince Bay, near the Academy Bay.
In most areas, the earthquake lasted from 3 to 5 minutes.
The displacement of the seabed triggered a huge tsunami, with a height of 67 meters.
Because it was a holiday, schools and many businesses were closed.
This earthquake ultimately resulted in the deaths of 139 people.
Of these, 9 people died directly from the earthquake, and another 130 died from the tsunami caused by the earthquake.

A total of 14 countries along the Pacific coast were affected, with the most severely affected areas including Aceh Province in Indonesia, Chiang Mai and Phuket tourist areas in Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Tamil Nadu in India.
At that time, it was the peak tourist season for Christmas, and the affected areas were crowded with a large number of tourists and local residents. This led to many tourists enjoying their holidays on the beach and local people working on the seaside being swept away by the tsunami, making many people missing in this earthquake.
It is estimated that the number of fatalities and missing persons is at least 300,000.
The most destructive earthquake in the world in the past 60 years

About 22,000 people died in the disaster, and about 400,000 buildings were completely destroyed or collapsed.
The Fukushima I nuclear power plant suffered a leakage accident due to the influence of the earthquake and tsunami.
This accident was classified as the most serious level 7 on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES).
The Fukushima nuclear accident has caused trace amounts of radioactive substances to be detected worldwide, including iodine-131 and cesium-137 (half-life of 30 years).
A large amount of radioactive isotopes were released into the Pacific Ocean as a result of the nuclear accident.
According to the United Nations, at least 870,000 people in the disaster areas of Syria and Turkey are in urgent need of food.
In Syria alone, as many as 5.3 million people have lost their homes due to earthquakes.
The World Food Programme (WFP) has called for $77 million to provide food for people displaced by the earthquake in Turkey and Syria.
The temperature in the disaster area is currently as low as minus 10 degrees, and many disaster victims have no place to live.
The Turkish government has distributed a large number of hot meals, tents, and blankets, but these supplies are still difficult to reach many people in urgent need of help.
In Syria, which has been mired in civil war for 12 years, the earthquake has made the plight of the people even worse.
Within four days of the earthquake, the World Food Programme had provided food relief to 115,000 people in Turkey and Syria.
The World Health Organization (WHO) sent 72 tons of medical supplies for trauma treatment and emergency surgery.

Google AI chatbot "answering the wrong questions" causes the parent company's stock price to evaporate by billions of dollars
(Combined report on the 11th)
Google's newly launched artificial intelligence chatbot Bard has suffered a setback, "answering the wrong questions" in a promotional video, causing the share price of Google's parent company Alphabet to plummet by 8.9% on Wednesday, falling below the $100 mark, wiping out $110 billion (about RM47.65 billion) in market value, and closing at $94.57 on Friday.
The market is worried that Alphabet is not as competitive as its rival Microsoft.
According to a report by Reuters, Google released an advertising short film about its AI chatbot Bard on social media earlier. In the film, someone asks Bard: "Can you tell me what new discoveries about the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) can I tell my 9-year-old child?"
Bard mentioned in his response that the telescope had taken the first photo of a planet outside the solar system.
However, according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States, the first photo of an exoplanet was taken by the Very Large Telescope of the European Southern Observatory in 2004.
Reuters reported on the topic of "Alphabet's stock price plunged after Bard's incorrect response."
On the other hand, Google pointed out that Bard's response "emphasizes the importance of a rigorous testing process," and will combine external feedback with its own internal testing to ensure that Bard's response "meets high standards based on quality, safety, and authentic information."
Singapore's tourism industry is recovering strongly, with inbound tourists increasing 19 times over 2021
(Comprehensive report on the 11th) The Singapore Tourism Board recently announced that the number of international tourists visiting Singapore is expected to reach 12 million to 14 million in 2023, bringing about tourism benefits of about 18 billion to 21 billion new dollars; the number of tourists and tourism revenue will recover to about 67% to 75% of the level before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019; the possibility of the tourism industry achieving full recovery in 2024 is very high.
The Singapore tourism market will gradually restart and recover in 2022.
The latest statistics released by the Singapore Tourism Board show that the number of inbound tourists increased 19 times from 330,600 in 2021 to 6.3 million in 2022, exceeding the earlier estimate of 40 million to 60 million by the Tourism Board.
From January to September 2022, Singapore's tourism revenue totaled 8.96 billion new dollars. It is expected that the tourism revenue for the whole year of 2022 can reach 13.8 billion to 14.3 billion new dollars, which is 6 to 7 times higher than 1.89 billion new dollars in 2021, and has already recovered to about 50% to 52% of the level before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019.
The Singapore government is taking multiple measures to accelerate the recovery of the tourism industry.
In April 2022, the government announced that it would allocate nearly 500 million new dollars to stimulate the tourism industry's recovery.
The Tourism Bureau recently announced that it plans to allocate 110 million New Zealand dollars from this budget over the next two years to launch more commercial and leisure activities to attract tourists to return.
In order to make health and wellness one of the highlights of Singapore's tourism, the Singapore Tourism Board released an expression of interest call on November 23, 2022, planning to develop a health and wellness destination on the southern coast of Singapore.
Wang Lingli, the Executive Director of Sports and Health Tourism of the Singapore Tourism Board, said that in recent years, more and more tourists have placed their physical health at the top of their considerations.
Developing a health and wellness destination in the southern part of the Bay South area, which includes the Bay South Garden and the Bay South Embankment, is expected to contribute to Singapore's tourism and economy, allowing tourists to spend more time and stay longer in Singapore.
Singapore Tourism Board Chairman, Mr. Chang Beng Long, said that health and wellness will become an important component of Singapore's tourism products in the coming years.
The COVID-19 pandemic has increased public awareness and demand for physical and mental health.
To this end, the Tourism Bureau has been promoting health and wellness projects to the local public and international tourists over the past two years.
In June 2022, the Singapore Tourism Board held the first Health and Wellness Festival, providing the public with more than 130 types of health activities and experiences.
Singapore will continue to provide new travel experiences for tourists.
In addition to the newly opened Singapore Children's Museum, the Avatar World in Sentosa, the St. Andrew's Central Beach Market, the "Explore New Horizons" exhibition added by the Art Science Museum, and the outdoor theater newly built by the Night Safari, the Tourism Board will support the development and update of projects such as the Flying Bird Park of the Wildlife World, making Singapore an attractive international travel destination.
According to the plan, Singapore will establish relevant industry standards for the sustainable development of the conference, exhibition and incentive tourism industry within 2023, and focus on improving the problems of waste treatment and carbon emissions, further optimizing the tourism environment.
The recovery of Singapore's tourism industry has accelerated the recovery of the aviation industry.
Data shows that as of December 18, 2022, Changi Airport's passenger traffic has rebounded strongly, with daily passenger traffic reaching 150,000, weekly passenger traffic reaching about 1 million, accounting for about 75% of the pre-epidemic level, and the number of airline employees on duty has also recovered to about 90% of the pre-epidemic level.
Data shows that from January to October 2022, Singapore has received 23.6 million tourists, accounting for 42% of the pre-pandemic period, and 170,000 flights have taken off and landed, accounting for 53% of the pre-pandemic period.
The tourism industry has quickly recovered, which has also driven the recovery of the accommodation, transportation, catering, and shopping industries.
The Singapore government and the tourism industry have high hopes for the Chinese market.
According to Khor Suet-Dan, Assistant Director of the International Division of the Singapore Tourism Board, a survey by a Chinese travel platform showed that Singapore's safety index ranked among the top three in the world, which is one of the reasons why Singapore is so popular with Chinese tourists.
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, about 3.6 million people traveled to Singapore for vacation every year.
As China relaxes its border policies, it is expected that the number of Chinese tourists will recover to 30% to 60% of the number in 2019 this year.
Qiu Shudan pointed out that in the future, the Tourism Bureau will closely monitor the signals released by China on its outbound travel policies to cope with changes in tourist demand.
In addition to strengthening partnerships with Chinese online travel platforms and travel agencies such as Ctrip, the Singapore Tourism Board will actively prepare to receive Chinese tourists in response to new trends in overseas travel in China.
Looking ahead to the tourism market in 2023, the Singapore Tourism Board is confident that the tourism industry will recover faster than expected, as long as there is no significant recession affecting public income, and there are no new large-scale fatal epidemics.
Kim Jong-un and his daughter interact closely, while his wife is neglected
(Comprehensive report on the 11th) North Korea held a military parade to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Army on the evening of the 8th. Kim Jong-un's daughter, Kim Ju-ae, not only attended the parade, but also stood on the podium with her father.

In the official photo, Kim Ju-ae not only sat in the middle of her parents, which is rare, but also stood on the podium with Kim Jong-un at the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Army on the following evening.
The North Korean state media, KCTV, released footage of the parade afterward, exposing more scenes of deep father-daughter love.
Kim Jong-un looked at his daughter several times from the podium, and their smiles never faded. They whispered to each other in their ears, and Kim Jong-un once held up his father's cheeks with both hands, and Kim Jong-un responded with a bright smile.
Other official media images also show that the master's wife was sitting on an indoor sofa with Kim Jong-un, constantly touching her father's face with her hand; and when she was walking with her father, she was touching Kim Jong-un's chest with her hand.
Meanwhile, the first lady, Liu Xia, had to walk behind or sit aside, always a few steps away from her husband and daughter.
South Korean media pointed out that since the first public appearance of Kim Jong-un after the test launch of the Hwasong-17 missile on November 18 last year, the probability of exposure has been increasing for three months, and it has appeared in formal occasions for the fifth time so far.
The North Korean state media referred to Kim Jong-un as the beloved son, the noble son, etc., and broadcasted a segment of Kim Jong-un repeatedly shouting his pledge to die for his pure bloodline while overlooking the parade from the stands.
These signs have led outsiders to question whether Kim Jong-un has already been predetermined as the successor to the Kim regime. The Washington Post analyzed that "this is a signal from Kim Jong-un to push his daughter, who is in middle school, to the position of successor," but there are also views that this judgment is still premature, and there are still possibilities in the situation where Kim Jong-un has a son.
Zhongyang Q&A | How to view the unexpectedly strong January non-farm employment data in the United States and the future trend - Economic Observer Network - a professional financial news website
Q: How does Reignwood Investment view the unexpectedly strong January non-farm employment data in the United States and the future trend?
On February 3, the US Department of Labor released the non-farm employment data for January 2023, with 517,000 new non-farm jobs, significantly higher than the market expectation of 189,000; the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, the lowest in nearly 50 years; the hourly wage growth rate was 4.4%, the month-on-month growth rate was 0.3%, slightly slowing down.
In terms of the overall data, there are many one-time and technical factors that affect this data, such as the return of striking teachers, the revision of the survey and statistical scope, and the update of the seasonal factor. In the future, there may be some adjustments (refer to the downward adjustment from 504,000 to 364,000 in January 2022), and non-agricultural employment may not be as strong as the data shows.
In terms of structure, the impact of layoffs in high-tech enterprises is still significant, but the proportion is relatively low; the high-contact service industries such as leisure hotels, education and healthcare have seen a significant increase in employment, and the data shows that the labor shortage in the service industry still exists.
Combining the equally unexpectedly strong service PMI, job vacancy and labor shortage data, and the strong data on consumer credit, we judge that the US service industry has experienced rapid recovery after the extreme weather and holidays.
We believe that the tight supply and demand in the US employment market cannot be improved without a recession.
There is still a supply gap of more than 5 million in the US labor market, and the labor participation rate is slow to rise, especially the labor participation rate of 25-54 year olds has already approached the pre-epidemic high point.
In addition, due to the strong savings and consumer credit of US residents, the strong demand for consumption will further delay the impact of contractionary policies on the employment market.
The continued tight supply and demand in the US employment market will be the backdrop of the US economy in 2023.
With the current interest rate hike nearing its end and inflation expectations constantly fluctuating, we are not optimistic about the continued decline in wage growth.
Before this data release, the US stock bond foreign exchange market was too optimistic about the Fed's interest rate hike path.
As inflation data continues to improve, the Fed has been able to balance the fragile inflation expectations of the market while shortening the pace of interest rate hikes. However, the market has ignored the Fed's hawkish stance, expecting not only an early end to interest rate hikes but also two rate cuts by the end of the year.
In the case of a tight labor market and an unclear impact of contractionary policies, we believe that the Fed's guidance on rate hikes at the end of the year is relatively reasonable. The adjustment of extreme market expectations and the congestion of trading may cause some harm to the market.
Despite this, the stubbornness of wage growth is hard to change the current trend of rapid decline in inflation. With the M2 data turning negative year-on-year and the gradual improvement of various CPI sub-items, the US CPI data has been turning to a period of rapid decline since October. The stubbornness of wage growth will only provide a buffer for future inflation data, and the current market expectation is difficult to be falsified. After the next inflation data is released, the market may enter a new round of competition.
The founder of Sun Sun, Zheng Yonggang, passed away due to sudden heart disease. He once led the transformation of China's first listed clothing company - Economic Observer Network - a professional financial news website
On February 11, a WeChat public account certified by Shenshen Holdings Limited Company (hereinafter referred to as "Shenshen Holdings") issued an announcement. Shenshen Holdings founder and chairman Zeng Yongqiang died on February 10, 2023, at the age of 65, due to sudden heart disease.
In the 1980s, Zheng Yonggang served as the head of a state-owned cotton spinning factory. With his transfer, in 1989, Zheng Yonggang became the head of Ningbo Yunhong Garment General Factory, the predecessor of Sunsun Group.
In December 2022, at the 20th China Enterprise Leaders Annual Meeting and the 22nd China Enterprise Future Stars Annual Meeting, Zheng Yonggang said in his speech that in the Chinese suit market in the 1990s, the market share of the Sunsun brand was as high as 37%.
Shanshui Stock (600884.SH) was listed in 1996, becoming the first listed company in the Chinese clothing industry.
At a time when the garment industry was booming, Suning Group began to transform, because Zeng Yonggang realized that "once the market is liberalized, Chinese brands will naturally form a tiered brand market, and Suning Suit cannot always be the leader, and it is unlikely to become the national suit for a long time."
In 1999, Suning began to research corporate transformation. Zheng Yonggong recalled that year, “We came to Shanghai to find out what to do with the transformation, and we specially invited a lot of experts and scholars to hold some Zhuge Liang meetings and Taoyuan seminars.
Finally, we have set two major strategic directions.
The first direction is new energy and new materials, and the other is big health with a future.
After the strategic direction was determined, Sunsun began to look for cooperation. At that time, the Anthracite Research Institute of Shenyang Steel was doing the National 863 Project, and the research funds were not enough, so Sunsun and the Anthracite Research Institute of Shenyang Steel signed a cooperation agreement to jointly promote the industrialization of the National 863 Project “Intermediate Phase Carbon Microspheres”, engage in the research, production and sales of negative materials, and promote the commercialization of negative materials in the domestic market.
In 2001, Shanshui achieved the mass production of intermediate-sized graphite spheres, and began to replace Japanese products, becoming the main supplier of intermediate-sized graphite spheres in the domestic market.
This is the first lithium-ion battery negative material production enterprise in China, which has achieved the localization of lithium-ion battery negative materials.
As the application of lithium batteries rapidly spread, the lithium battery business of Shanshan began to gradually develop. In 2007, the lithium material business was written into the main business of Shanshan. The proportion of revenue from the clothing business decreased year by year, until 2013, the revenue from the lithium material business of Shanshan completely surpassed the revenue from the clothing business.
In February 2021, Shanshui Stock successfully acquired the LG Chem polarizer business, entering the LCD polarizer market, and established Shanshui Optoelectronics, a polarizer company. The technology content in this field is relatively high, and Shanshui's main competitors are all in the Fortune Global 500, such as Samsung in South Korea, Sumitomo Chemical in Japan, and JTEKT.
Zheng Yonggang once shared his experience in post-investment management, “China’s private enterprises acquire some high-tech enterprises internationally, but the success rate is relatively low. Why do these acquisitions fail?
Because everyone will consider it, I spent so much money, I have to send someone to manage it, this is a common behavior, ” however, Zheng Yonggang is different, on the day when Suntak was successfully acquired, Zheng Yonggang announced in front of Suntak, Suntak, as a major shareholder of Suntak, decided to implement a one-company two-systems, except for Zheng Yonggang serving as the chairman, the people of Suntak Enterprise will not be sent to Suntak, and adopt the mode of authorized management, the existing distribution system, corporate culture, various management models remain unchanged.
ICC Xintong Information released the negative electrode data for 2022, showing that the negative electrode of Shanshan exceeded 200,000 tons in 2022, with a year-on-year increase of 100%, accounting for 16% of the market share, and the negative electrode material of artificial graphite ranked first in the market.
In the polarizing film business, Yano Research statistics show that the global market share of SungKyun Light Electronics, a subsidiary of the company, reached 29% in 2022, and it is expected to reach 32% in 2023, continuing to rank first in the global market.
In the first three quarters of 2022, the revenue of Shanshui Pharmaceutical was 15.841 billion yuan, and the net profit was 2.313 billion yuan. On February 10, the share price of Shanshui Pharmaceutical was 19.24 yuan/share, and the total market value was 43.6 billion yuan.
On February 9, Sunsun shares said on the interactive platform that by the end of 2022, the company's graphitization effective capacity will be about 100,000 tons, and the graphitization capacity of the Meishan project is still in the process of climbing.
According to Wandi, Zheng Yonggang is still the chairman and actual controller of Shanshui Stock.
Tianyancha shows that Zheng Yonggang holds a total shareholding proportion of 40.1% in Shensheng Holdings Limited.
The general manager of Sunsun shares is Li Zhixia, born in 1968, who has served as the chairman of Dongguan Sunsun Battery Materials Co., Ltd., Ningbo Sunsun New Materials Science and Technology Co., Ltd., Hunan Sunsun Energy Technology Co., Ltd., and the deputy general manager of Ningbo Sunsun Shares Co., Ltd.
On February 10, Sunsun shares said on the investor interaction platform that there is no blood relationship between the senior management of the company and the actual controller of the company.
“Fund E account” has arrived: the CSRC authorizes the development of the collection and query of all funds under investors’ names - Economic Observer Network - a professional financial news website
Economic Observer
Always forgetting the "petty cash"?
These problems of the base people will soon be solved.
On February 10, the CSRC announced that the "Fund E Account" APP was launched in various mobile application stores and underwent public testing.
It was introduced that the “Fund E Account” provides a “one-stop” query service for public fund accounts and share information for individual investors, aiming to solve the pain points of forgetting accounts, querying is cumbersome, etc. for a large number of small investors.
According to Wind data, by the end of 2022, there were 156 public fund management companies in China, managing fund assets of about 2.6 trillion yuan; there were 167 public fund share registration institutions and 411 public fund sales institutions.
The account systems of each share registration institution are independent of each other, and there is no unified query channel in the industry.
According to industry insiders, at the end of 2021, there were more than 720 million fund investors in China, which means that half of the country's population invested in fund products.
Previously, investors needed to inquire about their purchase through different sales institutions, but through the “Fund E Account”, they can inquire about their purchase through all sales channels, and their fund holding status is clear at a glance.
What is the “Fund E Account” app?
According to the relevant documents, the “Fund E Account” APP is a public fund industry portal mobile application developed and built by China Clearing Co., Ltd. with the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission. It can provide investors with a one-stop query of the off-market shareholding of all public fund products in the market.
Investors can conveniently and quickly obtain information about the offshore shareholdings of publicly offered fund products under the management of various fund managers through the "Fund E Account", which can comprehensively improve the efficiency of inquiries.
Specifically, the information that investors can query through the "Fund E Account" includes: fund account information opened at all public fund management institutions, transaction account information opened at public fund sales institutions, and the off-exchange shareholding of products such as publicly offered securities investment funds and collective asset management plans established by securities companies, which do not limit the number of investors to 200.
Liu Yichen, the business manager of the Shanghai Securities Fund Evaluation Research Center, told the reporter of Economic Observer that investors can know the holdings of all offshore public funds through the "Fund E Account" App, which helps them find "forgotten assets", and more importantly, it helps customers collect comprehensive information on their fund investment across all accounts, which helps customers better understand their own investment situation in a more timely, accurate, and complete manner, and thus better optimize their own fund portfolio and better plan their own financial arrangements.
How to register and use it?
The reporter noticed that the "Fund E Account" APP has been uploaded to the application stores of Huawei, Apple, Xiaomi, OPPO, vivo, etc., but the APP is still in the public trial operation stage, and registration requires filling in an invitation code, which investors can obtain by contacting the fund management company of the fund they hold.
A customer service person from a large public fund in Shanghai provided a six-digit invitation code to the reporter of Economic Observer, and told the reporter, “During the trial operation of the APP, China Clearing provides a certain number of invitation codes to each fund manager, which investors can obtain by calling us. We will provide them.
After the trial operation is over, the invitation code will no longer be needed when registering open users.
“
The reporter registered an account and completed a search by downloading and using the relevant documents of the "E account" of the fund under the disclosure of the CSRC official website. The whole process only took a few minutes and was mainly divided into four steps: user registration, real name authentication, bonding of the fund account, and public fund search.
After the real-name authentication step, click the "Asset" fund binding button. All fund products purchased by the reporter through various fund sales platforms will appear in the binding option list (can be bound to an account). After binding, you can directly see the total assets of the fund you invested in and can start using the query function.
It is worth noting that the “Fund E account” only provides query services for investors and cannot conduct redemption and trading.
The data displayed in the "Fund E account" is generally the date of the user's query (T day) plus three trading days.
For example, on February 10, when you open the "Fund E account", the total assets, fund shares, and net asset value displayed on the asset page correspond to the three trading days before that date, that is, February 7.

The United States, Japan, and the Philippines have reached a consensus on defense against the CCP
Asia - On February 9, Philippine President Bongbong Marcos visited Japan and met with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Both sides agreed to oppose the CCP's infringement on the South China Sea and the East China Sea. After the meeting, the leaders of the Philippines and Japan issued a joint statement, saying that they would sign a trilateral defense agreement with the United States to conduct substantive defense exchanges and oppose the CCP's hegemonic policy.
According to Japanese media, Kishida wants to use this meeting to help Japan and the Philippines establish policies to deal with the Taiwan Strait crisis.
Xiaomakos visited China in early January this year and obtained an agreement worth 20 billion US dollars.
However, after that, Sino-Philippine relations not only did not improve, but actually deteriorated.
Earlier this month, the Philippines signed an agreement with the United States to open more bases to the US military and to ensure the security of the South China Sea.
The newly added base is located 300 kilometers from Taiwan and is the closest place to China.
If a crisis occurs in Taiwan, the US military may launch operations from its base in the Philippines.
Japanese media believe that Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, and even the Philippines have formed an axis with the United States, building a "counter-China arc" in the Western Pacific to promote regional cooperation.
The Vice Chairman of the Kuomintang, Xia Litian, conveyed the message of Song Tao to China during his visit: welcome the Green Camp to visit Taiwan under the 92 Consensus
This time, the Vice Chairman of the Kuomintang Party of China in Taiwan, Xia Lijun, met with the Director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the Communist Party of China, Song Tao, and the Member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China, Wang Huning.
Zhao Chunshan, a senior advisor to the Kuomintang's official agency, the Guomindang National Foundation, was interviewed by the Taiwan Central News Agency last night. He actively praised Song Tao's statement to Xia Litian, saying that as long as they recognize the "92 Consensus" and oppose Taiwan independence, China welcomes Green Party people to visit the mainland.
The Kuomintang side evaluates it as a new thing.
The meeting between Xia Lijian and Song Tao earlier in the day was not mentioned in the news report.
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party in Taiwan has been clarifying its rejection of the "92 Consensus" for days.
According to Central News Agency today, the Vice Chairman of the Kuomintang, Xia Lijun, led a delegation to visit the mainland. During their stay in Beijing, they met with Wang Huning, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, and the new Director of the Taiwan Affairs Office, Song Tao, and the Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, Yin Li.
When Shi Lijian met with Song Tao, they discussed the political basis of the national consensus and anti-Taiwan independence. Zhao Chunshan, a senior advisor of the National Party's National Government Fund, said in the meeting that the National Party's national consensus was the original "national consensus".
Zhao Chunshan analyzed that this was different from the previous meetings he had participated in.
In recent video conferences with the academic community on the mainland, as well as this one, I have not heard any scholars talk about the use of force and the "anti-secession law", but rather about the resumption of exchanges and dialogue.
Zhao Chunshan pointed out that the situation on both sides of the Taiwan Strait is dangerous, and the mainland hopes to convey its intention to improve relations through the Kuomintang.
Because there is no mutual trust between the CCP and the KMT, the other party still wants to do a good job of working with Taiwanese people, and the representative does not want to ruin the relationship between the two sides.
According to Zhao Chunshan, Wang Huning also personally instructed Song Tao to "implement the demands of the Taiwanese farmers and fishermen", and if it is not possible to solve the problem comprehensively, it should be handled on a case-by-case basis.
The report did not mention whether the KMT people mentioned the daily harassment of Taiwan by Chinese military aircraft and warships when they visited the mainland, the agricultural and fishery problems of some counties and cities in Taiwan, and whether the reporters from Central News Agency asked such questions.
The Federation of Trade Unions once again mobilizes a large-scale demonstration against the government's retirement reform plan
On Saturday (February 11), the French trade unions launched a nationwide mobilization against the government's draft retirement pension reform, calling on the public to take to the streets to express their opinions.
This is the fourth day of social protests against the draft reform of the government pension system.
The number of people who respond to the call for a rally may affect the next action plan of the trade union group.
This is the fourth time that the eight major trade unions in France have jointly launched a nationwide mobilization in a month, and it is the first time that the protest activities have been scheduled for Saturday.
Since Saturday is a day off for most French people, they do not need to choose between participating in demonstrations and strikes, and the trade union groups therefore hope that today's rally will attract more people to participate.
The unions of the public transport system, subway, and public railway companies did not call for a strike today, and the public transport system should be able to operate normally. Citizens can take the subway to the rally venue, and people in areas where schools start winter vacation can go on a normal vacation.
The trade union group hopes that more than one million people will participate in the rally today, while the police expect the number of participants nationwide to be between 600,000 and 800,000, and 90,000 to 120,000 people may gather in the Paris city center.
Since the beginning of the protests against the government's retirement reform plan, although opinion polls show that most French people do not support measures to delay the legal retirement age from the current 62 to 64, the number of people who have actually taken to the streets to participate in the demonstrations has gradually decreased.
The first strike demonstration on January 31 gathered 1.27 million to 2.5 million people nationwide.
The number of protesters on Tuesday (February 7) has shrunk to between 757,000 and 2 million people nationwide.
This retirement pension reform plan is currently being discussed in the French National Assembly.
In the opposition, especially the opposition parties led by the radical left, have submitted countless amendment proposals, which has slowed down the deliberation process.
The debates between the two sides are becoming more intense and acrimonious.
A member of the French Resistance Party, a left-wing political party, recently posted a picture of himself stepping on a balloon with the image of the Minister of Labor on social media, which triggered protests from the ruling party.
The Speaker of the National Assembly finally announced a ban on the member from participating in parliamentary activities for 15 days as a punishment for this behavior.
Although this reform plan has triggered the largest social movement in France in recent 20 years, so far, the government has made some adjustments to the draft, but has not made any major concessions.
The trade union has already prepared to launch another action on Thursday next week, March 16th. On March 7th, when the reform draft was sent to the Senate for discussion, the trade union also plans to organize demonstration actions.
China encourages higher birth rates, donor sperm for college students
The Human Sperm Bank of Yunnan Province, China, issued an announcement on the 9th, inviting those with a college degree or above or students to donate sperm, and those who donate 8 to 12 times can receive a subsidy of 4,500 yuan.
According to Taiwanese media reports today, the news went viral on Weibo on the day it was released, and triggered follow-up initiatives in many provinces and cities, including Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hubei, Shandong, and Beijing.
According to a report by the Free Times, China encourages university students to donate sperm.
The donation of sperm is highest in Beijing, and in addition to academic qualifications, it also requires a height of 170 cm or above, facial features in proportion, no obvious hair loss, and near-sightedness not exceeding 600 degrees.
According to the report, the Yunnan Provincial Human Sperm Bank stated that donors can receive a full set of male reproductive health examinations worth 1,000 yuan, “especially sperm and chromosome testing, which most people have never done before, is of great significance in understanding their reproductive status”.
The conditions for sperm donors include being taller than 165 cm, having a college degree or above, having no color blindness or hepatitis B, and having no genetic or infectious diseases.
According to a report by China Tianmu News, the Shaanxi Provincial Human Sperm Bank has posted an advertisement that reads, “Donate sperm for money, it is an endless honor,” calling on young people to donate sperm and encouraging netizens to forward related messages, “to let love spread.”
The price in Shaanxi is higher than that in Yunnan. Eligible donors can receive 300 yuan in cash each time, and those who have donated a certain number of times can receive a subsidy of 5,000 yuan.
The highest subsidy currently known is in Beijing, with a subsidy of 5,150 yuan.
The last communist prime minister of East Germany has passed away
The successor of the East German Communist Party reported in a statement that "last night, Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95.
Therefore, our party has lost an important leader.
“
On November 13, 1989, four days after the Berlin Wall, which had separated East Berlin and West Berlin for 28 years, was opened, Modrow said he would help turn East Germany into a democratic country.
At that time, the leaders of the Communist Party were forced to step down due to protests by demonstrators in all parts of East Germany demanding democracy and freedom.
After Gorbachev came to power in the Soviet Union, he called for changes in Eastern Europe, which was dominated by the Soviet Union.
In March 1990, Modrow announced the first and only free election in the German Democratic Republic (GDR).
The election results led to him no longer serving as the Prime Minister.
Although Mubarak carried out reforms, opponents accused him of trying to delay political change and unification that occurred in October 1990.
He has also been criticized for trying to reform the secret police instead of abolishing it.
In 1993, Mordor was found guilty of electoral fraud in the municipal elections of May 1989, but he did not go to prison.
Some have claimed that these allegations are politically motivated.
From 1990 to 1994, Modrow continued to serve in the German parliament and served as a member of the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
Modro sees himself as a reformer and hopes to change the Communist Party from within.
In 1999, he told Reuters that he did not want the old East Germany to return, but said that the achievements of East Germany should be recognized.
Modrow was born in 1928 in the then German town of Jasenitz (now Jasienica in Poland), and received training as a mechanic.
During World War II, he served as a sergeant in the youth fire department and, as the conflict was coming to an end, became a member of the Nazi militia organization Volkssturm, which called on men aged 16 to 60 to join the final struggle.
When he was 17, Modrow was captured by the Soviet army and taken as a prisoner of war to the Soviet Union, where he took part in anti-Fascist courses and became a committed Communist.
In 1949, the year that East Germany was established, he returned to his homeland and found a job as a mechanic, and continued to study social sciences and economics, and earned a doctorate.
Modrow was a member of the Free German Youth Movement, which almost all young people in East Germany joined, and rose to become the chairman of the Dresden region party through the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED) from 1973 to 1989.
He also served in the East German parliament for more than 30 years.
In 1990, Modrow became the de facto leader of East Germany and held the highest state office.
Iran marks revolution anniversary, hackers who support protests terrify presidential TV speech
The Islamic Republic of Iran held an official gathering to commemorate the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution on Saturday, but anti-government hackers briefly interrupted President Ebrahim Raisi's televised speech.
The president's live televised speech was interrupted on the Internet for about a minute, and a group of black hat hackers against the Iranian government appeared on the screen, whose name was "Edalat Ali (Ali Justice)".
There was also a voice shouting "Death to the Islamic Republic".
According to a report by Reuters today, hackers interrupted the broadcast of the state television station on the anniversary of the Iranian Revolution.
Iran's hardline government is facing the most audacious challenge yet from young protesters demanding their ouster as the country marks the 44th anniversary of the Iranian revolution, but Raisi is still calling on "deceived youth" to repent so they can receive pardon from the country's top leaders.
Protests continue to sweep across Iran after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in custody of the country's morality police in September.
The Iranian security forces have carried out deadly repression against protest activities, which is one of the strongest challenges faced by the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution overthrew the 2,500-year monarchy.
As part of the commemoration of the anniversary of the revolutionary amnesty, the Iranian authorities released the imprisoned dissident Farhad Mesami and the Iranian-French scholar Fariba Adelkhah on Friday, who had been on hunger strike.
Earlier, the highest leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued an amnesty decree, which includes some prisoners arrested in recent anti-government protests.
According to the human rights organization HRANA, as of Friday, 528 protesters had been killed, including 71 minors.
The report also said that 70 government security personnel were killed.
It is believed that up to 19,763 protesters were arrested.
For weeks, Iranian leaders and state media have been calling for people to vote at rallies on Saturday to show their opposition to protests and support for the government.
On the night of Friday, the anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, official media showed fireworks as part of the government-sponsored celebration, and people shouted "Allahu Akbar!"
(God is the greatest!)
However, many people at the rally could be heard shouting, "Dictator, die!"
"
On Saturday, the government television station broadcast live footage of official gatherings in all the states of the country.
In Tehran, as part of the official celebrations, domestically produced anti-ballistic missiles, drones, anti-submarine frigates and other military equipment were displayed.
President Leslie's speech was often interrupted by the slogan "America, go to hell" - a signature slogan at state rallies.
The crowd also chanted "Death to Israel".
Reuters said that Adelkhah, who has been in prison since 2019, is one of seven French nationals detained in Iran, which is a factor in the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran in recent months.
She was sentenced to five years in prison in 2020 for national security crimes.
They later placed her under house arrest, but in January she returned to prison.
Adelkhah denied these allegations.
A week before Meszaros was released, supporters warned that he was at risk of death due to his hunger strike.
He was arrested in 2018 for protesting against the compulsory wearing of headscarves.
The French Foreign Ministry responded to Adelkhah's release on Friday, calling for her freedom to be restored, "including if she wishes, she should be allowed to return to France."

Did the balloon incident shine a light on America?
Strengthen restrictions on technology exports to China
According to a report by the Wall Street Journal today, the United States is preparing to further tighten its technology exports to China after the balloon incident.
Current and former security officials say the balloon incident highlights the national security threat posed by China and will generate more political support for strengthening U.S. technological protection.
The United States claims that the balloon carries antennas and sensors for intelligence gathering and communication.
According to Martijn Rasser, a former senior official of the US Central Intelligence Agency and currently serving at the New American Security Center in Washington.
"This is undoubtedly pouring oil on the fire, supporting the hard-line view on China."
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday, "We will also consider taking broader action to expose and respond to China's larger-scale surveillance activities, which pose a threat to our national security and that of our allies and partners."
"US officials said they have informed the governments of more than 30 countries about the balloon incident, and international coordination is crucial to counter the threat from China.
Emily Benso, a senior researcher at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that in addition to the actions of the Biden administration, the newly established Special Committee on the Strategic Competition between the United States and the Communist Party of China in the US House of Representatives may also pressure the United States to take more severe measures to slow down China's development.
She said that members of Congress will feel increasing pressure to take a tougher stance, which could force the White House to adopt a tougher policy.
The Wall Street Journal reported that many people who advocate for stricter export controls are also pushing to expand the scope of controls to include industries such as artificial intelligence.
The US government has also been developing a foreign investment review plan to examine whether US investments overseas pose potential national security threats from China.
Analysts say the White House may face calls to move more quickly to implement the plan.
The earthquake relief work in Syria continues day and night
Since the strong earthquake hit Turkey and neighboring Syria, rescue teams from dozens of countries have been working tirelessly day and night in the ruins of thousands of buildings that were destroyed by the earthquake, rescuing survivors buried under rubble.
In the cold, they often call for silence, as they struggle to hear any sign of life from the crumbling concrete piles.
According to a report by Reuters today, two more women were rescued from the rubble of the earthquake after surviving for several days.
However, the number of deaths caused by the earthquake has risen to 24,150.
The death toll in Turkey was 20,665, and the death toll in Syria exceeded 3,500.
The 7.8 magnitude earthquake that occurred on Monday continued to cause strong aftershocks in Turkey and Syria, making it the seventh deadliest natural disaster of the century, surpassing the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan and coming close to the 31,000 deaths caused by the 2003 earthquake in neighboring Iran.
A similar strong earthquake that occurred in the northwest of Turkey in 1999 caused the deaths of more than 17,000 people.
Turkish authorities said on Saturday that two women were trapped for 122 hours after the deadliest earthquake to hit the region in 20 years, and were rescued by rescue workers from the rubble of collapsed buildings in Turkey.
Another injured man, 55-year-old Masallah Cicek, was rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building in Diyarbakir, the largest city in southeast Turkey.
In the frigid temperatures, rescuers often call for quiet, as they struggle to hear any signs of life from the crumbling pile of concrete.
In the Samandag district of Turkey, rescuers crouched under the concrete slabs, whispering "Inshallah" - "God willing" - as they carefully reached into the rubble to rescue a newborn baby who was only 10 days old.
He opened his eyes wide, and the baby Yagiz Ulas was wrapped in a warm blanket and taken to a field hospital.
The video images show that the emergency personnel also took away his mother, who was dizzy and pale-faced on the stretcher, but conscious.
Fuat Oktay, the Vice President of Turkey, told reporters overnight that 67 people were rescued from the rubble in the past 24 hours, and 31,000 rescue personnel were mobilized in the affected areas.
He said that about 80,000 people were receiving treatment in hospitals, while 1.05 million people were homeless due to the earthquake and were crammed into temporary shelters.
As many people lack food in the cold winter conditions, the public's doubts about the disaster relief response of the leaders of the two countries are increasing.
According to Syrian official media, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his wife Asma visited a hospital in Aleppo. This is reportedly the first time he has visited the affected area since the earthquake.
Earlier, the World Food Programme said that due to the complicated rescue work caused by the war, its stocks in the northwest of Syria, which is controlled by rebels, are about to run out.
On Friday, Erdogan visited Adiyaman province in Turkey, where he admitted that the government's response was not as fast as expected.
Opponents have seized on this issue to attack Erdoğan, who is running for re-election in a vote on May 14, but it may be postponed due to the disaster.
Reuters said that anger over delayed aid and the start of rescue efforts could affect the election.
Even before the earthquake, the vote was seen as the most severe challenge to Erdoğan's two decades in power.
Erdogan called for unity and condemned what he called "negative campaigns for political interests."
The leader of Turkey's main opposition party, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, criticized the government's response.
Critics say, "The earthquake was big, but what is more serious than the earthquake is the lack of coordination, lack of planning, and incompetence.

VietNamNet Hanoi - During his visit to Brunei Darussalam, on the morning of February 11, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and his wife visited the University of Brunei Darussalam (UBD, abbreviated as "Brunei University").
The University of Brunei Darussalam is the largest higher education and scientific research center in Brunei, and is ranked third in the local university rankings.
The University of Brunei Darussalam is one of the symbols of Vietnam-Brunei cooperation in education and training.
In July 2013, the University of Brunei Darussalam officially established a cooperative relationship with Vietnam's FPT University, mainly in the field of English language training.
In addition to English, French, German, Japanese, and Korean, Vietnamese is also included in the curriculum of the University of Brunei Darussalam.
During his visit to the University of Brunei, the Prime Minister of Vietnam, Pham Minh Chinh, and his wife exchanged with students in the Vietnamese language class.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh is happy that more and more foreigners are learning Vietnamese, and he is making an active contribution to promoting the unique cultural characteristics and local customs of Vietnam to the world.
The Prime Minister of the Government, Pham Minh Chinh, expressed his belief and hope that the Vietnamese language teacher team at Brunei University will become stronger and stronger; the students in the Vietnamese language class are increasingly interested in Vietnamese, striving to learn it, and can soon use fluent Vietnamese, and become ambassadors of the friendly and cooperative relations between Vietnam and Brunei.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh also took the opportunity to communicate with Vietnamese students studying English at the FPT-UBD Global Center in Tien Giang City via video, to understand their learning situation, especially during the epidemic.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh believes that the cooperation between Vietnam's FPT University and Brunei University, especially the FPT-UBD Global Center, is a vivid symbol of the cooperation between Vietnam and Brunei in education.
At the same time, I hope that the students of the center will make greater progress in their studies and make positive contributions to the friendly cooperative relations between Vietnam and the two countries.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh highly praised the achievements of the two countries in education cooperation during his discussions with the Minister of Education of Brunei and the leaders of Brunei University. These achievements include the cooperation between FPT University and Brunei University, as well as the initiative of Brunei University to include Vietnamese language in the curriculum.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh hopes that the University of Brunei Darussalam will continue to pay attention to ensuring the quality of Vietnamese language teaching and further expand the scale of Vietnamese language classes.
Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh also highly evaluated the positive results achieved by the two countries in cooperation based on the Memorandum of Understanding on Educational Cooperation signed in April 2014; he suggested that Brunei continue to provide more scholarships and effectively carry out various short-term exchange training programs, such as the Global Discovery Programme and the Discovery Year.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng highly praised the establishment of the first branch of the University of Brunei Darussalam in Vietnam; believes that the university's development scale in the region and the world is increasingly strong; and further expand cooperation with Vietnamese higher education institutions.
On this occasion, Prime Minister Fan Ming and his wife planted a commemorative tree in the campus of the University of Brunei and left a message in the commemorative book.
Prime Minister Fan Mingjie wishes that the University of Brunei Darussalam will continue to develop and contribute more and more to Brunei's education industry, and deepen and broaden cooperation with Vietnam's educational and training institutions.

What exactly was the "object" that was shot down over Alaska?
Confused and full of guesses
The US military used the most advanced stealth fighter jet F-22 to shoot down an unidentified object flying in the airspace of Alaska, USA, on the afternoon of Friday (February 10).
The location where the plane was shot down is ten miles from the coast of Alaska.
This is the second time the US military has shot down an airborne object in less than a week.
Last Saturday, a spy balloon from China drifted over the United States for several days before being destroyed by the US military near the coast of South Carolina.
The Pentagon said that the second object shot down entered US airspace for the first time on Thursday night, was tracked by the US military while moving over northeastern Alaska, and was flying at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet), about the size of a small car. It was much smaller than the previous Chinese spy balloon that was shot down.
The Pentagon also believes that there is currently no evidence to suggest that the object is maneuverable.
John Coyne, the strategic communications coordinator for the National Security Council at the White House, said on Friday that while the specific nature of the object flying at high altitude was not clear, it "posed a reasonable threat to the safety of civilian aircraft."
Kobe said that this object was different from the spy balloon found in the United States, as it did not have a "payload" hanging from it.
Kobe said, "We call it a 'body' because it's the best description we can make of it at the moment."
President Biden listened to the advice of the Pentagon before ordering the object to be shot down, and he made the decision "very carefully," Cobie added.
The official description of this object in the United States can be roughly summarized as follows: it is about the size of a small car, has no control stick, no suspension device, and flies at an altitude of about 10,000 meters.
But this information still cannot answer basic questions, such as what the object is, which country it belongs to, and what tasks it is carrying out.
Currently, many analyses and guesses on the Internet suggest that it may be another Chinese balloon.
It may be from China, just like the spy balloon that invaded US airspace and the Chinese balloon that floated over Latin America, which were carrying out some kind of mission in different locations.
Some people have linked this "object" in Alaska with "unidentified flying objects" (UFOs).
The report by the American Newsweek quoted a tweet posted by former US Congressman Peter Meijer on Friday, saying, "I really hope that this 'unidentified flying object' is a spy balloon, not a legitimate UFO."
"It is surprising that the comparison of alien spacecraft with weather balloons is being made, but this should not lead to an interstellar conflict," said Mejj.
Magee tweeted this shortly after Kobe confirmed that the object in Alaska had been shot down.
Newsweek said that it was not just Mejia who suspected that the object was a UFO.
Tennessee Republican Congressman Tim Burchett criticized the government's cover-up of intelligence last month, calling on the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to release a report on "unidentified flying objects."
Amazon's customer service attitude is hard to believe
I estimate that very few people have seen this place, but I still want to say a few words.
This shirt was originally a lace-up shirt when we bought it, but it was eventually sent to me as a short-sleeved shirt.
After receiving the clothes, I immediately contacted Amazon customer service, and at that time, it was confirmed that the clothes were still in stock. I asked for a replacement, and the customer service said they would solve it, and then I immediately saw that the product name changed to short sleeves, and the link I bought was taken down.
Then, the customer service will notify you to either keep the goods and compensate you with a certain amount, or to return the goods.
Is this how Amazon handles things?
It's really hard to believe that the wrong clothes were sent to me, which is not my problem. As a consumer, I want to get the goods I should get, and I didn't make any exaggerated demands. Amazon changed the name and said there was no stock.
This is my first long review, and I hope it's not my last.
Sleeves that are incomprehensible to people
It is said to be made of leather, and it is indeed quite hard, but if you look closely, there are many small cracks on it, and it is not clear whether it is real leather. Moreover, the sleeves of this coat are really incomprehensible. The sleeves of a jacket are usually longer than the sleeves of a dress, but usually only by 1-2 cm. This coat is 5 cm longer, and the arms should naturally hang down to the position of the palm of the hand, but the sleeves of this coat cover the fingers.
Buying clothes is easy, but returning them is easy too.
But when will the money be returned?
The clothes are well made, but because the size is too small, I had to return them, but after returning the clothes, it has been more than a week, and I still haven't received a refund?
Moreover, the buyer had to contact the unreliable Fengfeng Express, which was the worst shopping experience since buying items from Amazon!
But the store is still good, actively cooperating to prompt the courier to refund in a timely manner, but the work of this Full Peak Courier is really making people angry, it takes about half a month to refund, this kind of partner is dragging Amazon's leg, the work efficiency is poor, and there is no service awareness!
More suitable for young people
It's a 99-second kill.
The workmanship, color, and feel of the underwear are all good, soft/thin, and not oily.
Unfortunately, the model is slim, which is more suitable for young people.
3XL, flat waist circumference 2 feet 5 inches, maximum stretch size 4 feet, 1.79/80 kilograms, the waist is a bit tight.
It seems that there is no belt to loosen or tighten around my waist, and it is quite difficult to loosen my waistband.
In addition, wearing a tight-fitting garment is uncomfortable.
It's good, but not very bright
It just went up by over 200, what's going on?
The first time Amazon used the delivery company TNT, the delivery person did not deliver the package to my home. Later, I arranged two times for the delivery person to deliver the package, but the delivery person did not deliver it. Later, I directly returned the package, and this delivery person had no integrity at all. I strongly recommend not to use TNT again.
This time, a sweater that I bought was also returned to me, and the price went up by more than 100 yuan.
Amazon should not sell these products
Buy it when it's on sale, it's not cheap, and the reviews are also very good.
When I received the product, I was stunned. The surface of the product was heavily worn, and there was wear in many other places. It was either a substandard product or a used product.
I applied for a return, and the factory people said it was caused by transportation after seeing the picture, isn't that nonsense?
How could the goods wear out inside?
There are only two possibilities: either it is a substandard or a damaged product, or I deliberately damaged the product and then returned it.
Objectively speaking, I have no evidence to prove that I have not damaged the goods, but based on my credit record when shopping on Amazon, I believe that such goods should not appear in Amazon's self-owned products. When customers choose Amazon's self-owned products, it is because they trust them. Customer win, we win. The customer's victory is the victory of the manufacturer. I hope everyone can work together to improve, thank you.
I have been using this product for less than a year, and two E2s have appeared. I don't know how to deal with it?
I purchased this product on July 30, 2015, but the right two groups of the receiver often showed red E2 in March 2016. It should be a problem with the transmitter module, right? This doesn't seem to match the statement on the Amazon website that the transmitter module can work for 7 years. I can't find any after-sales service on the Amazon website. How should I do?
It's okay
The first purchase was bad.
It doesn't feel new.
The labels on the box were torn off, and the labels on the body of the machine were broken.
And it always goes blank.
It's better now.
The exchange is quite fast, a bit blurry at night, the view is not very wide, but it is enough for ordinary home use.
The only downside is that I don't have a card, I bought it myself, and I also bought a phone from Amazon before.
There will be a sticker on the packaging to prevent the packaging from being opened, but there was none this time. When I bought the phone, there was a sticker that looked like this one, which I could stick on the warranty card, but there was none this time.
I'm confused because I don't know if it's because the price has gone down or not.
Waiting for the supplier to respond
The packaging had no markings, so I called the supplier directly and said that the answer was that it was a genuine product. If you have any doubts, you can send the packaging to Johnson & Johnson for inspection. They also left their license plate number and phone number, and promised to send a text message to enter my information into the Johnson & Johnson warranty card. Why haven't I received a text message yet?
I received the oil in the morning and changed it in the afternoon.
Second purchase.
Amazon's self-produced products are also very reassuring.
The master who changed the oil said the oil was clear and it was indeed good oil.
Because it was the second time I bought it.
So I'm still very confident.
The delivery was fast, the packaging was not picky, and the engine noise was significantly reduced after using this oil.
The price-performance ratio is good, and it is difficult to find synthetic engine oil below 200.
Support Star Crown, support winning, effectively protect the car.
Japanese Amazon caused serious harm to the interests of buyers due to customer service problems（8c's moths shipped as 8cm's moths）（8c=14cm，8cm=2c）
Admitting mistakes, but always shirking responsibility, always emphasizing that the goods are third-party goods, and cannot be bound by third parties.
Order number: 503-4265464-1830254.
I initially purchased the page size options of 7c, 8, and 9c. At that time, I thought this was a trap. I called the Japanese customer service and clearly informed them that 8 was 8c. However, when the goods returned to China, I found that it was only 8cm. I feel that this was a trap deliberately set up to cheat Chinese people (according to Amazon's after-sales service). Now, the page no longer has this option.
Chinese customer service: I'm sorry for causing you loss, we have two options for you:
1. If you return the item, the buyer will bear all the shipping costs.
2. If you do not return the item, we will compensate you with 1,000 yen.
(I'll do the math, the shoes are over 4000 yen, which is equivalent to 200rmb, option 1, I don't have shoes, I've lost 200 yen.
Option 2, I have shoes, and finally compensated me 2000 yen, and finally lost 150rmb. Customer service: We have recorded it, we will handle it seriously, and the next day, we returned the letter, saying that I do not accept the mediation of the Chinese customer service, and that's it.
I asked: When I bought a page with confusing options such as 7c, 8c, and 9c, the Chinese customer service helped me understand that Japanese common codes do not have c, such as 140, but have you checked other mosquito pages?
There are some cases where there are mixed codes for Japanese and English.
Furthermore, why did you put the 8cm in between the 7c and 9c, which is the smallest size, and what does it mean to put it there.
Chinese customer service: We provide Chinese services, but we do not know if you want to return to your country, so we will not compensate for your shipping costs.
I don't understand this logic, I am Japanese, I need Chinese customer service, Chinese living in Japan don't need Chinese customer service, tourists in Japan don't need Chinese customer service, so the question is, who needs to call Amazon overseas purchase Chinese customer service, it's just like me, a Japanese buyer.
Isn't the Amazon Chinese customer service just convenient for those of us who do cross-border shopping?
I am not very satisfied with this purchase
This is the second time I have purchased baby diapers from Amazon. I bought a box of them when my baby was 2 months old. I chose diapers made of European imported paper. I was quite satisfied with my first purchase experience. My baby used one diaper all night, and it was indeed possible to go 12 hours without changing a diaper.
But this time, when I bought L-type diapers, there were two packages in one box, and when I opened them, I found that the paper was quite soft, and there was a noticeable difference between them and the imported Pampers. After using them, they were still okay, and there were no signs of leaks or rashes.
But when we got to the second diaper, the baby's inner thigh immediately developed a rash, which has not gone away to this day.
I doubt the quality of the two bags in the first box.
I won't buy it again in the future!
Hope for the protection of the transportation of parcels
This is the worst packaging and transportation I have seen in all my online shopping. There are no protective measures at all, no buffer foam, no buffer layer material, nothing.
It's just a deformed box.
Moreover, the soft plastic boxes inside were all crushed and deformed.
I hope it is genuine and of good quality, so I won't dare to buy things from the Amazon in the future.
I would rather be half as rich but have a safety net.
Moreover, the issue of product packaging has been commented on in 2016, and it is still the same as it was 19 years ago.
This shows that Amazon does not care about service feedback at all, and is far behind domestic companies such as JD.com and Tmall.
It's beautiful, but a bit disappointing
I really like the color of the whole cup, which is orange-red, although my family is a boy's family, but I still think that orange-red and yellow are a bright combination.
It's smaller than I imagined, but it was meant to be taken out of the house, so it's still acceptable.
I tried it at home last night, and the distance between the straw and the cap is too close after the cap is pushed open. Because the straw is in a vertical position, my son always has to hold the bump on the cap to drink water. I wonder if this place can be improved.
It seems that the straw cups of other brands are tilted because they are made for children, who really care about safety and comfort.
Lightweight and large capacity
I like it because it is lightweight, has a large opening, and I feel like the two separate compartments are a bit excessive for me, and I don't know what to put in them.
After buying, I found that there was another brand that was very similar to Meiyao in the overseas market, and it was only about 200 yuan.
Fake goods are particularly bad
Amazon sells fake goods, and I have been fooled.
The customer service said that because it was used, it cannot be returned, so I don't know if it is fake.
Because of trust, I am sad, after all, it is a makeup product, so go to a physical store and buy it, it is a little more expensive.
Because it is a flash sale, I didn't read the comments, and I have already submitted the e-commerce platform to the State Administration for Industry and Commerce.
Is it broken?
Fake goods?
In short, a tragedy.
The second one was chosen because it had fine pores, but when I opened it, it smelled strange, so I thought it was normal because I had never used it before. When I put it on my face, I couldn't stand it anymore. It had a very strong smell that I couldn't describe, and I coughed immediately. My eyes also hurt, and I cried. I immediately took it off and washed my face.
I found another one that is the same, but not as strong, and I am applying it now.
It reminded me of the smell of cheap hair dye in a salon.
I can't imagine that Amazon's own skincare products will be affected by this.
You are a traitor.
When I purchased it, the activity page said that if you spend 99 yuan, you will receive a set of "Three-Body Problem" books. When I received the goods, there was no such gift. I called customer service and asked them to show me the screenshot of the activity at that time. The problem is that whoever buys things also saves the webpage screenshot. You yourself have done the activity, and you still need the customer to provide you with it. Buyers, please save the evidence next time.
Feelings afterward
This is the first time I have bought something on Amazon. I have a few feelings about it. First, it is indeed painless, and there is no stimulating taste. Overall, it is quite good. It fell off after about 8 minutes of waiting. There were a few sweat flakes on it, but they were not noticeable unless you looked closely. Overall, it is quite good.
Anyway, I think this thing is really good.
The second one was ordered on the 27th, received on the 12th, and it took a total of 15 days, or half a month. The delivery service of Amazon is also very good.
Third, don't believe in Amazon's Black Friday. Order on Friday, and it will be cheaper by nearly 12 yuan after two days. I bought it for more than 170 yuan (including shipping and so on), and it feels like they raise the price when they have an activity.
The customer service said that the price fluctuates, and the price has been like this for more than 10 days, with not much fluctuation.
Affordable price, made in Japan, with Chinese labels, with granules, definitely buy back!
The ones with grains in the paste are refreshing and leave a smooth feeling on the teeth. There are too many second-hand things there, which they say are imported. However, many things don't have Chinese labels, so I don't know where they are sourced from.
From now on, I will never buy second-hand goods again as long as Amazon has them.
I have a suggestion. Sometimes, the order cannot be posted on the Amazon app. I hope the app can be improved and get better and better!
Over the years, the quality of service has been getting worse and worse, and there is no quality of service to speak of!
The garbage is excellent and does not care about customer needs. When placing an order, the special delivery time is from 19:00 to 22:00.
Because there are elderly people at home who are bedridden after surgery, it is only convenient to receive parcels at night.
The result was that they came directly to my doorstep at noon, without even calling me first.
If the delivery time is up to your courier, why bother to make up a time for the customer to choose?
If your logistics cannot guarantee service, then you should just not do e-commerce!
A senior citizen with three wounds on his body has to get out of bed to open the door to receive a package, and he has to pay for it with change!
The contact number is on the order!
No one has called to explain it from the beginning to the end!
The so-called complaint customer service of Zhuozhe Network is a group of outsiders pretending to be there, fobbing off your complaints and then giving you a so-called response.
There will be no changes or compensation!
I had to put up with this kind of thing before, but I couldn't put up with it this time, it was too much!
The new book I bought was pre-sold and when it arrived, the cover and the back were the opposite, so I just closed my eyes and sent the book to the customer?
Even if you leave a negative comment, no one will contact you.
Over the years, the quality of service has been getting worse and worse, and there is no quality of service to speak of!
I will not spend a penny on Excellence again.
The picture quality is simply unacceptable
As a title such as “Ancient Map Collection”, the book is really hard to accept in terms of the selection of pictures, layout, and printing, and some pictures even have mosaics, blurred to the point of being unrecognizable.
Even if this book is not a professional map book, even if it is a small illustration, it should be able to live up to the ancient and precious cultural heritage left by our ancestors in the catalogue!
(And many of the images can be obtained from relevant industry resources in clear original files.) What is the difference between using such images to compile books and not using images?
I regret this kind of learning spirit.
No comment on the writing, each family has its own preferences.
Overall 2 stars.
When I was in high school, I read this book just to kill time, thinking that I wouldn't get addicted to it because I wasn't really interested in web novels in the past.
Then... he fell into the hole.
According to the plot, the whole book is quite light and pleasant. When Ye Shu was still in the game, even if there were conflicts between guilds, they were not very serious because they were often caused by Ye Shen Dog Blood.
As for the part about the competition, it conveys a bittersweet feeling of the changes and transitions of the times（perhaps it is because I am too sentimental）.
Reading the whole book took up a lot of my time in high school, but I just couldn't stop.
The full-time depiction of characters and emotional lines is very impressive, and some characters only appear occasionally, but they still leave a deep impression on people. For example, the characters Ye Shuang, Huang Shuangtian, and Su Mochi have a large number of fans, while the characters who are not in the writing center, such as Jiang Bo, Chu Yunxiu, etc., are also very popular. In a light novel about e-sports, it is hard to find a character that people hate the most. This is the success of full-time in character depiction.
In terms of the romance line, there is no problem with the concubines in the palace, which is the bane of most web novels, where there are either beautiful women or rotten ones. All the characters in the novel have one thing in common: they like the game Honor and want a fair victory.
The sub-plot is not very grand, but everyone seems so simple and adorable.
This may also be why there are no unlikable characters in full-time work.
The full-time IP is very large, and it is also due to this.
Leaving aside the phenomenon of web literature, this book is a good read.
He really does provide some blood and sweat, and a little bit of inspiration.
This April, I will be fully immersed in anime.
I have wanted to buy this set of books for a long time, but I was reluctant to spend too much money, and then when I wanted to buy them, I found that there were a lot of counterfeits on the TB, and there was a new version recently. I really like the cover, but I still want to buy the old version first, so I looked on Amazon and bought a set at once.
Next, let me briefly talk about the goods.
● The fourth book has no plastic wrap, but the book is new.
● The seventeenth book is sealed but has been opened, and the quality of the book feels strange and hard to the touch.
● The 23rd and 17th books are the same, but they are harder than the 17th book, but they are very old.
● The publishers of some books seem to be different, such as the 23rd and 17th, which seem to be the same publisher, and the others are different.
Overall, it is satisfactory, a big box of 24, which is very satisfying.
The Little Lion of Loneliness
When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as Lost in Translation, but there's a lot of text!
I read it three times before I could finish reading this book to the little ones. It's about a little lion who can shoot a gun and loves to eat juice and candy.
When I saw the scene where the lion ate the hunter, I felt a little uncomfortable, and modern city people can't accept such an arrangement where they are eaten by animals.
In the end, this little lion, which has succeeded in human society, has lost itself. It is no longer a complete lion, nor is it a complete human.
Finally, only the back of the little lion is visible, and it is not known where he has gone.
Years later, the image of the little lion may still remain in the memory of the grown-up children, and be recalled by chance one day, perhaps touching or inspiring them.
A collection of works with high cost-effectiveness
1. I didn't know about TASCHEN before, but I recently bought a lot of their books because they are so powerful, both in terms of their choice of topics and their production.
This work has been released in three versions, the largest of which is almost as big as the Michelangelo Buonarroti Complete Works, measuring 50 cm long and 34 cm wide; the middle version is about 36 cm long and 23 cm wide; and this version is the smallest, and comes with two books in a book box.
I personally think it is acceptable. Firstly, it is cheap and the 700-page book is divided into two volumes, which is convenient to read; secondly, it is different from the complete works of Michelangelo, where the paintings are the main part, and the black and white manuscripts of Da Vinci occupy most of it. For readers with limited budget and non-art majors, this version is the best in terms of cost-effectiveness for appreciating paintings and manuscripts.
2. The explanations for the painting section are great, with composition analysis, draft analysis, and historical context (such as the last supper), but I'm not sure if it's a printing or book size issue, some of the shadow parts are too deep, making it hard to see the details, which is a bit regrettable.
3. Compared to Michelangelo's manuscripts, the content of Da Vinci's manuscripts is much richer.
The former is already a genius, and the latter is so broad in its pursuits and so high in its achievements that it is not enough to describe it as a genius.
If you only saw Da Vinci's paintings before, you could only experience half of it. After seeing the manuscript, you are completely speechless.
Garbage, whoever buys it regrets it!
I never give a bad review, this is really trash, I wasted money buying it, damn it, give me a reason!
1. When you walk, you can't go back, and suddenly it becomes January 1, and time is reset.
2. The poor quality straps are not made of silicone, and they cause allergic reactions and bumps on the wrist.
3. Often can't connect to the phone.
4. The battery life is only five days.
5. Sleep detection is not displayed, and the time is 0.
6. Not waterproof.
7. Other.
Logistics is too slow
The result was received on the 21st, after the 16th, and it was a bad review!
The delivery is too slow, and it's already slow to buy things on Amazon, but I didn't expect it to be this slow!
Overall satisfied
I was worried about the camera's packaging at first, but this time it was fine, there was an inflatable bag inside, the camera was consistent with the three codes, and I could register on the official website, the shutter speed was 0, and the rest could only wait for time to test it.
The delivery speed is pretty fast, and I want to complain about the delivery guy here. Valuable items are placed in the porch, and he is very fast. I can't open the package in front of him to check it, which is really incomprehensible.
The seller has thought of the customer before shipping the goods:)
The seller is very responsible, and he specifically called to ask about the screen size of the camera used, which really shows that he cares about the customer.
The delivery speed is also fast.
It is also quite suitable and useful to apply diamond film.
Battery not fully charged
The machine is indeed good, I want to ask how come it can't be fully charged the first time I charge it, and the charging indicator light is always red
Currently, there is no official feedback channel for Amazon, so you can only leave feedback in the product reviews
On March 29, the book was purchased for 31 yuan through pre-order, indicating that it will be pushed to the device on March 31. At this time, the book cannot be previewed on the Amazon official website (because it has not yet been published);
2. On March 31, the book was pushed to the device, and the content was blank, with only a request to wait, while the electronic version of the book on Amazon was reduced to 18 yuan;
3. I have been trying to delete the blank book downloaded on the device and synchronize it again for two days, but I still cannot get the electronic version of "The Essence of Business" containing the actual content, but I can preview the book on the Amazon official website.
I have a few thoughts at the moment
1. The issue of price is not the most important one. The key is how to replace the blank books on Kindle with books with actual content, rather than always downloading “please wait”
2. The books that were pre-ordered will not be purchased again in the future, because if you skip the line, it will be very complicated to download a book with empty content;
3. I hope Amazon provides a normal channel for feedback on such issues, so that when there are doubts about downloading or using e-books, there is a place to report them (work orders or online customer service are both acceptable, and you can refer to how Microsoft's official store does it).
Not recommended for reading
I read it a long time ago, and I just happened to see that you wrote a comment on it.
This book is not a collection of short stories, but rather a collection of fragments of life about love.
The tone of the book is extremely plain, like plain water, and the choice of words and phrases is the epitome of simplicity, and the plot is as calm and plain as a summer afternoon street.
Every short story is a fragment of time from ordinary life, without a beginning or an end.
Finally, they were collected together and named "What are we talking about when we talk about love?"
I think this collection of short stories, and its title, is like a form of performance art. The author wants to express that love is not just the ups and downs of love on stage, but also the urban legends of love and hate. Love is not just a love affair, but also a life that is as plain as water. It is a life that is monotonous and tasteless, a life without any effort, an escape from reality, and a sense of uncertainty about the future.
When you read this book, you may recall the quarrels of the couple next to you, the tasteless marriages of people you know, and the unpleasant relationships.
This is precisely why I do not recommend reading it. From an aesthetic point of view, the writing and plot of the book are tasteless, unless you live a life of turbulence and sweetness, or you live in a candy castle. Otherwise, you will feel that it is strange but not strange and boring.
In terms of depth of thought, the everyday plot does not make one's eyes light up or expand one's thoughts and vision (this is different from Marquez's Love in the Time of Cholera), and the brief segments do not explore any issues, such as what kind of mistakes led to the failure of love?
What are the reasons for the breakdown of the protagonist's marriage?
So I don't recommend reading this book, whether you read it or not doesn't really matter.
The author's ideas are expressed more through techniques and forms than through the plot of the story, which is also the reason for the poor reading experience of this book.
It is suitable for casual reading and cannot be read in detail.
The logic of the book is good, but the content is not rich enough.
It explained what sales theory is and why, but it was weak in terms of how to do it, just pointing out the direction but not giving specific practices.
In addition, the book feels like it was put together.
The examples include both domestic and foreign ones; both well-known entrepreneurs or salespeople and people who are not well-known.
I don't know if it's a story compiled for the sake of example, but if some cases experienced by the authors are given, it will be more convincing.
The terms "customer" and "client" are used interchangeably.
The title is still the customer, but in the main text it becomes the customer.
There were also problems with typos, missing punctuation marks, and incorrect numbering in the e-book.
In short, this book is a good choice for those who want to start learning theory, but it is not suitable for those who are already engaged in sales and want to improve their sales level.
A quick introduction to the Internet Finance Reading List
This book is very shallow, it can be said that it is just an introduction, it can help you quickly understand the overall picture of Internet finance, but if you want to understand it in depth, you still need to dig deeper on your own.
It was published earlier, and the later WeChat and Alipay subsidy war to cultivate user habits has not been mentioned. Nowadays, the share of third-party payment may not be as small as it was in the book.
Nowadays, many people go out to eat and just bring their mobile phones with them. Merchants have also abandoned UnionPay because of the high bank transaction volume.
However, I am very grateful to the author for writing this introduction book. It can be seen that the author has at least several years of financial observation experience, and is very familiar with the financial development history of both China and abroad.
It's easy to write something high and grand, but the difficult part is to write something that is easy to understand.
I appreciate you, and I want you to know it!
The first factor that determines a person's job satisfaction is not the salary, but whether they are given enough attention and appreciation in their work.
According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, after the basic survival needs of a person are met, the most urgent need is the psychological need for understanding, recognition, and appreciation.
Indeed, for the Chinese people, most of them are “love you in their hearts but can’t say it”, even if they have love, gratitude and appreciation, they will keep it to themselves and not say it out loud.
The author discusses five languages of appreciation in the book: affirming words, thoughtful gestures, acts of service, heartfelt gifts, and physical touch.
I think what's important is not what the five languages of appreciation are, but whether you can use these five languages to express your appreciation and gratitude to the people around you at any time and place, whether it's your family, friends or colleagues.
In fact, the closer the relationship, the more we need to appreciate and be grateful, so that our lives can become more beautiful.
Learning to appreciate can to some extent retain talents and reduce the turnover rate of enterprises.
Thank you to the translator for bringing us the wonderful thoughts and world of foreign countries.
Due to differences in cultural backgrounds between the East and the West, there will be some differences between languages, and if you have the opportunity to see the original version, you will gain more.
Thank you again to the author, translator, and editors for their hard work!
Suspected counterfeit products, please Amazon strictly review
The quality is terrible, the packaging is flimsy, it has no weight, and it is even worse than the products sold by street vendors. It has no weight, no barcode, and the ten-packaging is also flimsy, which is not the characteristic of a qualified product; it is the worst shopping experience on Amazon, and I have applied for a return; it is completely a quality problem; I suggest that the merchant wipe his eyes and refuse inferior goods; supplement: I bought another pack of heart-shaped stamps, 23 yuan/10 stamps at the supermarket, and added some comparison photos, which further confirmed the inferiority of this product. In order to provide consumers with a clearer reference, avoid economic losses and further discomfort, I hope the merchant can wipe his eyes and refuse inferior goods!
Once again, we hope that Amazon can be meticulous and strict in controlling the source of its products.
The products of Mama Turtle are not up to expectations
Advantages:
1. Big brands, cheap prices.
Advantage 2: The motor and blade are both guaranteed by PANASONIC, and they are OK to use, but they are not as good as I expected.
Disadvantages:
1. The charging cable does not have a charging indicator light, which means you do not have to pay for the most basic power indicator. Customers who buy products for 300 yuan are probably considered a waste and have no respect in the eyes of Panasonic.
2. Strong odor. Even if you only charge it for 10 minutes, you can smell the strong odor of burning plastic.
The office tried it for a day, and the whole house smelled like plastic.
Compared to the Philips PHILIPS I used before, although it has more blades, the quality of this Sharp product is really not up to the consumer's expectations.
Small packaging
When I received the express delivery, I saw that it was the e-commerce version. I knew I had been scammed again. It was smaller than the one I bought at the supermarket. It should be M. The packaging was different from the one on the product introduction. It was the new version, I guess.
The three stars are blaming themselves for not paying attention to the specifications of the goods, and you can sell me the M-size e-commerce version, I have no objections, but what do you mean by the version with the wrong goods?
The tricks of e-commerce are deep, so I still go to the supermarket when I have time.
It's just purple sauce.
I don't like the taste
The child doesn't like the taste of toothpaste, and every time it says it's spicy. Maybe using a different word would be more appropriate. For now, the child's vocabulary only has this word.
I bought it when I was doing an activity, so it was cheap, so I'm not going to give it a bad review, it's four stars, but I won't buy it again.
It's authentic, well packaged
The packaging is complete, with an inflatable bag inside, and there are no online reviews except for a product that looks like a bald head.
The plastic film on the outside of the bottle is the same as described in the picture, and the delivery is also very fast, arriving the next day.
It is genuine, but there is no stock, and I don't know when it will be back in stock.
A bad shopping experience
I placed an order on Black Friday, but it took a long time to receive it. When I checked, the package had been signed for a long time ago. I asked my colleagues, but they said they didn't sign for it. I immediately contacted the courier company, but they said they could only initiate an inquiry after the package was sent. I contacted Amazon customer service, and it took more than ten days to find out that the courier was mistakenly delivered to someone else. After several rounds of transfers, I finally got the courier back, but the outer package was already opened, and the goods were still intact, but I don't know if they had been used or not. Anyway, it was a pretty bad experience.
Incorrect caption
I thought I would receive a headset like picture 1, but I received a headset like picture 2. It doesn't matter that the pictures are inconsistent, but what does it mean that the left and right sides of the headset have different sound volumes?
Although the names are all the same, I hope everyone can pay attention and replace the correct picture in a timely manner.
The operating system is generally
After using it for a while, the overall picture is still good, and there is no obvious difference. However, this system is confusing to use, the boot time is obviously slow, and it is difficult to make good settings. The software that comes with it is not worth commenting on, and the response speed is even worse.
The comments say that the design is very humanized, but I couldn't find any humanized design. The location of the remote control's common up, down, left, and right buttons and the return button is really not to be praised.
So, you can be a TV, and add a TV box and so on.
The price drop is too severe
The price drop is too severe, from over 100 to 99 now!
I have a lot of unrated orders on Amazon, so I use a copy of a comment as the rating content.
If I use this sentence to evaluate it, it means that this product is at least 85 points or above.
For the poor products, I definitely won't be lazy to copy and paste the reviews, so that other consumers can use them as a reference when buying, and the merchants can improve the quality of their products as a result.
Low-priced good line, that's enough for me!
This is such a cheap line, but it should meet the HDMI certification standards. I compared it with the crap in Akihabara (the prices are twice as high), and the line is thick and soft, with no noise during transmission over 7 meters. From now on, I will trust Baisi for cheap lines!
It's okay for the East and West, but Amazon's after-sales service is really much worse than other websites
After placing the order, I found out that I made a mistake, but I can't cancel the order. The website contact online customer service always shows an error link, and I can't contact them.
After the delivery person called me, I said I didn't want it, and I tried to cancel the order, but it didn't work. The delivery person took it back, and said to sign for it first, and then I could apply for a refund.
When applying for a return, it was only then that I was informed that food items cannot be returned once they have been signed for. I couldn't call Amazon customer service, and they said the same thing: once signed for, the item cannot be returned.
I have bought items that cannot be returned due to policy at JD and Sunning, including milk and diapers, and I have contacted customer service to return them. JD's diapers smell too much when opened, but I still contacted customer service to return them. This is not the case with Amazon.
The rules are dead, people are alive, contact your customer service, how to handle it?
Tell me whether I should buy it myself or let the delivery person buy it, because it's not easy for the delivery person to buy it, why should I let the delivery person buy something that I didn't buy myself?
Okay, I won't back out either, I'll take it myself, but I must give your service a 10
I advise you not to waste money
First, I was full of anticipation when I bought it, thinking that the Dali brand should not be bad, but when I received it, I thought it was okay, the size was not bad, but there was one box that was basically all soft, you couldn't tell from the appearance, you had to touch it, when you put it in your mouth, there was no taste at all, it was bland and tasteless, when you bit into it, the flesh was dark yellow, which meant it was bad, it was a mixed bag, only about a third of it was edible, I would not recommend it, it was not cheap, the quality was too bad!
After being scammed once, I will never buy fruits from e-commerce again!
Where is the anti-counterfeiting mark on the product
The bottom of the bottle is deeply indented, which should be caused by a strong impact. From the outer packaging bag, the degree of destruction is heartbreaking. After all, the packaging of food is too simple, and it is also an international purchase. There is no obvious anti-counterfeiting mark, and it is very easy to open the bottle. The most important thing is that the honey directly comes out from the inside of the lid, which has almost no adhesive properties. Is this the case with foreign products?
I was born in China and I don't understand it.
It must be the real thing, right?
There is also a message saying that it will be delivered on the 21st, which I received on the 14th. This is my first time buying overseas here, and I just want to write down my doubts. Maybe this is all normal?
The pick-up service needs to be improved
I bought a total of 5 vouchers, and when I went to withdraw them, I made an appointment to withdraw 3 vouchers for the first time, but only 2 were sent to me. After communicating with multiple parties, it was confirmed that they were lost, and they promised to send them again.
Good shopping
The east and west are praised!
I still trust Amazon's self-produced products more, and now it's very convenient to buy from overseas. It takes a few more days to ship back from overseas than it does from within the country. I have to say that Amazon's clearance ability from overseas to China is still very strong, much faster than transshipment, so now many things are bought from overseas.
I hope the quality and price of domestic goods can be better, many things are made in China, but it is cheaper to buy them back after going out and buying them, I hope it can be improved.
Garbage
When you see a package like this, ask yourself: does it look like trash on the side of the road?
A plastic packaging that is easily broken, sent from so-called Germany in a plastic bag, is this kind of packaging responsible?
I think this kind of packaging is like garbage, and buying this product, the packaging is very simple, there is no measure to prevent damage, just a simple plastic bag packaging, after receiving it, the package is completely deformed, and the items inside are also damaged.
If I just run into one like this, I buy a few of them, and I contact Amazon customer service. The customer service says it can be returned, but the shipping fee is prepaid, and then the shipping fee is returned to me in the form of a gift card.
I asked if I paid the shipping fee with cash, you would give me a gift card, which is to say that I have to buy your gift card myself, and then I have to mail the product to your warehouse in Germany, which is to say that I have to suffer for buying a product!
I have been telling customer service that it is their responsibility to solve this problem, but they won't even admit that it is their responsibility. They are not even willing to take responsibility for half a sentence. What kind of after-sales service is this?
Quality is very good, 5 stars, but logistics is very poor
1. The quality is very good, it's a bargain, the price is reasonable, and it's worth the money.
2, the material is firm, the welding is solid, the surface treatment is appropriate, and the color is good.
3. Logistics is a hard problem, the order for number 3 came in, and the order for number 11 came in.
4. If Amazon had not marked the expected delivery time as February 7, I might have been satisfied.
5. However, if the expected delivery time is marked, it is equivalent to a commitment to the user. When the commitment cannot be fulfilled, the user is very dissatisfied.
6. If you are not sure you can keep your promise, please do not make a promise.
7，实际上，我非常在意商家做出的承诺。
8，所以，我打了低分。
The gold wire will turn black
The effect is still there, but whether it is noticeable or not depends on the individual, or on the psychological effect.
There is one thing that is not so good, which is the gold wire. It was designed to look good, but in fact, this gold wire will fade, and if you touch it a few times, you will find some gold powder on your hand and on the car.
I hope the product can be improved.
This square one also has no decorative effect, so don't bother with gold wire, it will just get dirty on the car.
The goods are complete, the speed is good, and the two packages are different packaging
The speed is quite fast in 8 days, but there are two parcels in two packages, and the packaging is different, obviously one is too much for earthquake protection, with thick cardboard and plastic layer, and the outer packaging is easy to open, like a domestic express delivery box, and a few buffer bags are enough, it seems a bit sloppy.
The Yarran mattress is really good
The 34CM mattress is not as thick as usual, and you can sleep directly on the mattress.
The quality is very good, whether it is the front or the back, it is very soft, sleeping is very comfortable, and I fell asleep very quickly when I lay on it.
After receiving the pillow, there were two stains on it due to violent transportation by express delivery. The customer service of Yarran was responsible and efficient in solving the problem.
Not self-owned products, Amazon is shameless
The page clearly indicates self-sale, but in fact it is delivered by the supplier, and after-sales service is provided by the supplier. If there is a problem, you can contact the supplier directly.
If you want to cancel the order, sorry, the order information has been transmitted to the supplier, and it cannot be canceled; if you want to return or exchange the goods, you have successfully applied for a return or exchange on Amazon, sorry, no one can help you, you need to contact the supplier to return the goods yourself.
This is a self-produced product of Nima.
The goods are not delivered by Amazon, and Amazon does not bear any responsibility for after-sales service. The customer service said, “I will contact the supplier for you”, and even claimed that it was self-owned, which is too shameless. It is a naked face and a naked fraud against consumers!
The experience of being bored
The filter cartridges I bought from other websites before were good at filtering, and even if I used them for a few more days after 28 days, there would still be no limescale.
Because the quality of the things I have purchased on Amazon has always been good, this time I wanted to buy it here. This is the first time I have bought a filter on Amazon, and I feel it is not very good. Not only did it start to have water stains early on, but the filter also had suspended black carbon powder all the way until the 28th day. I really don't know whether to continue using it or just throw it away. It's very frustrating.
Not as good as you might imagine
Compared to the plug-in boards I have used before, the external workmanship is average, and I hope that the internal workmanship is as described by the store, but from the perspective of convenience of use, whether each independent unit is electrified is lacking
The packaging is damaged, and time will tell if the product is of good quality.
The outer packaging is severely damaged, and the packaging box inside seems to be new, but the manual does not seem to be new, and it was renovated in September. It is in stock, and I hope it will not be bad when it arrives. Please explain to me why several customers have mentioned that the packaging is damaged, but you can still sell it. Thank you!
Overall, it's not bad, but there are some minor problems
When I bought a water filter for the first time, I read several reviews and felt that LAICA was a bit more cost-effective, so I chose it. When I received the goods, I installed the filter cartridge according to the instructions, tried it out, and felt that it was generally good, but when I poured water, it seemed that the original water mixed with the filtered water from the spout (the seal of the original water tank was not very tight).
When using it, make sure to wait until all the water is filtered out before pouring it out!
The picture is incomplete
The picture does not show the details of the side, and the details of the side do not match the style of the main body, with a big difference, which is one; this bead is made in Thailand, but it is not marked with the place of origin, which is two; it is not marked with the quality, which is three; when I bought it in the UK, each item had its own box, but here there is only one simple plastic bag, and there is no product mark on the bead, so how can I judge whether it is real or fake.
Be careful when buying, especially if you are buying things from Hong Kong.
Amazon customer service is terrible
The order I placed two days ago was reduced by 40 yuan today when I received it. I spent a lot of time looking for customer service, and the customer service said that they couldn't refund the difference, but I could re-order and return the item.
This customer experience and service is really different from Taobao and Tmall.
It's okay, it's worth trying for beginners
It's worth buying, and it's not comparable to the ultimate diamond. I saw the price in the mall before, it was several hundred, and I'm playing with diamond for the first time, it's okay.
It's good.
The service is really good, and I sent it to my girlfriend. However, I was a bit unhappy when I was not in Canada at noon, and the logistics company directly stored the package in the post office and did not send me a confirmation message to pick it up.
However, the baby is really good.
Worth buying
The little monkey is cute, and the Amazon discount is really big. Zhoushengsheng's official website directly ships, I placed an order last night, and I received it this afternoon, it's really fast.
The postal delivery person is also very responsible.
Congratulations!
A customer's confession
1. When you receive such defective products, Amazon customer service tells you not to worry, we will contact you within 54 hours.
2 Then contact the customer service staff in the middle, they will tell you that this problem will be handled by a specialist, and they will inform you of the result.
You can never contact this commissioner directly, you don't know her work number, you don't have a direct line, and you can't contact her, only she can contact you.
Tragically, I waited nearly three days, and the commissioner contacted me. I left my phone for a while, and I didn't receive the commissioner's call.
I waited for two hours and did not receive a call from the specialist. In the meantime, I proactively contacted Amazon customer service and emailed the customer service to ask her to call me back.
4Days have passed and I still don't know what Amazon will do with this defective coffee machine I received!
There is no problem with the products of Amazon in the United States, and shopping overseas is a good way, but the service of Meiya is far worse.
6 For me, I can only continue to wait...
The ground is uneven
Because the reviews said it was good, I was very excited about this pot, and I liked it when I got it. It was lightweight, but when I used it, I found that the bottom of the pot was not flat, but protruded in the middle and sunk around it, and the oil ran to the sides. The special fried meat I bought to cook with was not able to cover the central area, and it was a mess. I couldn't even use the pot to cook.
I don't know if it's just bad luck, but I just got a bottomless pot that's not flat, and fortunately, Amazon provides a month's return service, so I decided to return it.
I cleaned the pot thoroughly and put it away, and I was busy for half a day.
Good product design needs matching manufacturing processes to achieve
This is a product with a very simple design style.
The shape of the cube is designed with a slight arch at the top.
It should have been a very smooth line.
Unfortunately, the final result was not achieved.
Because there are two parts at the top, the front is the control panel and the back is the water tank cover.
The arc of the top cover and the arc of the control panel are not consistent, and there is a difference of up to 2 mm after assembly.
Although it looks like a very small gap.
But it can be said that it destroys the entire design.
I feel a little sorry for the product designer.
It seems that the product managers at Meitu are not yet capable of creating products of this caliber.
(Of course, we cannot expect too much from the after-sales lady, but when I heard the after-sales lady say that all the individuals of this product are like this, it is not just the one I bought that has a problem, her disbelief and sincere attitude made me realize that we cannot expect too much from beauty either)
It's a good deal after the discount, but the Amazon fake discount is heartbreaking
Buy it one week after the baby is born, it is very warm.
The outside of the pot does not feel any heat, so it can effectively protect the temperature from leaking out.
The air conditioning in the room can still maintain a high temperature after a whole night.
Amazon said there were 320 great deals for the anniversary event, but later found that everyone had 249,289,299 of them. I felt cheated for a moment, but when I went to the supermarket, I found that it was still cheaper than various brands at the same price. In the future, I can take it with me when I go out.
Vitamix 6300
I have been waiting for a long time, and I saw that Meiya 6300 was on sale, and the price of Caiyao Overseas Purchase was the same, so I quickly bought it.
I placed an order on September 2nd, and it was expected to arrive on the 21st. However, it arrived on the 12th, which was about 10 days earlier than expected. The speed is really fast!
The packaging is small, and it comes directly from the original packaging of Vitamix. Amazon doesn't mind if it gets damaged during shipping across the ocean!
The machine looks new and has all the accessories, but the cup on the base is so unstable that I'm afraid it will fly out when I turn it on!
I asked a friend who has 5200, and he described it as not as loose as mine.
The accompanying recipe is in English, which is quite tiring to read, and I couldn't find a Chinese version online, which is a nuisance!
After receiving the goods, I immediately bought a transformer, and it should arrive in three days. I will deal with it then!
It's too small, no umbrella cover, and the material is average.
It's not a big one at all!
The second Totes, 1. This one doesn't have a canopy 2. The material of the handle is generally 3. It's written as Large, but it's actually a convenient umbrella for one person, and two people using it is probably too much.
On the contrary, the one I bought from Meiya can be used by three people without any pressure.
I don't feel very well
First of all, the box is not very sturdy, it deforms when you press it, secondly, the design on the back does not prevent the ABS scratches on the box from appearing when it is flat, and thirdly, the box is just a piece of cloth wrapped around a handle, which is exposed... and so on, all kinds of dissatisfaction, and finally, the latch is a bit difficult to use.
PS: The wheels feel pretty good
It can also be
Pros: This double-shoulder bag is quite refined and looks durable.
Disadvantages: the QR code on the card cannot be scanned (what the hell is going on), the 15.6 inch laptop cannot be put in (can it be made a little longer?), the double shoulder bag has a locking mechanism, but no lock is provided for the buyer, which is not what we call service-oriented.
The overall quality is okay, but I don't know if it's genuine leather
The overall feeling is okay, but I don't know if it's real leather, so I can't give a blind evaluation.
It can hold A4-sized documents, and has held 80-page thick objects, but it is estimated that it cannot hold objects that are too thick or hard (non-deformable).
The package is soft, and the inner bag is divided in a more humanized way, which is quite good.
It's just that the bottom of the one I got has a small sand pit, I don't know if it's because my character is not good or what.
I'm too lazy to go back and forth to exchange goods, so I'll put up with it.
Overall, it's worth four stars.
ForRoyal, the world's most popular camera strap
This strap is designed to be scientific, hanging on both shoulders, practical, and the camera is fixed and protected in the front with soft materials, unlike other quick-shooters that use screws to fix the camera at the bottom, and it is also very convenient to take off the camera.
Garbage after-sales
I bought a guitar a month and a half ago, and it's missing a part. After I notified Amazon, they gave me a customer service phone number. After multiple communications, the part still hasn't arrived. What kind of efficiency is this!
After the estimate, it will be more troublesome to repair the problem, so I hope that those who are good at after-sales service can take a detour, it's too troublesome!
There are some minor flaws, but the sound is good
The head of the guitar has a defect, it lacks a corner, it feels like a substandard product, and there are no gifts, but this price is already good, and the sound of the guitar is also good.
It's okay, the first bill
It's been used for a long time, and it's generally good except for the low notes.
The workmanship is not as perfect as I imagined.
The first time I bought it, there was a problem with the product, and all the lights were flashing and couldn't be used.
I asked for a replacement, but it has been three days since the goods arrived in Shanghai and they still haven't been delivered.
I also tried calling the delivery person, but they didn't answer.
The courier company said they only had that contact information.
Amazon can't find a place to complain.
I didn't ask for it, and in the case of a delay in delivery, they arbitrarily delayed delivery according to my request - this kind of message came.
Then they talked about the issue of transit.
The poor shopping experience has made me start to doubt the effectiveness of Amazon's logistics and control systems.
I don't think I'll get it today either.
The adhesive is too weak and not waterproof
Although Bluetooth connection is convenient, the content printed on it is not waterproof, and the surface is not covered with a film; the adhesive strength of the label is poor, it is not suitable for cable labeling at all, and it is very easy to fall off, so friends who buy it to organize cables need to pay attention.
The pen is okay, but the package is too simple, just a paper box, with no protection measures, and the box that holds the pen is glued with a large piece of transparent glue, and the glue is still on the box after you tear it off.
Treating a 600 yuan item like this, it was a disappointing shopping experience.
However, the pen is not a problem.
Hope to see more improvements in the packaging in the future!
In terms of quality, if we talk about writing, 925-25 is better
First, let me praise the excellent service of TNT every day, air freight, super fast, and the service attitude is also very good!
I have been using 925-25 for a long time, it is very good, I just received 925-85, the quality of the pen is great, the style is very beautiful, I gave it four stars because the pen is a bit heavy, it is not suitable for fast writing, the pen cap adjusts the length of the lead, there is a bit of wobbling, my personal opinion: 925-25 is more comfortable than 85.
Therefore, he became an Amazon loyalist
I bought it at a super discounted price, but my child doesn't like it.
It has been opened, so I tried to apply for a return, and they even came to my doorstep to pick it up for free.
It's amazing.
We do not advocate returns, but this is the only place in China that offers this service.
I hope it will not be misused.
Later books were all bought here.
The headphones have a distortion and there is noise
These headphones are really trash, I don't know if it's my ears that are the problem, or if these headphones are just not as good as they used to be.
I bought a blue one two years ago on JD.com. The sound quality is good, there is no noise and the bass is also good. I have been using it for more than two years and it has broken down. I plan to buy another one（urbeats）. After all, it feels good.
I saw a purple one that looked pretty good, but when I opened it today, I felt it was not right. The sound was both loud and soft.
At first, I thought it was because of the sound effect of the song, but after listening for half a day, I found that the problem was very serious. Not only was the sound off, but the bass sound was not as good as before, and there were some noise. Is it just me who bought this purple one that has this problem? Or is the current headphone manufacturing technology really not good enough?
A very poor review, I am very disappointed.
I definitely have to return it tomorrow.
PS looks good
This AV amplifier is complicated to set up, has a rough appearance, and generates a lot of heat.
Wait a while before commenting on the sound!
I just got the German version of the DN1080 on August 14th. It looks like the workmanship is poor.
1. The front panel is made of plastic, and the knobs are also plastic.
2. The back panel audio input jack and the speaker output terminals are good or bad, and a CD amplifier with a power of 1000-2000 is much better than this one.
3. The lid is quite thin, and it has sunk in on my transformer, so I had to open the box and use my hands to restore it, and the lid and front panel have become loose.
4. The center of gravity of the whole machine is biased towards the transformer end, and it is very difficult to move.
It feels like a Sony entry-level machine, just like the workmanship, made in Malaysia.
It seems that Sony is better than Little Horse in terms of outsourcing in China.
5. The machine is very hot, and when you use it to watch a movie, the top cover feels about 40-50℃ after two hours, which may be due to the transformer being too large and generating too much heat.
Nowadays, there are multi-purpose switch power supplies, and this idiot transformer is probably about 4 kg.
Sony should use a silent fan with active heat dissipation inside the machine, but after opening the box, I only see large aluminum heat dissipation plates on the pipes.

I haven't taken it apart yet
The battery is in use.
I want to dissect it and see what's inside its belly.
Later, I thought, if I open it and it's disappointing, it's too bad that I spent so much money; if I open it and it's satisfactory, it's hard to put it back together, and it's not as good to use.
Well, even if Sony uses good batteries.
As for the detailed explanation of the electricity, ordinary people will feel dizzy.
I'm okay, I used to work in a cell phone factory for a long time, and I'm half a battery engineer, so I can handle it.
Happy to be here
I really had no idea what I was buying until I opened the package and it felt so right!
Finally, when I touched the headphone wire, it felt particularly flexible, and the quality was so good that I couldn't wait to plug it into my phone and open QQ Music.
I was amazed, the sound quality was 3D surround!
I asked in a physical store, it's about 30 yuan, but it's not a Pengxing brand, it's a generic brand, so I say that although this Pengxing is 27 yuan, it's definitely worth having because of its value for money!
The worst online shopping experience
After placing an order on September 28, the system showed that the order had been shipped, but the goods were not received until October 12.
Check the status of an Amazon order, and the seller has not provided a tracking number, so you can't find out where the order is.
So I sent an email to the seller asking if they could provide the express delivery number, but I didn't get a response for two days.
In desperation, I called Amazon customer service, and the customer service told me the seller's phone number. I called the seller again, and after a few attempts, the call was connected. I was told that the parcel was lost, and I could immediately have a new one sent to me.
Although I was particularly angry, I didn't say much to the seller because I needed the computer urgently.
The next day, I called to ask if the shipment had been sent.
The seller said it hasn't arrived yet, and it won't be sent until this afternoon.
I called again this afternoon and the seller said it would be sent, but it was sent after 5 or 6 pm. I called again at 7 pm and no one answered the phone.
On the third day morning, I called again, and asked if the goods had been sent out.
Can you tell me the order number?
The seller said it was not shipped, and told me to order from another store if I was in a hurry, or to wait until the afternoon if I could wait.
There's no way, I'll have to wait a long time to place an order from someone else.
We can only rely on the seller to send the goods quickly.
After countless phone follow-ups, I received my computer on October 16.
As for the quality of the computer, I don't know, because it was bought for someone else, so I'll add a review later.
I bought it six months ago and haven't used it much, but now it's broken. Can you fix it?
Because there is a desktop computer, I haven't used it much since I bought it.
Just bring it along when you go on a business trip.
When the power is connected recently, it does not charge. You need to use your left and right hands to support the charger and the connection for a few times to charge it.
I suspect that the interface is not in contact, and I don't know if it can be repaired now?
We strongly recommend that Amazon stop using EMS!
The product is five stars, the logistics is one star, and the average is three stars.
I don't understand why Amazon would send EMS, which is not trustworthy in the industry. Well, computers are valuable items, after all!
The order after purchase showed that it was expected to be delivered on the 20th, so my family waited at home for three days!
From Xiamen to Fuzhou, why does it take four or five days?
The logistics company arrived in Fuzhou on the morning of the 22nd, and I was ready to receive the package with a happy heart. However, that night, I received no phone calls or messages. When I checked the logistics company, I found that it had been signed for at noon, and it even showed that I had signed for it myself!
I was shocked at the moment!
Who am I? Where am I? Is this computer really mine?
I seriously doubt whether life is worth living!
I finally picked up the computer from the drop-off point.
The specific reason is simple: the delivery guy mixed up the two order numbers. Fortunately, the package was not lost, so it's okay.
I strongly recommend that Amazon does not use EMS, and in the future, if Amazon uses EMS to send express delivery, I will definitely not buy it again.
The goods are not bad
First of all, I bought it a few days ago and found that it was on sale, with a bad review. The price was not bad, and the cost performance was high. The CPU and graphics card were enough to handle mainstream online games and a considerable number of large single-player games. The heat dissipation was very good, but the screen was a bit dim (a common problem with IPS screens), the sound quality was not very good, and the hard drive was not very good (it is recommended to spend some money to add a solid-state drive). I took the computer to the after-sales service center for hardware testing yesterday, and there were no problems. The built-in Windows 8.1 was not very good, and it is recommended to upgrade to 10. The seller shipped the goods very quickly, and the seller replied to all inquiries very quickly. The invoice arrived the day after I received the computer. It was good, but it was a pity that there were no gifts.
(By the way, when buying keyboard stickers, don't go to a store called E Cool Digital Center on Taobao. They are slow to ship, the quality is poor, and they don't refund or exchange products if there are problems. The boss even swears a lot. I'm exposing this for everyone to see.)
The east and west are good, the platform bureaucracy is still the same
The hard drive quality is very good, the cost-effectiveness is absolutely high, it is cheaper than buying in Hong Kong, and I definitely recommend buying it if you are not in a hurry to use it and can tolerate logistics.
But I have to say that the bureaucracy of the Amazon platform is still the same as it was a few years ago when I vowed to never use it. You can never find out the actual logistics status, the information will always be sent a few weeks later, you can never complain, this is just bureaucracy!
The goods have been received a few days ago, but the logistics information is that you will receive the goods in about 10 days!
Logistics is not a one-time thing
It came like this, not only was the packaging crushed, but the electrical packaging was open, and I don't know if the contents were tampered with.
FYI
I have always trusted Philips, and I hope the battery life is longer than other brands.
I searched online, and it seems to be a common problem with water ingress, and there is no warranty.
I'm bored!
Now wrap it in plastic wrap and continue to use it, but how long can it be used for?
Buy someone else's opened up.
The tax on machines over 300 is indeed quite high, but now I feel more balanced with over 600.
When I received it, the seal looked very strange, like it had been opened, so I took a photo right away. Sure enough, it opened when I tore it, and when I opened it, the paper inside was damaged. I was worried that it was returned by someone else, so I tried it out on my husband right away. Unfortunately, the machine didn't turn on at all, and luckily there was no debris in the blade. If it had been returned by someone else, it would have been a long way to return it!
It is not known whether it is good to use or whether there will be any problems in the short term, as the previous reviews indicate, the things sent out when there is a shortage are not reliable!
Experience is slightly above average
It's almost top-of-the-line electric, with a lot of different brushing modes, but few people change modes every day.
I used it for half a year without any problems, brushing it every day, and it washed once every week or so.
The brush heads are also cheaper on Amazon.
The app is a bit difficult to use, except for changing the color, what other issues are compatible with the overseas version?
Those who want to learn the law.
The price is very reasonable
I have used it 3-4 times.
1. The packaging is complete.
2、使用非常简单，清洗也很方便。
3、完全可以DIY理发，省钱了。
Overall, it was a very successful purchase.
There are counterfeit goods
Last time I bought two packs, they turned out to be two different versions. The words in the lower left corner of the packaging were green, but one of them was not, and the words were white. The cat ate it and got diarrhea.
I'm not sure if Amazon's inventory is fake or if the package was dropped by an employee when it was shipped.
I will buy it again, but if it is still a fake, I will hold you accountable.
It's a crossbar!
The brackets are slanted on Amazon, but they sent me a bracket that is horizontal. Isn't this cheating?
The effect is okay
Cats like to eat, that's the point.
It is also effective.
Tight, narrow, pinching, grinding the heel and the back of the foot.
Not recommended.
1.UN is Clarks' most comfortable series, but this one is too bad.
Additional: Today, I compared the previous UN series of insoles (leaving the insoles for the shoes) and the material is much worse than before, the elasticity is not as good as before, and the breathability is not as good as before, it is just a fake soft.
2. My heel is not very high, and the point where I hit is about 3 cm forward from the highest point of my heel.
3. I bought three pairs of Clarks abroad, but only one pair fits me.
I was so scared that I deleted all the music in my collection.
If it doesn't work, you can only go to the Ecco physical store.
Second best is not good enough, quality control is not good
First of all, it is definitely worth mentioning that Prime Overseas Purchase Ups is very powerful, and I received my order on the 31st.
The shoes look much better in person than in the picture, and the leather feels great.
The shoe size is slightly larger, 25 feet long 10.5 wide 7.5W, the shoes are slightly loose, but I usually like to wear shoes that are a little loose, and I put in a pair of insoles.
Secondly, the shoe control is really not to be praised. One shoe sole has a damaged adhesive, and the other shoe has various scratches and a pinhole, and the adhesive strip at the connection point between the shoe sole and the shoe body is misaligned, which is blatantly inferior!
I regret it a little!
If you buy it for 280 yuan, it's a pretty good deal for Arthur's, and there are even lower prices if you look at the reviews.
Now let's talk about shoes, the pros: the shoes are light, running in them is comfortable, and they fit well, so they won't fall apart.
It looks great but has some obvious flaws: I usually wear a size 40 shoe, and this time I bought a size 40.5, which is about the size of a thumb at the front of the shoe, but that doesn't matter.
These shoes are very "narrow", although there is still some distance between them, but they feel tight.
There is one more thing, the shoes are not breathable and I feel my feet are hot.
Footrest
First of all, the shoes are well made and worth the price.
My feet are quite standard, I wear a size 7.5 running shoes, a size 41.5 sneakers, and a size 6.5 leather shoes. I have bought a few pairs of Amazon's LoveBird shoes, and they have never been uncomfortable, but these shoes are a size 7, and they are noticeably longer than my usual size. However, because the insole is too thick, it is very uncomfortable to wear, and the shoes are very hard, which makes it very difficult to wear them.
If your feet are not particularly thin, we do not recommend buying this product.
If you must buy it, you can replace the insoles, but the original insoles look very high-end, so you don't have to be sorry.
A very perfect shopping experience!
Very satisfied, very much like it, Amazon Global Sourcing is definitely authentic, quality is very good, affordable, safe to buy, after-sales service is very thoughtful, customer service is very friendly and polite, patient and efficient in handling problems, perfectly solved my worries, delivery is very convenient and reliable, the delivery person is very thoughtful and reminds customers to take the goods from the courier box in time, thank you Amazon for providing such a comfortable shopping experience for customers.
In short, we all like shopping on Amazon overseas!
Absolutely negative reviews!
It is really incomprehensible to me that this agency and Amazon are doing this.
In the future, be careful when buying electronic products on Amazon.
Although it has been a long time, I still have to vent.
I bought it on sale in winter, it cost less than 200, and I haven't used it at home for several months.
When I wanted to use it in the spring, I found that it couldn't connect to the watch, and both devices' manuals said they supported each other. Later, I found out that it was probably a problem with the heart rate monitor, because I tried to connect it to other devices and it still couldn't connect.
I called Amazon and asked them to contact the agent company, which then asked me to send the equipment to Shanghai for testing at my own expense.
After almost half a month, the items were sent back to me in their original packaging, including the courier box I used to send them!
No response or acknowledgement, and no test report!
You can tell me whether it's good or bad!
Call and ask, it's good if they say it's okay to send it back like this, indicating that the equipment is not a problem.
But I still can't connect, and the agency responds: That's not their problem.
I'm unlucky, I don't want to be bothered by you for something that costs 200 yuan.
The goods are seriously out of stock.
It's not a very good time to buy.
The material of the headband is very good.
It's much better than Nike.
It is also breathable.
It's just the hat in front.
Very fine.
Are you here to make fun of me?
It completely blocks out the sun.
The reason for not returning the product is because it has a good headband function.
Wearing it on your head will not block the sun.
But it is different from other headband styles.
Keep it.
The quality of the goods is good, Amazon lacks contractual spirit, and the delivery person is good.
I request delivery on Saturday and Sunday!
Amazon's rules do not allow deliveries on Saturdays or Sundays.
I was so annoyed that I drove 200 kilometers from the countryside to pick up the goods!
Amazon, how can I love you again?
The delivery person was very active and enthusiastic.
Give a thumbs up!
The goods are simple, I tried them and they are not bad.
But I have never bought similar products before, so I can't compare them!
Size and logistics
The workmanship is good, but the logistics are too slow. Previously, all of my shoes were delivered by DHL. This time, Apex is... I have bought a lot of UA in China, and the prices are not low. It feels like the quality is higher than NIKE and ADIDAS?
They are all the same, so I buy them online.
Size: I am 176cm tall, weigh 68kg, my shoulders are wide enough that most clothes are 180, I bought M, the hem is slightly long, other than that, I think there are some recommendations for S, are you so slim? Do you like tight clothes? I think the collar shirt is better if it is a bit looser.
Just the right size
Chest size 99, height 184, weight 84 kg, I consulted the customer service before buying and was told to buy XXL, then I saw the reviews and decisively bought L, and after receiving the package, I found that the size was just right, I almost got scammed.
The prices of Double 11 are much higher than those of Black Friday.
The quality of the clothes is very good.
The problem with Z's cheap goods is a pain!
The order placed on the 18th was received on the 25th, the speed from Guangzhou to Beijing is amazing!
I bought the Z Real Deals product, which was advertised as having scratches, but when I received the product, I found that 4 screws and screws were missing!
The child doesn't want to return the item, thinking that the problem is not big, but the accessory is a small part, and the child's grandfather couldn't find it in any of the hardware stores nearby!
Finally, Grandpa put it on!
It seems that we can't buy Z real bargains anymore!
The quality of the toy is poor
Most of the screw holes are not aligned, and it is difficult to screw on the screws, indicating poor processing quality. It is not known how long it can be used, because it is a promise made to children, so it cannot be returned.
Other reviews say it's easy to install, but is it just this one that I bought that has a problem?
Very common
Is it just bad luck?
The packaging is old and unsuitable; the workmanship is very poor; there is only one type of music and it is only 8 seconds long and then repeats; the action is just nodding your head and walking forward, with no changes.
Not worth the price.
If you need it urgently, you can't return it.
The toy is of good quality, but I have some complaints about the packaging
I received the parcel yesterday, which was bought from Amazon, and it was marked as EMS delivery. Finally, it was delivered by the courier of Tmall. How many bends did it take? Is the relationship between Amazon and Tmall still good?
As for the packaging, it is wrapped in several layers of freshness film, and there is no packaging plastic bubble paper inside. When you open it, all the parts are placed in an empty box. The toy quality is good, there are no broken parts, but there are too many parts, because it is not battery-powered, it often derails when pushed by hand, and the gap between the tracks is too large, which is not reasonable.
Good quality, fun
It's a lot of fun, the components are very precise, the workmanship is exquisite, the quality is almost the same as Lego, and the price is very reasonable when organizing activities.
The process of assembling is quite interesting, I come to assemble, my 5-year-old son comes to play, it's fine.
He laughed and laughed while playing it ~ he will probably continue to buy toys of this brand in the future.
Xiaomi new, shopping from overseas is good
I checked out the Christmas items, and the ones I bought before were 150 yuan more expensive, but the new items are slower to ship.
The car is still good, it's all new.
Built-in Pikachu.
Then, if you connect the spirit ball, you will receive a dream.
It's fun to play, and it's more portable than the PS4.
I have already bought Zelda, I'll wait for the game to come out, and then I'll try again.
Produce junk, sell junk, and the result is junk service. I bought six watches for my children, and one of the numbers on one of them is not complete, and the time on all six is not consistent, ranging from a few hours to several hours.
I contacted the manufacturer and asked if there was a time for the watch to be checked when it was put into storage. They replied that there was. If there was, then why was the time so different? That was definitely because the watch didn't have accuracy. In simple terms, it was a counterfeit product. It wasn't my fault. Look, it was obviously a quality problem (the digital display was not complete). They even sold it. Was it a fake product.
I contacted the seller, and the seller said a lot of reasons, and also complained that they should not have bought their products in the first place, such products, such sellers, such after-sales service, who would dare to buy things on Amazon in the future.
In short, I suggest not to buy anything from this seller, even if you buy it, it will be rubbish.
Amazon shipping problems
After receiving the goods, the inspection found:
1. The outer packaging is severely damaged.
2、表说明书有严重使用褶皱。
3. The clock does not work, the desk lamp cannot be charged and cannot be adjusted.
4. Contact Amazon customer service separately, and only pay for shipping to the United States.
5、2分的原因是客服服务还不错。
It's just barely acceptable
The time is not very accurate, about a second a day, and it has been almost two and a half months since I started using it.
I used to use a piece of West Iron City, and I think it won't be off by a few seconds in a year or two.
The calendar function is quite good, but the timer function is a bit useless, and you will rarely use it.
Solar-powered watch
Advantages: solar charging, no need to worry about replacing the battery, world time, multiple alarm clocks and reminders.
Cons: The mirror is easy to scratch and get dusty.
Cost-effective: The domestic price is generally between 220 and 300 yuan, and it takes about a week to get it from overseas.
Very satisfied with the watch
It must be genuine, I checked it in the specialty store, the appearance of the watch is very beautiful, the workmanship is exquisite, the material is sufficient, and it is also an imported mechanical movement, so it has a certain weight, which cannot be compared with those so-called mechanical watches of three or four hundred, this is real.
The watch is very accurate, with errors completely within acceptable limits. The watch comes with a jewelry appraisal certificate, and the 12 diamonds on the dial are real diamonds. It's a great watch to wear and a great gift to give.
The Benly table is indeed good.
The worst shopping experience ever
On the evening of September 23, my wife dropped her phone, and I immediately ordered an 8p from Amazon. It was in stock but not self-sold and without a markup (secretly happy), but because it was not self-sold, the delivery was slower, and the system showed that the expected delivery date was September 27.
My wife was so upset that she didn't have a phone, so she called me early in the morning at 6:30 to think about it. Later, I checked JD.com and found that there were 256G products available for delivery on the same day. I had to immediately order another one.
I just bought it, and I want to cancel Amazon's order right away.
Because the order was placed in the middle of the night, it was impossible to pick up the parcel at midnight. At around 7:00, I called customer service to cancel the order, and the customer service representative replied that the order had been canceled and to wait for a text message notification.
Okay, I'll be patient and check my phone at noon. The order is still in the status of not shipped. I immediately contacted customer service to request an urgent cancellation of the order. The customer service replied that it has been processed.
At 3 pm, I checked my phone and found that the order was still pending. I had no choice but to contact customer service again to clarify that I had called three times, please cancel the order and notify the seller not to ship the goods!
The customer service contacted the seller on my request and informed me that the seller was not familiar with the system and that I should wait until the seller was familiar with the system before canceling the order.
But I was clearly told by the seller that they knew about it and would definitely not ship it, so please rest assured.
I checked the order status on Monday and found that it had been shipped, and I was speechless.
Because I couldn't directly contact the seller, I had to call customer service again.
The handling afterwards was simply incomprehensible, with most of the time I would say one thing and the customer service would then proceed to do something else.
The order is still in the status of refusal to accept delivery, and we are preparing to send it again!
Will Amazon not take the initiative to follow up?
The seller's company has already received the money, so it doesn't matter if they don't follow up.
In the future, we will definitely not pre-pay for large items, this is too troublesome.
It looks beautiful.
I had been eyeing this camera for a long time, but I didn't buy it because of some other reasons besides the price, but this time I bought it because it was a bundle deal and the price was still reasonable.
After buying it, there were no problems with the other things, but when I tried to connect the software, I couldn't connect. My router is a TP router. After searching online, I found that many people had this problem. I spent more than two hours changing the settings of the router, and finally, I used 360WIFI as a medium to solve the problem. In the meantime, I called Xiaomi customer service, but they didn't have any solutions to this problem. They directly told me to contact Amazon for after-sales service.
Another thing worth noting is that I saw a user's comment online saying that the camera supports a minimum of 8G storage card, and smaller storage capacity cannot be recognized, so please pay attention to this.
It feels good to use, the picture is acceptable, but the sound quality is poor, the machine has a certain degree of heating, and if it is on all the time, the degree of heating is a bit hard to accept.
In summary, this product has many shortcomings, so please be careful when buying it.
I gave it 3 stars because I bought it for my first love, and we have been dating for almost 3 years. He left me last year, and I still haven't gotten over it.
I gave it 3 stars because I bought it for my first love, but I don't know how much I'll use it now, or maybe I've thrown it away!
We have been together for three years, and she left me last year. Whenever I think of her, I feel so sad that I want to leave this world. The first woman in my life, she has cast a shadow and pain on my life that I have not been able to get over yet.
When I bought this phone, I thought about the two of us sharing the same hardships, but now it's unbearable to think about. Maybe that's just how life is. Some people don't want to meet some people in their lifetime, and some things they don't want to know about in their lifetime. But what can we do?
Every time I see a Samsung phone, I think of her. The pain that comes with it fills my entire body. I have never been willing to spend more than 2,000 yuan on a phone, but when I bought it for her, I didn't hesitate. No matter how much I love someone, if they change their mind, all the promises and vows in the world will be meaningless.
The best of the domestic brands
Huawei is a premium product among national brands.
The low-key CEO and the enterprise rely on technology and quality to win customers, which is completely different from the current business trend of relying on advertising to improve brand awareness!
A company without strength is not capable of doing this, and it is also not daring to do this!
It is precisely because of this that I chose Huawei.
I've been using it for more than half a year, and it's been working great, very good.
The reason why it didn't get a full score is because there was a time when I used it offline navigation and it showed no location, and I couldn't find the reason. Other times it worked fine.
Moreover, it has an online input function that automatically designs a route after searching, and it automatically navigates offline after leaving Wi-Fi. It doesn't use traffic, and it directly communicates with satellites to achieve positioning and navigation, which is very good!
Sony is great
Sony's low-end machine still has a strong design sense, and it is cheap, the screen is big enough, the battery life is great, and it is very suitable for the elderly to use.
Although a long time has passed, this machine still works fine.
However, since my Z2 has been downgraded, this phone has also fulfilled its mission.
