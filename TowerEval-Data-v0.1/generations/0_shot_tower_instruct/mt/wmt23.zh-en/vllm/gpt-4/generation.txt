4.1 Overview
The characters in this document are recorded in single-byte, double-byte, or four-byte encoding.
The single-byte part includes all 128 characters from 0x00 to 0x7F of GB/T 11383-1989.
4.3 Double Byte Section
The double-byte section includes all the graphic characters in GB/T 2312-1980, the CJK Unified Ideographs in GB/T 13000, and some graphic characters.
The characters of the double-byte part are in accordance with the provisions of Appendix A.
Among them, the graphics, code positions, and functions of the ideographic character descriptors should comply with the regulations in Appendix B.
Note: GB/T 13000 standardizes the encoding of Chinese characters used in countries and regions such as China, Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam.
Chinese characters with unique abstract shapes are assigned individual code positions; Chinese characters with the same abstract shapes but different origins are assigned shared code positions.
The encoded Chinese characters are called CJK Unified Ideographs, where CJK stands for China, Japan, and Korea.
4.4 Four-byte section
The four-byte section includes 66 CJK Unified Ideographs (9FA6 to 9FEF, excluding 8 characters from 9FB4 to 9FBB) from GB/T 13000 beyond the aforementioned double-byte characters, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension C, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension D, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension F, and characters of minority ethnic scripts that have already been encoded in GB/T 13000.

5 Overall Structure
In the main text, numbers preceded by 0x are represented in hexadecimal, and those not preceded by 0x are represented in decimal.
In the appendix, all coded representations are in hexadecimal, while all other numerical representations are in decimal.
The single-byte part uses the encoding structure of GB/T 11383-1989, using the 0x00~0x7F code position.
The double-byte contribution part uses two eight-bit binary bit strings to represent a character, with the first byte code ranging from 0x81 to 0xFE, and the tail byte code is respectively 0x40 to 0x7E and 0x80 to 0xFE.
The four-byte section uses the unused 0x30 to 0x39 from GB/Work 11383-1989 as a suffix for expanding the double-byte encoding, with an encoding range of 0x81308130 to 0xFE39FE39.
The encoding range for the first byte of a four-byte character is 0x81 to 0xFE; the second byte is 0x30 to 0x39; the third byte is 0x81 to 0xFE; the fourth byte is 0x30 to 0x39. That is: 0x81308130 to 0x81308139; 0x81308230 to 0x81308239; 0x8130FEFE30 to 0x8130FE39; 0x81318130 to 0x81318139; Oo2douolag0c “0URo23061393 0xFE39FE30 to 0xFE39FE39.

The content of this manual page is excerpted from the complete documentation of the GNU C compiler, and is limited to explaining the meaning of options.
Unless someone voluntarily maintains it, the EURo file, Info file is the authoritative document.
If you find any contradictions between the manual page and the software, please check the Info.
If we find that the content of this manual page is causing significant confusion and complaints due to being outdated, we will stop publishing it. There is no other choice, such as updating the Info file and the man manual at the same time, because other maintenance work on Gnu cc does not leave us time to do this. The GNU project considers the man manual to be an outdated product, and time should be spent elsewhere.
If you need complete and up-to-date documentation, please refer to the Info file `gee' or the Using and Porting GNU CC (for version 2.0) (ft&/HAIZE#H GNU CC 2.0) manual. Both are derived from the Texinfo source file gee. texinfo.
The C and C++ compilers are integrated. They both process input files using one or more of the following four steps: preprocessing, compilation (Hii), assembly (MERE), and linking.
The suffix of the source file indicates the language of the source file, but for the compiler, the suffix controls the default settings.
gcc considers the preprocessed files (.i) as C files, and sets up connections in C format.
G++ considers the preprocessed files (.i) as C++ files, and sets the connection in C++ format.
The suffix of the source file indicates the type of language and the subsequent operations:
C source code; preprocessing, compiling, assembly
C C++ source code; preprocessing, compiling, assembly
.cc C++ source code; preprocessing, compiling, assembly
CXX C++ source code; preprocessing, compiling, assembly
Objective-C source code; preprocessing, compiling, assembly

Assembly language source program; Assembly

.h preprocessor file; usually does not appear on the command line, other subsequent file names are passed to the linker. Usually includes:
Object File
Archive file
Unless the -cec, -s, or -E options are used (or a compilation error prevents the complete process), linking is always the final step.
During the linking phase, all .e files corresponding to the source program, -1 library files, and unrecognizable filenames (including specified .o H label files and .a library files) are passed to the linker options (OPTIONS) in the order specified in the command line.
The options must be given separately: 'de' is completely different from '-d -r'.
The majority of `-E' and `-W' options have two opposing formats: -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno-name).
Here only lists the formats that are not the default options.
Below is a summary of all the options, grouped by type, with explanations provided in the subsequent sections.
Code Generation Option
Overall Option
Clearly indicate that the language of the input file in the back is language (rather than the default selection obtained from the file name).
This option applies to all subsequent input files until the next `-x' option is encountered. The language is optional.
Close any explicit instructions for languages, therefore, process the files behind based on the file name suffix RE AS E `-x' option).
If you only operate a part of the four stages (preprocessing, compiling, assembling, linking), you can use the `-x' option (or Ah after the file name) to tell geo where to start, and use the `~-c', `-s', or `-E' options to tell geo where to end. Note that some option combinations (for example, `-x cpp-output -E') compile or assemble source files, ETER. ERA ATI. By default, GCC replaces the source file name with `.o' and `.ec' after the file name. You can use the -o option to choose other names. GCC ignores any unrecognized input after the -ec option -S F whatever.
Target file that has been processed.
After compilation, it stops and does not proceed with assembly.
During the compilation process, pipelines are used instead of temporary files for work, because the assemblers of those systems cannot read data from pipelines. This is not a problem for GNU assemblers, which can accept the C "dialect": they support C programs that conform to the ANSI standard.
This will disable certain keywords in GNU Cc that are not compatible with ANSI Cc, as well as rarely used ANSI trigraph features such as unix and vax. It also prohibits the use of all standard libraries available in the hosted environment (note: in the hosted environment, the main function returns an int value, a typical example is almost all programs except the kernel. In the corresponding freestanding environment, there is no standard library, and the program entry point is not necessarily main, the most obvious example is the operating system kernel. For more details, refer to the latest information on the gcc website).
For function declarations without parameters, such as `int foo ();', handle it in the C-style --- that is, do not specify the number or type of parameters. (Only applicable to C++).
Under normal circumstances, such a function foo in C++ means that the parameters are empty.
The list of sections is deleted here in an attempt to support certain aspects of the traditional C compiler.
Refer to the NU c manual, we have already deleted the details, so people won't be confused when the content becomes outdated.
Except for one thing: for C++ programs (not C), the `-traditional' option brings an additional effect, allowing assignment to this.
He and the `-Ethis-is-variable' option are the same.
Attempting to support certain aspects of the traditional Cc preprocessor.
Especially the content mentioned above about preprocessors, but does not include the other effects of the `-traditional' option.
-fdollars-in-identifiers allows the use of the '$' character in identifiers (only for C++).
You can specify the `"-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' option to explicitly prohibit the use of the `$' symbol.
(GNU C++ allows the '$' symbol by default on some target systems, but not on all systems.)
-fenum-int-equiv allows implicit conversion from ant type to enumeration type (MEF c++).
Under normal circumstances, GNU C++ allows conversion from enum to int, but not the other way around.
The -fexternal-templates generates smaller code for template declarations (only applicable to C++), by creating only one copy for each template function at the place where they are defined.
To successfully use this option, you must mark `#pragma implementation' (definition) or `#pragma interface' (declaration) in all files using the template.
When the program is compiled with `-fexternal-templates', all template instantiations are of external type. You must ensure that the required instances appear in the implementation file.
This can be achieved through typedef, it references each required instance.
Correspondingly, if the default option `-fno-exteznal-templates' is used during compilation, all template instances are explicitly set to built-in.
All member functions (except for constructor functions and mnew or delete member operators) are considered virtual functions of the class they belong to.
This does not indicate that every call to the member function will go through the internal virtual function table.
In some cases, the compiler can determine that a virtual function can be called directly; at this time, it is called directly.
-fcond-mismatch allows the types of the second and third arguments of the conditional expression to not match.
The value of this expression is Void. -fthis-—is-variable allows assigning a value to this (only for c++).
After integrating the user-defined free storage management mechanism into C++, the assignable 'this' seems outdated.
Therefore, by default, assigning a value to 'this' within a class member function is an invalid operation.
However, for backward compatibility, you can enable this operation through the `-fthis-is-variable' option.
-funsigned-char defines char as an unsigned type, similar to unsigned char.
All kinds of machines have their own default char type. It could either be unsigned char or signed char.
Ideally, when dependent on the symbolic nature of data, a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned char.
However, many programs have been written using only simple char, and it is expected that this is a signed number (or an unsigned number, depending on the target machine for which the program is written).
This option, and its opposite option, make such a program work on the corresponding default values.
The type of char should always be explicitly defined as signed char or unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly like one of them.
If there is no explicit declaration of the 'signed' or 'unsigned' modifier, these options are used to define signed bitfields or unsigned bitfields.
By default, bit fields are signed because they inherit from basic integer types, such as int, which are signed. However, if the `-traditional' option is specified, bit fields are always unsigned.
-fwritable-strings stores string constants in the writable data segment, and does not treat them specially.
This is to ensure compatibility with some old programs. They think changing string constants is a very bad idea. The '-traditional' option has the same effect.
Executive Summary
The Impact of COVID-19 on the Drug Market
Its impact could be similar to the economic crisis of 2008.
The global COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the world into an unprecedented crisis.
In many countries, this disease has overwhelmed healthcare services to the point of near collapse, and the restrictive measures implemented by various governments have caused serious disruption in the global economy.
The impact of the epidemic on the drug market is still unclear and difficult to predict, but it could potentially have far-reaching effects.
Some producers may be forced to seek new methods to manufacture drugs, as restrictions on movement also limit the acquisition of precursors and basic chemicals.
Smugglers may have to find new routes and methods due to travel restrictions preventing them from crossing borders.
The patterns of drug use and supply may change, and the government's ability to respond may also be hindered.
The changes brought about by COVID-19 are unprecedented, but we can still learn some lessons from past crises.
After the 2008 economic crisis, some drug users began to look for cheaper synthetic substances, shifting their usage pattern towards injecting drugs.
Meanwhile, governments around the world have cut budgets related to drugs.
If governments around the world respond to the current economic recession in the same way, preventive measures against drug use and related risky behaviors, as well as drug treatment services, could take a heavy hit.
In addition, the priority of interception actions and international cooperation may decrease, making it easier for traffickers to operate.
Some countries have a large amount of drugs smuggled through commercial flights, and it is estimated that the direct impact of drug trafficking activities in these countries is the greatest.
Couriers often carry synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine in their personal backpacks or hidden in their private luggage, sometimes in large quantities. Due to restrictions on air passenger transport almost everywhere, activities supplying drugs through commercial air travel may be completely interrupted.
Despite disruptions to the international postal supply chain, activities involving trafficking through the dark web and parcel post may increase.
In the long run, economic recession and related lockdown measures may disrupt the drug market.
Due to the rising unemployment rate and lack of opportunities, impoverished and vulnerable groups are more likely to resort to drug use in harmful ways, develop drug-related diseases, and turn to illegal activities related to drugs, whether it's production or transportation.
Drug trafficking organizations may take advantage of this situation, providing services to vulnerable populations, and recruiting new members to strengthen their ranks.
As the government's response capacity decreases, these changes may quickly take root, becoming the new reality for many communities.
Expansion and Complexity
Market Growth
The pattern of population growth partially explains the reason for market expansion.
The phenomenon of drug abuse is increasing worldwide, both in terms of total numbers and the proportion of drug users in the world population.
In 2009, it was estimated that there were 210 million drug users, accounting for 4.8% of the global population aged 15-64. By 2018, the estimated number of drug users had risen to 269 million, representing 5.3% of this age group.
Over the past twenty years, the rate of drug abuse in developing countries has grown much faster than in developed countries.
This to some extent reflects the difference in overall population growth during this period, with developed countries at 7% and developing countries at 28%. However, it also reflects the faster growth of the young population in developing countries.
Adolescents and young adults constitute the largest proportion among drug users.
During the period from 2000 to 2018, the population in this age group in developing countries increased by 16%, while the population in the same age group in developed countries decreased by 10%.
Urbanization is a driving factor in the current and future drug market.
Whether in developed or developing countries, the incidence of drug use in urban areas is higher than in rural areas.
One of the reasons for the overall increase in drug use is the large-scale migration of people from rural to urban areas. Currently, more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas, while in 1960, this ratio was 34%.
Urbanization could be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, especially in developing countries where the trend of urbanization is more prominent.
The increase in wealth is associated with an increase in drug use, but the greatest burden of disease is borne by the poorest people worldwide. Drug use is more common in developed countries than in developing countries.
Drugs like cocaine are even more strongly linked to the wealthier regions of the world.
Similarly, within various countries, the prevalence of drug use is higher among the affluent social classes.
However, the rate of turning to drug addiction is higher among people with lower socio-economic status.
Data from a few countries indicate that there is a connection between harmful drug use patterns and illnesses with low income.
These patterns seem to be less common in wealthier social classes.
The global COVID-19 crisis is likely to exacerbate the risks faced by the most vulnerable groups, including drug users, due to economic constraints.
For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment rates, have always been associated with an increase in drug use, and this pandemic has already forced tens of millions of people worldwide to become unemployed.
The COVID-19 pandemic may lead to further expansion of the drug market. The widespread pandemic could cause more farmers to increase or engage in the cultivation of illegal crops, either due to the reduced control capacity of national authorities, or because more people may have to take risks and engage in illegal activities in the face of an economic crisis.
The related restrictions of COVID-19 have led to a reduction in air and land traffic, potentially increasing maritime smuggling due to its lower interception risk and higher quantity compared to air or land smuggling.
Recent reports have stated that cocaine shipments are being directly transported from South America to Europe by sea.
Complexity increases
The presence of non-internationally regulated substances remains stable, but new types of potentially harmful opioids are increasing, making the drug market increasingly complex.
In addition to plant-based substances such as cannabis, cocaine, and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control. The non-medical use of drugs is also rapidly increasing.
Approximately 500 new active substances appear on the domestic markets of member countries each year.
Currently, the majority of them are stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists, and a small amount of opiate-like substances.
Although the overall quantity of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportion has changed.
In the total number of new psychoactive substances identified in 2014, opiate-like new psychoactive substances accounted for only 2%, but by 2018, this figure had risen to 9%.
Many substances in the new type of opiate-like psychoactive substances are analogues of fentanyl, whose efficacy and harm have been proven. They have caused overdose death incidents in North America, and also in other regions, but to a lesser extent.
In North America, fentanyl is used as an adulterant for heroin and other drugs (including cocaine and methamphetamine), and some is used to manufacture counterfeit medicinal opioids.
Some evidence suggests that there is also a phenomenon of injecting new psychoactive stimulants in Europe: a study on the residues of discarded syringes in six European cities found that many syringes were contaminated with new psychoactive substances that produce a stimulating effect.
The use of 2 new psychoactive substances may gradually become firmly established among vulnerable groups.
New types of psychoactive substances from a single category have almost never formed a large market.
However, evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among socially marginalized groups such as the homeless and prison inmates.
22 countries have reported the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, with most countries identifying synthetic cannabinoids as the main challenge.
The regulation of precursor chemicals forces drug manufacturers to innovate. Many chemicals used as precursors to synthesize drugs such as amphetamine, methamphetamine, and "ecstasy" have been placed under international control.
Drug traffickers and manufacturers are always looking for alternatives, not only substances with looser regulations, but also chemicals specifically designed to evade regulation, known as "specially designed precursors."
Restrictive measures aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19 are likely to further squeeze drug manufacturers who rely on precursor chemicals.
Evidence from Mexico suggests that this has become a reality: according to reports, in March 2020, a shortage of methamphetamine precursors imported from East Asia led to a rise in the price of methamphetamine in Mexico and the United States.
The market changes in the blink of an eye.
Synthetic drugs are replacing opium in Central Asia and the Russian Federation.
The opium market in Central Asia and the Russian Federation seems to have changed between 2008 and 2018.
The amount of opium intercepted by the Russian Federation authorities has decreased by approximately 80%, and the number of people receiving treatment for opium use has significantly decreased.
However, the market for stimulants seems to be thriving day by day.
There is evidence to suggest that methamphetamine and various cathinones, including methoxymethcathinone and a-pyrrolidinopentiophenone, are now ubiquitous in the Russian drug market.
Russian authorities report that the number of secret processing points for the production of various illegal drugs has sharply increased recently, more than doubling in two years, rising to 152 processing points in 2018.
Growth in the Methamphetamine Market in Afghanistan and Iraq
As early as 2012, investigations into hospital, prison, and other institutional personnel had already revealed the significance of methamphetamine in Iraq.
Crystalline methamphetamine has become another major drug of concern, in addition to Fentanyl and Tramadol.
A 2015 study further confirmed these findings, with drug users indicating that marijuana is harder to obtain than "fentanyl" or methamphetamine.
Recently, Iraqi authorities have discovered several methamphetamine processing sites. The Narcotics Bureau has expressed concern over the large-scale import of pseudoephedrine preparations, as these preparations are used as precursors at methamphetamine processing sites.
In Afghanistan, the production of methamphetamine seems to have begun in 2014.
Since then, the seizure amount of methamphetamine has been steadily increasing.
However, the amount seized in the first half of 2019 was 657 kilograms - a significant increase compared to the previous year.
Large amounts of methamphetamine believed to originate from Afghanistan have been seized in other countries, indicating that the country's production is rapidly increasing.
Policy changes and changing trends
Jurisdictions where the legalization of marijuana for non-medical use has occurred tend to see an increase in marijuana usage.
Eleven jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay, and the United States allow the production of cannabis products for non-medical use.
In most jurisdictions where marijuana use has been legalized, there has been an increase in use, although the same trend has been observed in jurisdictions where non-medical use of marijuana has not been legalized.
In the first two states in the United States to legalize marijuana, Colorado and Washington, the non-medical use of marijuana among adults has increased, especially in the past month and the frequency of daily or almost daily use. Since 2012, it has exceeded the national average.
All indicators show that since 2011, the use of marijuana in Uruguay has increased, with last month's usage almost doubling.
This indicates that the main reason for the increase is the frequent and regular use of marijuana.
Short-term data from Canada also indicates that as the legal market expanded from 2018 to 2019, usage also increased.
However, in 2019, 40% of cannabis users still obtained some products from illegal sources.
Is the reason behind the drastic drop in global cannabis seizures the legalization of marijuana?
In 2018, the global seizure of cannabis fell to its lowest level in 20 years, due to a decrease in seizures in North America, which dropped by 84% over the past 10 years.
In comparison, the amount seized in other regions of the world during the same period almost doubled. The pattern of seizures indicates that policies aimed at liberalizing the cannabis market played a key role in the decline.
The regulation of new psychoactive substances seems to have a restraining effect, but it is still difficult to assess the effectiveness of such regulation within the country.
Countries that adopt different regulatory systems for new psychoactive substances show different prevalence rates of use of these substances.
In some other countries, the use of new psychoactive substances has decreased after domestic legislation.
Vulnerable groups face harm from both legal and illegal drug markets. Medicinal opioids used for pain management and palliative care are primarily provided in high-income countries, resulting in an uneven distribution of painkillers across different regions.
In 2018, over 90% of all medically consumable opiates were in high-income countries.
Approximately 50% are in North America, 40% are in Europe, and 2% are in Oceania.
The population of these countries accounts for approximately 12% of the global population.
It is estimated that the population of low and middle-income countries accounts for 88% of the global population, but they consume less than 10% of medicinal opioids.
Obtaining medicinal opioids is associated with many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems, and prescription practices.
People who are poorer are at a greater risk of suffering from drug addiction. In 2018, approximately 35.6 million people suffered from drug addiction.
Poverty, limited education, and social marginalization may increase the risk of drug addiction and exacerbate its consequences. This has been confirmed by research in high-income countries, where studies have shown that an individual's adverse socio-economic trajectory is not only related to their status at a certain point in time, but also associated with the risk of drug addiction.
Drug addiction can also exacerbate socio-economic disadvantages, further increasing the risk of unemployment, poverty, and homelessness, thereby fueling a vicious cycle of disadvantage. These outcomes may also be related to the derogatory attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.
Women, ethnic minorities and immigrants, diverse sexual orientation groups, people displaced by armed conflict or disaster, and those in rural environments may also be disproportionately affected by drug addiction, or encounter problems in accessing treatment services.
According to the Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) index, which estimates the number of healthy life years lost due to disability and premature death, the harmful effects of drug abuse have exacerbated the broader social impact over the past 10 years.
From 2007 to 2018, the global disability-adjusted life years attributed to drug use increased by 17%.
The increase in the number of years of life adjusted for disability due to untreated hepatitis C leading to liver cancer among intravenous drug users is particularly high - reaching 40%.
The relationship between drugs and violence is complex and it is difficult to determine all the causal relationships between the use of psychoactive substances and violence.
Limited global data suggests that intoxication may be a significant factor in homicides.
However, in violent incidents, the role of alcohol seems to be greater than that of drugs.
Although drug use may lead to crime, in some cases, this connection can be partly attributed to various intermediary factors, such as socio-economic disadvantages and other types of adversity caused by individual risks, family environment, and peer influence.
The connection between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.
If there is already a stable criminal structure, large-scale organized criminal activities, including international drug trafficking, could possibly be carried out without violence.
In the short term, the presence and extent of violence depend less on the amount of trafficking, and more on certain changes that destabilize the balance of power between organized crime groups, such as changes in the size of the illegal market, the death or imprisonment of notorious criminals, and law enforcement measures that weaken one group relative to another.
Latest Trend
Marijuana is the most commonly used substance, and opioids pose the greatest harm.
It is estimated that in 2018, 192 million people used marijuana, making it the most widely used drug globally.
In comparison, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.
However, the related harms of opiate drugs are often overlooked due to the fewer number of users.
Of the estimated 167,000 deaths related to drug use disorders in 2017, 66% were caused by such substances. Of the 21 million years of life lost due to disabilities or premature deaths believed to be caused by drug use, 50% were caused by such substances.
The non-medical use of synthetic opioids has exacerbated the public health crisis.
In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, the opioid crisis is exacerbated by Tramadol; in North America, it is Fentanyl. These two regions have almost no commonalities in terms of economy, demographic data, or general drug use patterns, but both are struggling to combat the opioid crisis fueled by easily accessible and low-cost substances.
In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has led to an increase in the number of opioid overdose deaths over the past 20 years.
In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths registered in the United States involved fentanyl.
Canada also reported similar results, just with lower numbers.
One of the reasons for fentanyl-related overdose deaths is the unpredictable potency of fentanyl on the illegal drug market.
In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, the market for non-medical use of Tramadol has seen significant growth.
In this region, an increasing number of patients with symptoms are receiving treatment with Truvada.
In 2017, the global interception of Tramadol significantly increased, reaching a peak of over 125 tons.
However, in 2018, after India passed a new law regulating Khat, the global seizure volume dropped to 32 tons.
The crisis in these two places was brought about by simple manufacturing and low production costs, in addition to the lack of international regulation for Quma Duo and many similar substances or their precursors.
What exacerbates the crisis in these two places is that these substances are supplied in both the pharmaceutical market and the illegal market, making it even more difficult to detect and prevent their abuse.
The use of stimulants is constantly increasing.
In the field of stimulants, cocaine and methamphetamine are predominant, and the usage of these two substances is on the rise in their main markets.
In 2018, approximately 19 million people used cocaine, as it is quite popular in North America and Western Europe.
In the same year, approximately 27 million people used amphetamines, among which methamphetamine was the most commonly used type of amphetamine stimulant in Southeast Asia and North America.
According to the majority of indicators obtained, the use of methamphetamine in these two regions has been expanding for the past 20 years.
In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist, sometimes substituting for each other. When the usage of one drug increases, the usage of the other decreases, and sometimes they both increase or decrease simultaneously to meet the same market demand.
The risk for drug users who inject has increased due to COVID-19.
It is estimated that in 2018, there were about 11.3 million people who used drugs by injection, and approximately 10% of global HIV infections were caused by injecting drug use.
Over one million injection drug users are infected with the HIV virus, and 5.5 million people are suffering from Hepatitis C.
In 2017, approximately 585,000 people died from drug abuse, half of whom died from liver disease caused by hepatitis C. Most of the hepatitis C among drug users who inject drugs remains untreated.
The restrictions caused by COVID-19 leading to a shortage of opioids may cause users to substitute them with more readily available substances such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or mix opioids with synthetic drugs.
As some users switch to injections or inject more frequently, more harmful methods of use may emerge.

EU Summit debates refugee policy, EU official: Reception process faces continuous bottlenecks - China News Network
The EU summit is in constant dispute over refugee policy, EU officials: there are bottlenecks at every step of the acceptance process.
According to a report by Agence France-Presse on February 10, at the latest EU summit that day, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that EU leaders have agreed to implement stricter policies on the issue of illegal immigration, making it easier to expel illegal immigrants.
According to reports, the EU's move is a response to the growing concern over illegal immigration in Europe. Now, the core issue for the EU is that very few illegal immigrants can ultimately be deported.
According to the summit documents, EU leaders called on the Commission to "immediately mobilize a large amount of EU funds" to strengthen external borders through means such as infrastructure and surveillance.
However, the EU and its member countries are constantly arguing over issues such as the payment of fence costs.
Feng Delaine has repeatedly stated that EU funds will not cover the related costs.
However, diplomats from some member countries stated that if Europe could share the burden of installing cameras, watchtowers, and other infrastructure along the external borders, it would free up national budgets and thus accelerate the construction process.
The European Euractiv website reports that EU officials admit that there are bottlenecks at every step of the refugee reception process. The limited reception capacity and overburdened immigration authorities of member states are unable to prevent refugees from submitting "countless" asylum applications in EU countries. The EU's refugee reception system is in a near "permanent crisis".
According to estimates by the European Commission, Schengen countries in the EU received over 920,000 asylum applications last year, nearly half more than the previous year.
Meanwhile, the EU recorded over 330,000 illegal entries last year.
Under this context, the summit also reached an agreement on a "principle", that is, EU countries can deport illegal immigrants back to their home countries based on the court decision of another member country.
In addition, the report said, EU leaders also agreed to "increase the use of the concept of a secure state," which will pave the way for the EU to develop a common list.

US Escalates "Chip War" Severely Damaging Global Semiconductor Industry - China News Service
Recently, the United States' "chip war" against China has shown signs of escalating. First, under pressure from the United States, the Netherlands and Japan agreed to initiate controls on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China. Later, foreign media reported that the U.S. government is considering severing all ties between U.S. suppliers and Huawei, prohibiting U.S. suppliers from providing any products to Huawei. The Biden administration is also preparing to announce an executive order restricting U.S. investment in China's sensitive technology industry. Not long after the start of 2023, the United States has been continuously employing harsh measures to curb the development of China's semiconductor-related industries.
In recent years, the United States has never ceased its efforts to suppress China's "core" development. On one hand, it precisely suppresses the semiconductor supply chain to China, and on the other hand, it is building a "de-Sinicized" semiconductor industry chain alliance, aiming to completely "shake off" China in the advanced semiconductor industry.
Whether it's courting South Korea to establish a "technology alliance", or setting up a chip "quadrilateral alliance" with South Korea, Japan, and the Taiwan region of China, or even establishing a "small circle" of the semiconductor industry chain through mechanisms such as the US-Japan-India-Australia "quadrilateral mechanism" and the "Indo-Pacific economic framework", the United States is attempting to build a closed supply chain cycle dominated by itself by introducing politicized, factionalized, and weaponized means into the semiconductor industry. This is in an attempt to compensate for its shortcomings in chip manufacturing and maintain its advantageous position in the global chip industry.
However, the United States' high-profile "chip strategy" against China is also a case of "harming the enemy a thousand, but self-damaging eight hundred".
Recently, the well-known American chip manufacturing equipment supplier, Panlin Group, announced that due to the impact of the latest round of export bans on chip manufacturing equipment to China, the group will lay off 1300 full-time employees and plans to lay off another 1400 temporary employees in the next two quarters.
The global lithography giant, ASML Holding NV of the Netherlands, recently warned that banning the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to an increase in semiconductor prices.
According to analysis by American media, after the U.S. government's aggressive crackdown on China's chip and semiconductor industries, many American companies have been severely affected. These include developers of electronic design automation tools, chip designers, manufacturers of wafer production equipment, and the chip manufacturers themselves.
The so-called suppression of China's advanced semiconductor industry by the United States has dragged down the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain.
The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, and a closely connected global semiconductor industry chain has long been formed.
According to professionals, based on specialized division of labor, the entire production process of semiconductor products needs to cross national borders more than 70 times, taking up to 100 days in total.
Despite the strong foundation of the semiconductor industry in the United States, its manufacturing capabilities, especially in advanced process technology, are relatively weak and heavily dependent on the East Asia region.
Even if the United States strongly guides the advanced chip production and supply chain towards a US-led "small circle" regional development, it is difficult to change the regional distribution and interdependence of the global semiconductor-related industries.
The United States' strong "reshaping" and "de-Sinicization" of the semiconductor industry chain has severely impacted the global semiconductor industry.
The chip is the core of the global future industry, and the development of the chip industry cannot be separated from the participation of all countries around the world.
In recent years, the United States has taken a series of unilateral actions, successively introducing the "Innovation and Competition Act", the "2022 American Competition Act", and the "Chips and Science Act", leveraging its technological hegemony to consolidate its leading advantage in technology. It has used both carrot and stick tactics with its allies, enticing and pressuring chip manufacturers such as Intel, TSMC, and Samsung to set up factories in the US, striving to ensure America's global leadership in the chip industry.
In the short term, the United States has indeed caused trouble for the development of China's chip industry and related industries, reaping tangible benefits.
In the long run, the hysterical suppression by the United States forces the Chinese chip industry to continuously make breakthroughs, causing it to lose the huge Chinese market. This will ultimately greatly weaken the innovative willingness and capability of American technology companies, damaging the development of the global chip industry.

The first batch of personal pension wealth management products goes on sale, with a minimum holding period of 360 days - China News Network
The first batch of personal pension wealth management products goes on sale
Seven products from the home institution are available, with the shortest holding period being 360 days.
The personal pension financial product has finally been launched.
On February 10, China Wealth Network released the first batch of personal pension wealth management product list. Seven personal pension wealth management products from ICBC Wealth Management, ABC Wealth Management, and China Post Wealth Management officially went on sale.
At this point, the "shelf" of individual pension accounts has finally gathered four types of products: individual pension savings, individual pension wealth management, individual pension insurance, and individual pension public mutual funds.
According to the introduction, the first batch of personal pension wealth management products are all publicly raised net value open-ended products, including 5 newly issued products and 2 existing products. Except for one mixed-type product, the remaining 6 products are all fixed-income products.
The Beijing Youth Daily reporter noted that, out of the five newly launched products, four are from ICBC Wealth Management, all of which are fixed income products. The shortest holding periods are 365 days, 540 days, 720 days, and 1080 days respectively, with corresponding performance benchmarks (annualized) of 3.70% - 4.20%, 4.10% - 4.60%, 4.40% - 4.90%, and 5.25% - 5.75% respectively.
The remaining new product is "Postal Bank Wealth Addition·Hongjin with a minimum holding period of 1095 days No.1", which is also a fixed income product. The fundraising began on February 10 and ended on February 19, with a risk level of two.
Of the two existing products, one is the Agricultural Bank of China's "Agricultural Bank United Heart · Agile" 360-day technology innovation RMB wealth management product, with a mixed investment nature and a risk level of three.
Another existing product is "Postal Savings Bank Wealth Addition·Hongjin with a minimum holding period of 365 days No.1", a fixed income type. It started fundraising on December 30 last year, officially operated on January 4 this year, and its cumulative net value was 1.0011 on February 8.
According to the "Opinions of the State Council Office on Promoting the Development of Personal Pension Funds", the financial products that can be invested in by personal pension fund accounts include bank wealth management, savings deposits, commercial pension insurance, and public mutual funds.
The first batch of personal pension wealth management products has been launched, marking that personal pension investors can officially purchase wealth management products through their personal pension fund accounts.
In November last year, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission formulated the "Interim Measures for the Management of Personal Pension Business of Commercial Banks and Wealth Management Companies".
The "Regulations" stipulate that participants can purchase personal pension savings, personal pension wealth management products, personal pension insurance products, personal pension public fund products, and other personal pension products through their personal pension fund accounts.
Subsequently, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the Ministry of Finance, and the State Taxation Administration issued a notice, clarifying that the individual pension system will be implemented in Beijing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang in Hebei, Xiong'an New District, Jincheng in Shanxi, and 36 other pilot cities and regions.
By the end of 2022, the number of participants in the personal pension fund was 19.54 million, with 6.13 million contributors, and the total contribution amount was 142 billion yuan.
Previously, the banks involved in the pilot program only launched three types of products: personal retirement savings, personal pension insurance products, and public mutual funds for personal pensions.
Now that various personal pension financial products are available, how should investors choose?
Experts from the BOCOM Wealth Management Product Development Department stated that compared to other personal pension products, both the pilot phase pension wealth management products and personal pension wealth management products have three distinct features.
One is stability, the risk management mechanism is more robust, the investment strategy and philosophy are more stable, and independent third-party custody is implemented outside of the parent bank.
Secondly, there is a long-term nature. During the pilot phase, the term of pension financial products is 5 years or more. The personal pension financial products to be issued in the next step have a minimum holding period of 1 year in principle, and holding for more than 3 years is encouraged.
Thirdly, it is inclusive, with a low threshold for product purchase. The starting point for purchase is generally 1 yuan, some are as low as 0.01 yuan, and the rates for product custody fees, management fees, and other fees are more favorable.
Professionals point out that investors should make choices based on the characteristics of the product and their own risk tolerance.
Personal pension savings have the characteristics of a long term, high interest rate, and high security, suitable for people with low risk tolerance. Personal pension insurance products focus on protection, and are more suitable for those who cannot bear investment risks and can accept stable returns. On the other hand, personal pension financial products and public mutual fund products do not guarantee principal or returns, carry certain investment risks, but have higher expected returns. They are suitable for people with certain financial knowledge and higher risk tolerance.

The fitness industry should overcome the trust crisis - China News Network
Another large gym "goes bust"?
Recently, the issue of member rights protection at the well-known fitness organization, Zhongjian Fitness, has attracted social attention.
After the Spring Festival, many members found that their respective stores were not operating normally. Subsequently, rumors about the organization's bankruptcy and absconding caused panic among the members, leading to the intervention of public security and human resources departments.
Finally, the person in charge of the institution responded, promising to strive to protect the legitimate rights and interests of employees and members, thus calming the storm.
Some individual fitness organizations have encountered operational issues at certain branches, leading to temporary closures. Consumers could have calmly waited for the problem to be resolved, so why is the first reaction of many members "this is a big problem"?
Behind the controversy over gym club membership rights protection, there is a deeper issue of trust crisis in the industry.
Domestic traditional gyms generally adopt a prepayment model, and "earning money from absent users" is the underlying logic of their development.
By obtaining cash flow through pre-selling membership cards and continuously opening new stores, it seems like a cycle can be repeated. However, in reality, it's like robbing Peter to pay Paul, unable to form a stable profit model.
Negative news about industries such as gyms closing down frequently emerges, strongly impacting consumer confidence.
Looking at the market prospects, a gym can certainly be considered a good business with a "money-making" future.
Although the fitness industry has its ups and downs, it always attracts capital attention.
Multiple data show that the popularity in areas such as cultural and sports consumption continues to rise, and the market is steadily recovering.
Specifically in the fitness market, as the living standards of residents steadily improve and the concept of healthy living deeply ingrains in people's minds, there is great potential for the development of the fitness industry.
The better the situation becomes, the more the industry needs to focus on the quality of development.
However, some organizations are blindly optimistic about the fitness market after the consumer recovery. Having just emerged from the crisis, they are sounding the horn to expand their territory, pouring all their financing funds into the construction of new stores.
It is undeniable that in recent years, due to the impact of the pandemic, many institutions have withdrawn, and the industry has reshuffled. Strong companies are selectively increasing their acquisition efforts and repositioning, which may well be a new opportunity.
However, if the fitness market wants to enter a virtuous cycle and embark on a path of steady and long-term development, the industry must change its traditional model and business strategy.
Only by being steady and reliable, and re-establishing consumer trust and a sense of security, can we truly win the market and the future.
Compared to aggressively opening new stores to capture the market, what the fitness industry currently needs more is to calm down and optimize services, using high-quality development to retain users.
Firstly, we need to retain users through service.
Gyms belong to the service industry, and their essence is to adhere to a "user-oriented" approach. They need to focus closely on user needs and place their operational focus on improving and upgrading their services.
Next, we need to enhance user experience through digital transformation.
For example, the currently popular internet gym model allows users to pay per use and choose their own location.
At the same time, physical data and exercise data can be effectively utilized, and can also meet social needs, achieving a complete service loop from online to offline.
Without personal trainers pushing sales, and without huge annual membership fees, users' worries about fitness organizations "running away" have decreased, and their sense of trust has also increased.
Additionally, we should actively explore diverse business formats.
Nowadays, sports consumption has shifted from a single service to scenario-based consumption. Fitness clubs are expected to become a new entry point for consumption. Peripheral products such as sports supplements and fitness equipment needed for fitness may become new profit points, providing consumers with more diverse choices.

Buy at a higher price, refund the difference!
"Nanjing Property Market Sees a Resurgence of 'Price Difference Compensation' - China News Network"
Yangzi Evening News (Reporter Ma Zuobo) reported on the 10th that during an interview, the Yangzi Evening News/Zi Niu News reporter discovered that the "price protection agreement", which has not been seen for more than a decade, has returned to the Nanjing real estate market. A property development located in the Jiangbei New District claims "compensation for price difference". If the discounts on other properties are greater than previous ones before the handover, the developer is willing to change the house for the buyer and refund the difference.
There are quite a few conditions in the "price protection agreement".
The property, named Poly Yangzi Cuiyuntai, is located in the Jiangbei New District. A prospective buyer, Mr. Sun, told reporters that he found a "statement" while visiting the property last weekend.
The picture he sent to the reporter shows that the developer of the property promises that anyone who purchases a property between February 1 and February 28, from the date of signing the purchase and sale contract to the delivery of the corresponding property, if the discount on other properties in the project is greater than the discount previously enjoyed by the buyer (limited to other unsold properties of the same type, same building, same unit, and same property type), the developer can exchange the property for the buyer and refund the difference.
Mr. Sun stated that the property consultant said this is actually a "price protection agreement", the purpose of which is to reassure buyers to make a purchase without worrying about the developer lowering the price for promotions. "Now the fear is that the price will drop after the purchase. There's no time to make a fuss at the sales office, and it's indeed frustrating if you don't," he said.
Moreover, quite a few homebuyers believe that although the "price guarantee agreement" is like a reassurance pill for homebuyers, the conditions are not low.
Ms. Zheng, who plans to buy a necessary house in Jiangbei, said that the price-protected properties must first be of the same type, and also in the same building and unit. There are very few properties that buyers can compare prices with, so the "threshold" is quite high.
Some homebuyers believe that due to information asymmetry, it is not ruled out that additional concessions may be given during sales, and it is not easy for buyers to "protect their rights".
Whether homebuyers can be retained remains to be seen.
The reporter learned from the Nanjing online real estate platform that the property development launched the sale of a total of 252 units in two buildings last November. The unit sizes include 105 square meters, 114 square meters, and 129 square meters, etc. The average selling price for fully furnished units is 39,843 yuan per square meter.
However, more than two months have passed, and the online real estate shows that the total number of unsold units in this property is 157, accounting for 62.3% of the total. Among them, there are 128 units in Building 8, with 113 unsold units. Out of 124 units in Building 7, 44 units are unsold. The total number of transactions for the project is only 33 units, accounting for just 13%.
Market insiders revealed that the "price protection agreement" also appeared in Nanjing in 2008.
In August of that year, the real estate project Hengtang West Garden on Huangshan Road in Hexi launched a "Price Protection Plan" to attract potential buyers. The specific content of the plan was "The company solemnly promises that if the discount range of the project expands within a year, the company will refund the difference to the original property owners."
Afterwards, in April 2011, nine real estate projects in Nanjing also offered a portion of their properties with a "price difference compensation" promise.
"The real estate market is recovering, and at this time, it needs a 'stimulant' even more."
Mr. Shen, a veteran operator in the Nanjing real estate industry, stated that "price maintenance agreements" are also one of the marketing strategies of real estate companies.
He believes that nowadays, property developers need confidence more than homebuyers, and the introduction of the "price guarantee agreement" is actually a way to boost their morale.
As for whether homebuyers can be retained, he said it depends on the impact of multiple factors such as regulatory policies and loan thresholds, which still remains to be observed at present.
Multiple Data Decline, Taiwan's Economy Starts the Year Poorly - China News Network
Xinhua News Agency, Taipei, February 11th (Reporters Zhao Bo, Huang Yang) - The export trade volume has experienced "five consecutive months of decline", the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the manufacturing sector has contracted for seven consecutive months, and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has once again seen a "three-digit figure"... Recently, the Taiwan authorities have successively released economic data for January 2023.
Experts analyze and believe that Taiwan's economic performance at the beginning of the year was not satisfactory, and the pressure for growth is considerable.
According to the financial affairs authority in Taiwan, the region's exports in January this year amounted to 31.51 billion US dollars, a year-on-year decrease of 21.2%, marking the fifth consecutive month of negative growth.
The export value of 11 major categories of export goods has declined compared to the same period last year.
The decline in plastic, rubber and their products, and optical equipment was the most significant, with annual decreases of 37.6% and 35.7% respectively.
Exports of electronic components decreased by 20.1% annually, marking the largest decline in 11 years.
Among them, the integrated circuit decreased by 18.3% annually, marking the largest decline in 14 years.
The head of the department's statistics division, Cai Meina, stated that this shows the spreading effect of weak demand in the consumer electronics industry, indicating that the electronics industry has entered a correction period.
Statistics show that in January, both imports and exports in the Taiwan region decreased, with a trade surplus of only 2.34 billion US dollars, the lowest level in nearly three years.
The financial affairs authority in Taiwan believes that due to a decrease in global terminal demand and industry inventory adjustments curbing manufacturers' willingness to purchase materials, the slump in exports is unlikely to improve in the short term. Taiwan's export decline in the first quarter of this year may be higher than expected.
According to the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for Taiwan's manufacturing sector, after seasonal adjustment, was 40.4% in January this year, a continuous decline of 3.3 percentage points from December last year, marking a contraction for seven consecutive months.
In the economic monitoring indicator system, PMI uses 50% as the boom-bust line. An index greater than 50% represents economic expansion, while less than 50% indicates contraction.
In January, among the five components of Taiwan's PMI, new orders, production, and employment contracted, supplier delivery times decreased, and inventory tightened.
All six major industries reported a contraction in PMI, ranked by the rate of contraction as follows: power and machinery equipment industry (35.1%), electronics and optics industry (35.2%), chemical and biotech medical industry (39.2%), basic raw materials industry (42.4%), transportation equipment industry (42.6%), and food and textile industry (45.7%).
In terms of prices, the "Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics" of the Taiwan authorities announced that the annual CPI growth rate in Taiwan in January this year was 3.04%, breaking through 3% again since July last year.
Among them, the price of vegetables soared by 28.25%, hitting a 17-month high.
Cao Zhihong, a special commissioner of Taiwan's "Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics," admitted that the increase in vegetable prices has indeed exceeded expectations. Excluding the Spring Festival factor, the average CPI in January and February this year should be close to 2.71% in December last year. There is still inflationary pressure, and it remains high.
Looking at Taiwan's economy this year, according to comprehensive reports from domestic media such as the "United Daily News" and "Yahoo Finance", experts express pessimism.
Professor Wu Daren from the Department of Economics at Taiwan's "Central University" analyzed that a decline in exports could cause cash flow problems for export manufacturing companies, leading to an increased risk of debt default.
At the same time, a decrease in orders leads manufacturers to cut labor costs, affecting the labor market and household economy, which in turn impacts consumer purchasing power.
Taiwan Institute of Economic Research scholar Qiu Dasheng believes that with the unresolved inflation situation in Europe and America this year and the continuous shrinkage of demand, it is estimated that Taiwan's export recession will continue into the first half of the year.
Due to Taiwan's economy being supported by exports, the economic growth for the whole year will not be as good as last year due to the impact of sluggish exports.
"Important Engine of Global Recovery" - China News Network
"In response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese economy has demonstrated strong resilience."
Recent market expectations indicate that the international community is generally optimistic about China's future development.
"Julio Rios, a renowned Spanish expert on China and honorary advisor to the China Policy Watch Network, said in a recent interview with our reporter that China's epidemic prevention and control has entered a new stage, and the vitality of economic and social development will be further unleashed."
Rios stated that in the face of various unexpected factors, China has calmly responded with extraordinary economic governance experience and measures, fully demonstrating its economic resilience and management level.
While China is steadfast in expanding its openness to the outside world, the endogenous driving force of economic development is constantly strengthening, with state-owned enterprises and private enterprises developing in synergy.
Every year, the two sessions of the National People's Congress of China are held, where representatives and members discuss major national development plans and hot issues related to people's livelihood. They widely gather consensus, unite people's hearts, and pool wisdom, adding strength to China's development.
"Since the reform and opening up, China has achieved long-term high-speed development and has now entered the stage of high-quality development.
The international community looks forward to Chinese wisdom and solutions, and anticipates that China's development will bring new opportunities to the world.
"Rios said that China is currently fully promoting technological innovation, injecting new vitality into economic and social development. "Investment, talent cultivation, policy incentives, these make China continue to be full of vitality in the new five-year plan," he said.
In Rios' view, economic system reform is a daunting task for any country.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, China not only leverages the strengths of the market economy, but also capitalizes on the superiority of the socialist system, taking proactive measures to stabilize the economy.
Focusing on the strategic pivot of expanding domestic demand, increasing financial support for the real economy, supporting private enterprises, small and medium-sized enterprises, and the development of the manufacturing industry, insisting on innovative development, promoting employment, improving the income and living standards of the Chinese people, and meeting the diverse and multi-level consumption needs of the people... China fully, accurately, and comprehensively implements the new development concept, strives to promote high-quality development, and builds a new development pattern, which will bring more growth opportunities to the world.
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the proposal of the "Belt and Road" Initiative.
"Stabilizing and reviving the economy after the pandemic is a common goal of the international community."
The continuous release of China's economic development potential will bring more benefits to countries around the world, becoming an important engine for global recovery.
Rios stated that he looks forward to the continued role of the "Belt and Road" cooperation in improving the infrastructure levels of various countries, strengthening interconnectivity in all fields, and continuing to unleash greater potential.

Save half or even more on costs?
Henan Province standardizes and integrates oral implant medical service prices - China News Network
CCTV News: Dental implants are the ideal choice for many patients with missing teeth, but the cost, often upwards of ten thousand yuan per tooth, deters many patients.
Since this year, with the accelerated implementation of dental implant bulk procurement, various places have also put the price reduction of dental implants on the agenda.
Starting from February 10th, the target for the full process price control of a single conventional dental implant medical service in Henan Province is 4300 yuan, and the full process cost of a single conventional implant should not exceed 97% of the price control target.
Dental implantation refers to a method of tooth restoration that uses an underlying structure implanted in the bone tissue to support and stabilize the upper dental prosthesis.
The reporter learned from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University that, taking a single conventional implant as an example, the price from implantation to final restoration is approximately around 16,000 to 17,000 yuan.
Patient He Ying: After the new policy, the doctor told me that in cases like mine, it would cost about 8,000 yuan, less than 10,000 yuan, basically saving half.
On the basis of the current project, Henan Province has also integrated and determined 15 oral implantation medical service price items such as "plant implantation fee (per piece)", and uniformly formulated the price and medical insurance payment category of provincial public medical institutions. It has also cancelled or adjusted 20 medical service price items such as dental implant surgery.
Li Yunjie, Director of the Pharmaceutical Pricing and Tendering Procurement Department of Zhengzhou Medical Security Bureau: The main beneficiaries are four parties. One is medical insurance, which has reduced its expenditure; hospitals have less pressure, and the number of patients may increase appropriately; for suppliers, they have gained a market; for us patients, we are the biggest beneficiaries, as the cost of implanting a tooth may be halved or even more.

The Chinese e-commerce industry is experiencing "new variables", how can product promotion achieve "content is king"?
- China News Service
China News Service, February 11th - Title: With the emergence of "new variables" in China's e-commerce industry, how can product promotion achieve "content is king"?
China News Finance Reporter Xia Bin
"We entered the e-commerce industry relatively late, but from the very beginning, we realized that in order to stand out from the countless shops, content is very important.
Fangfang, a post-90s girl from Guangdong, is currently operating a nourishing food ingredient shop on Douyin e-commerce, making a brick-and-mortar store with a history of over 30 years "blossom" online.
Imitating the style of old Hong Kong films and accompanied by classic Cantonese songs, opening @FangFang's Douyin account offers a refreshing experience with its exquisite videos.
At the recent Douyin E-commerce "Finding Companions·High-quality Content Sharing Session", Fangfang, as a representative of high-quality creators, attended and spoke, sharing her daily creative experiences and insights.
She said at the scene, "The carefully polished videos have attracted a lot of attention from netizens. Many people are interested in the ingredients in my home and want to cook delicious food together, which has suddenly opened up a market."
You didn't provide any Chinese text. Please provide the text you want to be translated.
Fangfang has attracted more people to fall in love with the "taste of old Guangzhou" through her soup-making videos. In one live broadcast, she sold up to 300,000 pieces of nourishing ingredients, saving her family's nearly bankrupt old store.
"No content, no e-commerce." With the continuous development of short videos and live-streaming e-commerce, people's requirements and standards for e-commerce content are entering a new stage.
In the early stages of live-streaming sales development, live-streaming rooms often used low-price discounts to attract users, and price advantage seemed to be the only selling point at that time.
In recent years, there have been phenomenon-level influencers such as Liu Genghong and Dongfang Zhenxuan, as well as many experts and merchants in niche fields that are not well-known to the general public. They have been enhancing their long-term business benefits by continuously creating high-quality content that aligns with their brand tone.
Gao Yaxuan, the person in charge of operations for star authors in Douyin E-commerce, explained that in the past year, 6.27 million creators have monetized their content through Douyin E-commerce. Their content creation volume has increased by 252%, and the total transaction amount has more than doubled.
"Behind these numbers, we can feel a thriving and vibrant author ecosystem."
"Gao Yaxuan said.
Beijing Normal University's Communication Innovation and Future Media Experimental Platform previously released the "E-commerce Industry Content Ecology Health Index (ECHI) Report", which analyzed the importance of the "new variable" - quality content in the current e-commerce industry from a data perspective. The index was used to evaluate the content ecology of 27 mainstream e-commerce platforms in China.
According to the e-commerce industry content ecosystem health index ranking in the aforementioned report, Douyin E-commerce, Kuaishou, Taobao, Pinduoduo, and JD.com are in the top five.
The report suggests that the content ecosystem in the e-commerce industry is a comprehensive concept, integrating e-commerce with content. However, not all content can be integrated with e-commerce. Good PGC (Professionally Generated Content) and UGC (User Generated Content) are the high-quality carriers for integration with e-commerce. The higher the value of the content platform, the richer the scenarios for consumption and promotion, the higher the possibility of e-commerce integration, and the stronger the commercial value. The proportion of e-commerce content production and content consumption in this gradually integrated distribution of public and private domains will also be higher.
On the scene, Professor Yu Guoming from the School of Journalism and Communication at Beijing Normal University, who is also the Chairman of the China Media Economics and Management Committee, provided an analysis and interpretation of the report.
He stated that in terms of content value, the current e-commerce industry has transitioned from "consumer accessibility" to the "consumer quality" stage. High-quality, professional, and differentiated content is the "hard currency" of the e-commerce industry.
At the same time, content has become the foundation and key focus of the new stage of e-commerce development. Paid knowledge, professional knowledge, and KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders) and other PGC (Professionally Generated Content) have started to become standard features in e-commerce live streams.
Looking towards the future development of the e-commerce industry, Yu Guoming proposed two suggestions.
One perspective is to enhance from the aspect of content structure, promoting the overall improvement of the health and quality of e-commerce content ecology, establishing positive content creation and management standards, and achieving a dynamic balance of the health system index of the e-commerce industry content ecology.
Another perspective is from the external ecology, to achieve the healthy development of the content e-commerce industry and the value synergy and co-creation with the external environment.
"The future of the e-commerce industry still requires more data and support in the field of artificial intelligence to form predictions for future development stability. In addition, it is necessary to provide merchants with a more standardized and healthy growth space, realize the value synergy of enterprises, users, products and services in the e-commerce industry, and jointly create a healthy content ecosystem."

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 11th - Title: Promoting Chinese-style modernization is a systematic project - A deep understanding of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the opening ceremony of the study seminar on the spirit of the 20th Party Congress.
Xinhua News Agency Commentator
"Promoting modernization with Chinese characteristics is a systematic project, which requires comprehensive planning, systematic design, and overall advancement. It is necessary to properly handle a series of major relationships, such as top-level design and practical exploration, strategy and tactics, adherence to principles and innovation, efficiency and fairness, vitality and order, self-reliance and openness to the outside world."
"At the opening ceremony of the seminar for the newly elected members and alternate members of the Central Committee and the main leaders of the provincial and ministerial levels to study and implement Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era and the spirit of the 20th Party Congress, General Secretary Xi Jinping scientifically grasped the laws of modernization construction, deeply and systematically clarified a series of major relationships that need to be handled well in practice, providing us with a scientific methodology to vigorously promote modernization in the Chinese style."
Promoting Chinese-style modernization involves various fields such as economy, politics, culture, society, and ecological civilization. It relates to all aspects of governing the party, the country, and the military, as well as domestic and foreign affairs and national defense. It requires both systematic planning and the courage to reform and innovate, continuously achieving overall progress.
To carry out top-level design, it is necessary to deeply understand the major trends of world development, accurately grasp the common aspirations of the people, and deeply explore the laws of economic and social development. The formulated plans and policy systems should reflect the characteristics of the times, grasp the regularity, and be rich in creativity, achieving a combination of long-term and short-term perspectives, top-down coherence, and content coordination.
Promoting modernization in the Chinese style is an exploratory endeavor, with many unknown areas still to be discovered. It requires bold exploration in practice and promoting development through reform and innovation. We must never be rigid in our approach or wait for opportunities to fall into our lap.
Strategic issues are fundamental issues for a political party or a country.
To promote modernization with Chinese characteristics, we need to enhance the foresight of our strategy, using scientific strategic foresight to predict and lead the future. We need to enhance the overall nature of our strategy, focusing on solving major issues that affect the rise and fall of the Party and the country's cause, and that have far-reaching implications. We need to enhance the stability of our strategy. Once a strategy is formed, it must be adhered to for a long time, pursued to the end, and well executed.
To scientifically grasp the dialectical unity of strategy and tactics, we must organically combine the principled nature of strategy and the flexibility of tactics, be flexible and adaptable, make decisions on the spot, and take the initiative in strategy by adapting to local conditions, acting according to circumstances, and going with the flow.
The Chinese nation is a nation that upholds righteousness and fosters innovation.
Balancing the relationship between upholding tradition and promoting innovation is crucial. We must steadfastly adhere to the essence, roots, and spirit of Chinese-style modernization, unwaveringly uphold its Chinese characteristics, essential requirements, and major principles, and ensure the correct direction of Chinese-style modernization. At the same time, we must place innovation at the forefront of national development, conform to the requirements of the times, focus on solving major theoretical and practical problems, actively adapt to changes, vigorously promote reform and innovation, continuously create new momentum and advantages for development, and fully stimulate the creative vitality of the whole society.
Efficiency is the important foundation of fairness, and fairness is a strong guarantee of efficiency.
We are promoting modernization with Chinese characteristics, aiming not only to create efficiency higher than that of capitalism, but also to more effectively maintain social fairness, and better achieve a balance, mutual promotion, and unity between efficiency and fairness.
Manage the relationship between efficiency and fairness well, continuously realize development for the people, development depends on the people, and the results of development are shared by the people. Let the results of modernization construction benefit all people more and more fairly.
To promote modernization with Chinese characteristics, it is necessary to balance vitality and order, ensuring society is both vibrant and stable.
We must coordinate the two major tasks of development and security, implement the overall national security concept, improve the national security system, enhance the ability to maintain national security, and firmly safeguard the security of national political power, system, ideology, and key areas.
While considering safety factors more in development, we enhance national security strength through development, and use the results of development to solidify the foundation of national security. We are also good at creating a safe environment conducive to economic and social development, constantly stimulating development vitality, and achieving a positive interaction between high-quality development and high-level security.
To promote modernization with Chinese characteristics, we must both persist in our own path and broaden our global perspective, adhere to opening up to the world, and continuously expand the breadth and depth of modernization with Chinese characteristics.
We must adhere to independence and self-reliance, insist on basing the development of our country and nation on our own strength, and firmly hold the fate of our country's development and progress in our own hands.
We must continuously expand high-level openness to the outside world, deeply participate in global industrial division and cooperation, make good use of both domestic and international resources, expand the development space of Chinese-style modernization, and share development opportunities and create a better future in a mutually beneficial and win-win situation.
Only by following the path can one go far.
Under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, and guided by the scientific principles of Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, let us grasp the laws, be diligent and unrelenting, fully exert our enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity, properly handle a series of major relationships, strive to make progress on the new journey of fully building a modern socialist country, and continuously explore new frontiers of modernization with Chinese characteristics.
(Voice of Germany Chinese Network) The Biden administration will blacklist six Chinese entities suspected of involvement in a spy balloon program this Friday (February 10th).
The U.S. Department of Commerce stated that these five Chinese companies and one research institution are aiding the modernization of the Chinese military, particularly in aerospace projects, including airships and aircraft.
Companies on the blacklist find it difficult to obtain technology exports from the United States.
The list is referred to as the "Entity List". Companies on this list will not be able to purchase technology or goods from U.S. suppliers unless they obtain a special export license from the U.S. Department of Commerce.
The companies on the blacklist are: Beijing Nanjiang Aerospace Technology Co., Ltd., China Electronics Technology Group's 48th Research Institute, Dongguan Lingkong Remote Sensing Technology Co., Ltd., Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd., Guangzhou Tianhaixiang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd., and Shanxi Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd.
Before this, the White House indicated that it was considering taking broader measures to "expose and deal with" larger-scale surveillance activities by China that threaten U.S. national security.
The balloon incident has further escalated tensions between China and the United States, leading US Secretary of State Blinken to cancel his trip to China.
On February 4, the United States shot down a balloon, leading the Chinese government to lodge a formal protest with the U.S. embassy in China, criticizing the U.S. for seriously undermining and damaging the efforts and progress made in stabilizing Sino-U.S. relations.
Based on the existing wreckage evidence and information from China's military procurement platform, the U.S. government has concluded that the manufacturer of the balloon "has a direct relationship with the Chinese People's Liberation Army," and is a supplier approved by the Chinese military.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning stated at a press conference on Friday that regarding the accidental incident of a Chinese unmanned civilian airship inadvertently entering US airspace due to force majeure, China has repeatedly explained the situation and clarified its position.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, she further stated that the relevant resolutions of the U.S. Congress are purely political manipulation and hype.
China strongly disapproves and firmly opposes this.
Matthew Axelrod, the Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Department of Commerce responsible for export enforcement, stated: "Today's actions demonstrate our joint efforts to identify and prevent China's use of spy balloons, which have violated the airspace of the United States and over 40 other countries.
You didn't provide any Chinese text. Please provide the text you want to be translated.
Reuters reports that an employee of Guangzhou Tianhaixiang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd. claimed to be unaware of the sanctions and refused to comment further.
The Chinese Embassy in the United States has not yet commented on this information.

(Deutsche Welle Chinese) Several days have passed since the earthquake occurred in parts of Turkey and Syria, and the hope of finding survivors is gradually fading. However, the rescue of a family of five on Saturday brought immense relief to the rescue workers.
According to the Associated Press, a family of five was successfully rescued after being trapped under rubble for more than five days in Nurdağı, a heavily affected area in the province of Gaziantep.
Rescue workers first pulled the mother and daughter from a pile of rubble, then found the father, but he insisted on rescuing his son and another daughter first.
After they were all rescued, cheers erupted from the crowd.
In the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, under severe cold weather conditions, a 16-year-old boy and a 70-year-old woman were successfully rescued.
"What day is it today?"
"——The young man who was trapped under the rubble for 129 hours asked the rescuer who saved him after he was brought back to the surface.
A man from Kahramanmaras is holding his cat that was just rescued.
The miraculous success of the rescue operation brought a glimmer of hope to the originally bleak search and rescue efforts. However, at the same time, the number of victims continues to rise.
According to official statistics, the earthquake on Monday has already caused over 20,000 deaths in Turkey, and the estimated death toll in neighboring Syria is over 3,500.
Despite experts stating that a person can survive for more than a week after being trapped in ruins, the hope of finding more survivors has become increasingly slim.
Rescue personnel are still using thermal imaging devices to search for signs of life under the rubble.
Meanwhile, the focus of the rescue work began to shift towards helping those survivors who were in urgent need of assistance.
United Nations Official: The region faces a "once-in-a-century" disaster
United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Martin Griffiths, stated at a press conference in Turkey that this earthquake is the "worst disaster in the region in a century".
He also praised Turkey's response to the disaster as "extraordinary."
He also told Reuters reporters that he hopes to provide aid to areas controlled by the Syrian government and the opposition, but also stated that the related matters are "still unclear".
The United Nations has pledged an additional $25 million in relief donations to the earthquake-stricken areas of Syria.
Earlier this week, the United Nations announced a grant of 25 million dollars for disaster relief in Turkey and Syria.

On this day, the largest earthquake in North American history occurred in Alaska, USA, reaching a magnitude of 9.2.
Until 2006, the Alaskan earthquake was still the third largest earthquake ever recorded in the world.
When the earthquake occurred, a fault between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate broke near the place where Prince William Sound meets College Fjord.
In most areas, the earthquake lasted from 3 to 5 minutes.
The displacement of the seabed triggered a massive tsunami with a height of 67 meters.
Since it was a holiday that day, both schools and many businesses were closed.
This major earthquake ultimately resulted in the death of 139 people.
Among them, 9 people died directly from the earthquake, while the other 130 people died from the tsunami triggered by the earthquake.

A total of 14 countries along the Pacific coast were affected, with the most severely affected areas including Aceh Province in Indonesia, Hua Hin and Phuket resort areas in Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Tamil Nadu in India.
At the time, it was the peak tourist season of Christmas, and the disaster-stricken area was crowded with a large number of tourists and local residents. This led to many tourists enjoying their holidays on the beach and locals working by the sea being swept away by the tsunami. As a result, many people went missing due to this earthquake.
It is estimated that the number of casualties and missing persons is at least 300,000.
The most destructive earthquake globally in the past 60 years

The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant experienced a leakage accident due to the impact of an earthquake and tsunami.
This accident was classified as the most severe level 7 on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES).
The Fukushima nuclear accident resulted in trace amounts of radioactive substances being measured worldwide, including Iodine-131 and Cesium-137 (with a half-life of 30 years).
A large amount of radioactive isotopes were released into the Pacific Ocean due to this nuclear accident.
According to United Nations statistics, at least 870,000 people in the disaster areas of Turkey and Syria are in urgent need of food.
In Syria alone, as many as 5.3 million people have lost their homes due to earthquakes.
The World Food Programme (WFP) has called for a donation of 77 million US dollars to provide food for the disaster-stricken people in Turkey and Syria who have been displaced due to earthquakes.
Currently, the temperature in the disaster area has dropped below zero, and many disaster victims have no place to live.
The Turkish government has distributed a large number of hot meals, tents, and blankets, but these supplies are still difficult to reach many people who urgently need help.
In Syria, which has been mired in a civil war for as long as 12 years, the earthquake has added to the suffering of the people, making a bad situation even worse.
Within four days after the earthquake, the World Food Programme has provided food aid to 115,000 people in Turkey and Syria.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has sent 72 tons of medical supplies for trauma treatment and emergency surgeries.

This year marks the 60th anniversary of the dispatch of Chinese medical aid teams abroad. I would like to extend my sincere condolences to the comrades who are currently and have previously carried out medical aid missions abroad.
Xi Jinping pointed out that the Chinese people love peace and cherish life, and providing medical aid abroad is a vivid manifestation of this.
I hope that you will not forget your original intention, keep your mission in mind, and vigorously promote the spirit of the Chinese medical team, which is not afraid of hardship, willing to dedicate, save the dying, help the injured, and love without borders. Use benevolent heart and skills to benefit the local people, tell the Chinese story through practical actions, and make greater contributions to the promotion of building a common health community for mankind.

Cai Qi, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Secretary of the Central Secretariat, attended the graduation ceremony and delivered a concluding speech.
He stated that it is necessary to deeply study and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the opening ceremony of the seminar, to more firmly support the "two establishments", resolutely achieve the "two maintenances", enhance capabilities, and truly work hard. He emphasized the need to solidly promote various tasks of modernization in the Chinese style, and to create achievements in the comprehensive construction of a socialist modern country and the comprehensive promotion of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation that can withstand the tests of history, practice, and the people.

At the graduation ceremony, 10 representatives from the seminar spoke, sharing their learning achievements.
Cai Qi stated that studying and implementing Xi Jinping's thoughts on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era and the spirit of the 20th Party Congress is not only the primary political task for the current and future periods, but also a long-term strategic task. We need to follow the requirements of "comprehensive learning, comprehensive understanding, and comprehensive implementation", and continuously deepen, actualize, and internalize the study and implementation work.
To deeply comprehend the decisive significance of the "two establishments", we must resolutely uphold the core position of General Secretary Xi Jinping, defend the authority and centralized unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, continuously improve political judgment, political comprehension, and political execution, and always maintain a high degree of consistency in thought, politics, and action with the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core.
We must strive to master the theoretical skills of Marxism, consciously arm our minds with the innovative theories of the Party, guide practice, and promote work. We should put effort into deep learning, careful understanding, and steadfast practice, truly learning to develop firm beliefs, absolute loyalty, and a sense of mission.
We must implement the decisions and plans of the Party's 20th Congress with a spirited and proactive attitude, solidly promote modernization with Chinese characteristics, roll up our sleeves and work hard, throw ourselves into the role of "construction team leader", and turn the blueprint into reality step by step.
We must always remember that the comprehensive and strict governance of the party is always on the road, and the self-revolution of the party is always on the road. We must tighten and solidify the political responsibility of the comprehensive and strict governance of the party, take the political construction of the party as the guide, and deeply promote the new great project of the party's construction in the new era.
To enhance the ability to promote high-quality development, serve the public, and prevent and resolve risks, we must vigorously promote the spirit of investigation and research, and resolutely prevent and overcome formalism and bureaucracy.
Shi Taifeng, Li Ganjie, Li Shulei, Chen Wenqing, Liu Jinguo, and Wang Xiaohong attended the graduation ceremony, with Chen Xi presiding over the ceremony.
Google AI chatbot "answers question incorrectly", parent company's stock value evaporates by hundreds of billions of dollars
(Comprehensive report from the 11th)
Google's newly launched artificial intelligence chatbot, Bard, got off to a rocky start, "answering questions incorrectly" in promotional videos, causing Alphabet, Google's parent company, to see a sharp 8.9% drop in its stock price on Wednesday, breaking the $100 mark. The company's market value evaporated by $110 billion (approximately 476.5 billion ringgit), closing at $94.57 on Friday.
The market is worried that Alphabet is not as competitive as its rival Microsoft.
According to Reuters, Google earlier posted a promotional video of its AI chatbot Bard on social media, in which someone asked Bard, "What new discoveries about the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) can I tell my 9-year-old child?"
"Bard mentioned in his response that the telescope had once captured the first photo of a planet outside our solar system."
However, according to data from the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the first photo of an exoplanet in the solar system was taken by the "Very Large Telescope" of the European Southern Observatory in 2004.
Reuters reported under the headline "Alphabet's stock price plummets after Bard's incorrect response".
On the other hand, Google pointed out that Bard's response "highlights the importance of rigorous testing processes," and will combine external feedback with its own internal testing to ensure that Bard's response "meets high standards in terms of quality, safety, and accurate information."

It is estimated that the total tourism revenue for 2022 can reach 13.8 to 14.3 billion Singapore dollars, a 6 to 7 times increase from the 1.89 billion Singapore dollars in 2021. This has already recovered to about 50% to 52% of the level before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019.
The Singapore government is taking multiple measures to accelerate the recovery of the tourism industry.
In April 2022, the government announced an allocation of nearly 500 million Singapore dollars to stimulate the recovery of the tourism industry.
The Tourism Bureau recently announced that it plans to allocate 110 million Singapore dollars from this budget over the next two years to introduce more commercial and leisure activities to attract tourists back.
In order to make health and wellness tourism one of the highlights of Singapore, the Singapore Tourism Board launched an intention solicitation event on November 23, 2022, planning to develop a health and wellness attraction on the southern coast of Singapore.
Wang Lingli, the Executive Director of Sports and Wellness Tourism at the Singapore Tourism Board, said that in recent years, more and more tourists are prioritizing their health above all other considerations.
Developing a health and wellness attraction in the Marina South area, which boasts the Marina Bay Gardens and the Marina Dam, is expected to contribute to Singapore's tourism industry and economy, encouraging tourists to spend and stay longer in Singapore.
The Director of the Singapore Tourism Board, Tan Kian Long, stated that in the coming years, health and wellness will become an important part of Singapore's tourism products.
The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened public awareness and demand for physical and mental health.
For this reason, the tourism bureau has been promoting health and wellness programs to the local public and international tourists for the past two years.
In June 2022, the Singapore Tourism Board held the inaugural Health and Wellness Festival, offering the public more than 130 different health activities and experiences.
Singapore will continue to provide new travel experiences for tourists.
In addition to the newly opened Singapore Children's Museum, the Avatar World at Gardens by the Bay, the Central Beach Market in Sentosa, the new "Exploring New Territories" exhibition hall at the Art Science Museum, and the newly built open-air theater at the Night Safari, the Tourism Board will support the development and renewal of projects such as the Aviary Park at the Wildlife World, making Singapore an attractive international travel destination.
According to the plan, Singapore will establish industry standards for the sustainable development of the conference, exhibition, and incentive tourism industry within 2023, with a focus on improving waste management and carbon emissions. This will further optimize the tourism environment.
The recovery of Singapore's tourism industry has accelerated the recovery of the aviation industry.
Data shows that as of December 18, 2022, passenger traffic at Changi Airport has strongly rebounded, with as many as 150,000 passengers received daily, and about 1 million passengers weekly. This is equivalent to approximately 75% of the level before the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of aviation industry employees on duty has also recovered to about 90% of the pre-pandemic level.
Data shows that from January to October 2022, Singapore has received 23.6 million visitors, equivalent to 42% of the number before the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of flights taking off and landing reached 170,000, which is 53% of the number before the pandemic.
The rapid recovery of the tourism industry has also driven the recovery pace of industries such as accommodation, transportation, catering, and shopping.
The Singapore government and tourism industry have high hopes for the Chinese market.
Assistant Director of the International Department of the Singapore Tourism Board, Ke Shudan, said that a survey by a Chinese travel platform shows that Singapore's safety index ranks among the top three globally. This is also one of the reasons why Singapore is deeply loved by Chinese tourists.
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 3.6 million people from China traveled to Singapore for vacation each year.
With China easing its border policies, it is expected that the number of Chinese tourists this year can recover to 30% to 60% of the 2019 level.
Ke Shudan pointed out that, moving forward, the Tourism Bureau will closely monitor signals from China regarding further relaxation of outbound travel policies, in order to respond to changes in tourist demand.
In addition to strengthening partnerships with Chinese online travel platforms and travel agencies such as Ctrip, the Singapore Tourism Board will actively prepare to welcome Chinese tourists in response to new trends in outbound travel from China.
Looking ahead to the tourism market in 2023, the Singapore Tourism Board is full of confidence, believing that as long as the global economy does not experience a significant recession affecting public income, and there are no new large-scale deadly epidemic outbreaks, the recovery of the tourism industry will be faster than expected.
Kim Jong-un interacts intimately with his daughter, leaving his wife neglected on the side.
(Comprehensive report on the 11th) On the evening of the 8th, North Korea held a military parade to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of its army. Kim Jong-un's daughter, Kim Ju-ae, not only attended, but also stood on the podium with her father.
North Korean state media released a video on the 9th, showing Kim's daughter affectionately nestled by her father's side, exchanging warm glances and whispers several times. She gently held her father's cheeks with both hands, even touching his chest. The footage of their father-daughter interaction was broadcasted nationwide.
However, the First Lady Li Xue Zhu could only step aside.
According to reports from South Korea's "Chosun News" and other sources, Kim Jong-un and his wife Ri Sol-ju, along with their daughter Kim Ju-ae, attended an official banquet on the 7th. In the official group photo, Kim Ju-ae was unusually seated in the center between her parents. The next evening, at the 75th anniversary parade of the founding of the army, she also ascended to the podium with Kim Jong-un.
The North Korean official media "Korean Central Television" released parade footage afterwards, revealing more scenes of deep father-daughter affection.
Kim Jong-un exchanged glances with his daughter several times on the podium, their smiles never fading. They also whispered to each other, with Kim's daughter at one point cupping her father's cheeks with both hands, to which Kim Jong-un responded with a radiant smile.
Other official media images also show that Kim Jo Ai, when sitting on an indoor sofa with Kim Jong Un, constantly touches her father's face with her hand; when she walks hand in hand with her father, she touches Kim Jong Un's chest with her hand.
And the First Lady, Li Xue, could only walk behind or sit aside throughout the whole process, always a few steps away from her husband and daughter.
South Korean media pointed out that since Kim Jong-un first appeared in public on November 18 last year when he tested the Mars-17 missile, his exposure rate has been increasing over the past three months. This is already his fifth appearance at an official event.
The North Korean official media referred to Kim Jong Un using extremely high honorifics such as "most beloved brother" and "noble brother". They also broadcasted clips of Kim Jong Un repeatedly shouting pledges of loyalty to the Baekdu bloodline while overlooking a military parade from the stands.
These signs have led outsiders to suspect whether Kim Jo Ai has already been designated as the successor to the Kim regime. The Washington Post analyzed that "this is a signal that Kim Jong Un is pushing his middle school-aged daughter to the position of successor." However, some believe that such a judgment is still premature. In the situation where Kim Jong Un has a son, all possibilities are still preserved.
Chongyang Q&A | How to View the US Non-farm Employment Data for January Exceeding Expectations and Future Trends - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website
Q: May I ask Chongyang Investment, how do you view the U.S. non-farm employment data for January greatly exceeding expectations and its future trend?
A: On February 3rd, the U.S. Department of Labor announced the non-farm employment data for January 2023, with an increase of 517,000 non-farm jobs, significantly higher than the market expectation of 189,000; the unemployment rate dropped to 3.4%, the lowest in nearly 50 years; the hourly wage increased by 4.4% year-on-year, and 0.3% month-on-month, showing a slight slowdown.
Looking at the overall volume, there are many one-time and technical factors disturbing this data, such as striking teachers returning to work, corrections to the scope of the survey statistics, and updates to the seasonal adjustment factors. Subsequent corrections may be made (refer to the January 2022 revision of the newly added non-farm employment from 504,000 to 364,000). Non-farm employment may not be as strong as the data suggests.
From a structural perspective, the impact of layoffs in high-tech companies is still present, but the proportion is relatively low. High-contact service industries such as leisure hotels, education, healthcare, etc., have seen a significant rebound in new employment, and data shows that there is still a labor gap in the service industry.
Combining the equally larger-than-expected service industry PMI, the rebound in job vacancies and labor shortage data, and the strength of consumer credit data, we judge that the U.S. service industry has undergone a rapid recovery after extreme weather and holidays.
We believe that without a recession, it is difficult to alleviate the tension between supply and demand in the U.S. job market.
Currently, there is still a supply gap of over 5 million in the US labor market, and the labor participation rate is rising slowly, especially the labor participation rate of 25-54 year olds, which is already close to the peak before the pandemic.
In addition, due to the strength of excess savings and consumer credit among U.S. residents, the strong consumer demand will cause the impact of austerity policies on the employment market to further lag behind.
The continuous tension in the US job market supply and demand will be the underlying tone of the US economy in 2023.
Given the current situation of the nearing end of interest rate hikes, and the constant fluctuations in inflation expectations, we are not optimistic about the continuous decline in wage growth rate.
Before the data was released, the U.S. stock, bond, and foreign exchange markets were overly optimistic about the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike path.
As inflation data continues to improve, the Federal Reserve is maintaining a delicate balance of fragile market inflation expectations while shortening the pace of rate hikes. However, the market is turning a blind eye to the Fed's hawkish rhetoric, not only expecting an early halt to rate hikes, but also anticipating two rate cuts by the end of the year.
In the context of a tense labor market supply and demand, and the unclear impact of tightening policies, we believe that the Federal Reserve's guidance on interest rate hikes at the end of the year is relatively reasonable. Adjustments to extreme market expectations and crowded trading could potentially cause some damage to the market.
Despite this, the stubbornness of wage growth is difficult to change the current trend of rapid decline in inflation. With the year-on-year M2 data turning negative and the gradual improvement of various CPI sub-item leading indicators, the US CPI data has been in a rapid decline stage since October. The stubbornness of wage growth will only form a bottom for future inflation data, and the current market expectations are difficult to falsify. After the next inflation data is released, the market may enter a new round of game.
Zheng Yonggang, founder of Shanshan, passed away due to a sudden heart disease. He once led the transformation of China's first clothing stock - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website.
Economic Observer reporter Zheng Yu Xin reported on February 11th that a WeChat public account, certified by Shanshan Holdings Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Shanshan Holdings"), announced the death of Zheng Yonggang, the founder of Shanshan Enterprises and chairman of the board of directors of Shanshan Holdings. He died of a sudden heart disease on February 10, 2023, at the age of 65, despite attempts to save him.
In the 1980s, Zheng Yonggang served as the director of a state-owned cotton spinning factory. With his reassignment, in 1989, Zheng Yonggang became the director of Ningbo Yungang Garment Factory, the predecessor of Shanshan Shares.
In December 2022, at the 20th China Business Leaders Annual Meeting and the 22nd China Future Stars of Business Annual Meeting, Zheng Yonggang stated in his speech that in the Chinese suit market of the 1990s, the market share of the Trands brand once reached as high as 37%.
In 1996, Shanshan Co. Ltd. (600884.SH) went public, becoming the first listed company in China's clothing industry.
Just when the clothing business was booming, the Shanshan Group began to transform, because Zheng Yonggang realized, "Once the market is liberalized, Chinese brands will naturally form a tiered brand market. The likelihood of Shanshan suits always leading the trend and becoming the national attire of the Chinese people for a long time is not great."
In 1999, Shanshan began to research corporate transformation. Zheng Yonggang recalled that year, "We came to Shanghai to figure out what exactly to do in the transformation. We specifically sought out many experts and scholars, continuously holding meetings like Zhuge Liang meetings and theoretical seminars."
Finally, we have set two major strategic directions.
The first direction is new energy and new materials, and the other is the promising future of public health.
After determining the strategic direction, Shanshan began to seek cooperation. At that time, the Anshan Thermal Energy Institute, which provided carbon research for Angang, was working on a national 863 project, but lacked sufficient research funding. Therefore, Shanshan signed a cooperation agreement with the Carbon Research Institute of the Anshan Thermal Energy Institute to jointly promote the industrialization of the national 863 project "Intermediate Phase Carbon Microsphere". They engaged in the research, production, and sales of negative electrode materials, and achieved the commercial promotion of negative electrode materials domestically.
In 2001, Shanshan Co., Ltd. achieved large-scale production of mesophase pitch microspheres, initiating domestic substitution and replacing Japan as the main supplier of mesophase pitch microspheres in China.
This is China's first lithium-ion battery anode material production company, achieving the domestic production of lithium-ion battery anode materials.
With the rapid popularization of lithium battery applications, the lithium battery business of Shanshan Co., Ltd. began to gradually develop. In 2007, the lithium battery material business was written into the main business of Shanshan Co., Ltd., and the proportion of revenue from the clothing business decreased year by year. Until 2013, the revenue from the lithium battery material business of Shanshan Co., Ltd. fully exceeded that of the clothing business.
In February 2021, Shanshan Co., Ltd. successfully acquired the polarizer business of LG Chem, entering the LCD polarizer market, and established the polarizer company Shanjing Optoelectronics. The technology in this field is relatively advanced, and Shanshan's main competitors are all Fortune 500 companies, such as Samsung from South Korea, Sumitomo Chemical from Japan, and Nitto Denko.
Zheng Yonggang once shared his insights on post-investment management, "Chinese private enterprises have a relatively low success rate in acquiring some high-tech companies internationally. Why do these acquisitions fail?
"Because everyone would consider, 'I've spent so much money, I should send someone to manage it, right?' This is a common behavior," However, Zheng Yonggang is different. On the day that Shanshan successfully acquired it, Zheng Yonggang publicly announced at Shanjing Optoelectronics that Shanshan, as the major shareholder of Shanjing, decided to implement a 'one enterprise, two systems' policy. Apart from Zheng Yonggang serving as the chairman, Shanshan's personnel would not be sent to Shanjing. Instead, they would adopt an authorized management approach, and the existing distribution system, corporate culture, and various management models would remain unchanged.
ICC Xinlu Information released negative pole data for 2022, showing that Sunsun's negative pole shipment volume broke through 200,000 tons in 2022, an increase of 100% year-on-year. The market share reached 16%, and the shipment volume of artificial graphite negative pole materials remained at the top.
In terms of polarizing film business, statistics from Yano Research show that the company's subsidiary, Shinkin Optoelectronics, has achieved a global market share of 29% in 2022. It is expected that the market share will reach 32% in 2023, continuing to rank first globally.
In the first three quarters of 2022, Shanshan Co., Ltd.'s revenue was 15.841 billion yuan, and the net profit was 2.313 billion yuan. On February 10, the share price of Shanshan Co., Ltd. was 19.24 yuan per share, with a total market value of 43.6 billion yuan.
On February 9, Shanshan Co., Ltd. stated on the interactive platform that by the end of 2022, the company's effective graphite production capacity is about 100,000 tons, and the graphite production capacity of the Meishan project is still ramping up.
According to Wind, Zheng Yonggang is currently still the chairman and actual controller of Shanshan Shares.
According to Tianyancha, Zheng Yonggang holds 40.1% of the total shares in Shanshan Holdings Limited.
The General Manager of Shanshan Shares is Li Zhihua, born in 1968. He has served as the Chairman of Dongguan Shanshan Battery Materials Co., Ltd., Ningbo Shanshan New Material Technology Co., Ltd., Hunan Shanshan Energy Technology Co., Ltd., and as the Deputy General Manager of Ningbo Shanshan Shares Co., Ltd.
On February 10, SanSan Co., Ltd. stated on the investor interaction platform that there is no kinship between the company's senior management and the actual controller of the company.
"Fund E-Account" is here: The Securities Regulatory Commission authorizes development, allowing investors to consolidate and query all funds under their name - Economic Observation Network - Professional Financial News Website.
Economic Observer Network reporter Chen Shan: Does the complexity of fund purchase channels make it difficult to collect account information?
Always forgetting the "petty cash"?
These issues of the base citizens are about to be resolved.
On February 10, the China Securities Regulatory Commission announced that the "Fund E-account" APP has been launched and is now undergoing public beta testing in various mobile app stores.
According to the introduction, the "Fund E-account" provides individual investors with a "one-stop" inquiry service for public fund accounts and share information, aiming to solve the industry service pain points such as small and medium investors forgetting their accounts and complicated inquiries.
According to data from Wind, by the end of 2022, there were a total of 156 public fund managers in China, managing approximately 26 trillion yuan in funds; there were 167 public fund share registration institutions and 411 public fund sales institutions.
Each share registration agency's account system operates independently, lacking a unified industry query channel.
Industry insiders have stated that by the end of 2021, China had over 720 million fund investors, meaning that half of the country's population had invested in fund products.
Previously, investors needed to inquire about purchase conditions through different sales institutions, but with the "Fund E-account", they can check the conditions of purchases made through all sales channels, making the status of fund holdings clear at a glance.
What is the "Fund E-account" APP?
According to related documents, the "Fund E-account" APP is a public fund industry portal mobile application developed and constructed by China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation Limited with the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission. It can provide investors with a one-stop query for the holding situation of off-market shares of all public fund products in the market.
Investors can conveniently and quickly grasp the holding situation of the off-market shares of public fund products managed by various fund managers purchased through all market sales channels through the "Fund E-account", greatly improving the efficiency of inquiries.
Specifically, the information that investors can access through the "Fund E-account" includes: the fund account information opened at all public fund managers in the market, the trading account information opened at public fund sales institutions, and the off-market shareholding situation of products including publicly-raised securities investment funds and collective asset management plans managed by securities companies, where the number of investors is not limited to 200.
Liu Yiqian, the head of business at the Shanghai Securities Fund Evaluation Research Center, told Economic Observer reporters that investors can use the "Fund E-account" App to get a one-stop understanding of all their off-market public fund holdings. This helps them recover "forgotten assets". More importantly, it provides customers with a comprehensive collection of information on their fund investment situation, helping them to grasp their own investment situation more timely, accurately, and completely. This in turn allows them to better optimize their fund portfolio allocation and plan their financial arrangements.
How to register for use?
The reporter noted that currently, the "Fund E-account" APP has been launched on mobile application stores such as Huawei, Apple, Xiaomi, OPPO, and Vivo. However, the APP is still in the public trial operation stage, and registration requires an invitation code. Investors can contact the fund manager of the funds they hold to obtain it.
A customer service representative from a medium to large public fund in Shanghai provided a six-digit invitation code to a reporter from Economic Observer Network, and told the reporter, "During the trial operation phase of the APP, China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation provides a certain number of invitation codes to each fund manager. When investors call to obtain them, we will provide them."
After the trial operation is over, there is no need for an invitation code when opening user registration.
You didn't provide any Chinese text to translate. Please provide the text you want to be translated.
The reporter registered an account and completed the inquiry based on the "Fund E-account" download and usage instructions related documents displayed on the official website of the China Securities Regulatory Commission. The whole process took only a few minutes and mainly consisted of four steps: user registration, real-name authentication, fund account binding, and public fund inquiry.
After completing the real-name authentication step, click on the "Assets" fund binding button. All the fund products purchased by the reporter through various fund sales platforms are displayed in the binding option list (accounts that can be bound). After completing the binding, you can directly see the total assets of the invested funds and start using the query function.
It is worth noting that the "Fund E-account" only provides inquiry services for investors and cannot be used for subscription and redemption transactions.
The data date displayed in "Fund E Account" is generally three trading days prior to the date (T day) the user makes the query.
For example, if you open the "Fund E Account" on February 10th, the total assets, fund shares, and net value of the fund displayed on the asset page correspond to the date three trading days before that date, which is February 7th.

United Against the CCP, US, Japan, and the Philippines Reach a Defense Consensus
Asia - On February 9, Philippine President Bongbong Marcos visited Japan and held talks with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.
Both parties reached a consensus on opposing the CCP's infringement on the South China Sea and the East China Sea. After the meeting, the leaders of the Philippines and Japan issued a joint statement, stating that they will sign a tripartite defense agreement with the United States, conduct substantive defense exchanges, and oppose the CCP's hegemonic policy.
According to Japanese media, Fumio Kishida hopes that this meeting will help Japan and the Philippines establish policies for the Taiwan Strait crisis.
Xiao Ma Ke Si visited China in early January this year and secured a deal worth 20 billion US dollars.
But after this, the relationship between China and the Philippines not only did not improve, but instead declined.
At the beginning of this month, the Philippines and the United States signed an agreement, agreeing to open more bases to the US military, to ensure the security of the South China Sea.
The newly added base is 300 kilometers away from Taiwan, and it is also the closest location to China.
If a crisis occurs in Taiwan, the US military may launch operations from their bases in the Philippines.
Japanese media believes that Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, and even the Philippines have now formed an axis with the United States, constructing a "confrontation arc against the Chinese Communist Party" in the Western Pacific to promote regional cooperation.
Kuomintang Vice Chairman Xia Liyan conveys Song Tao's message during his visit to China: Under the 1992 Consensus, the Green Camp is welcome to visit the mainland.
The Vice Chairman of the Kuomintang of China in Taiwan, Xia Liyan, during his visit to China, met with the Director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council of China, Song Tao, and the Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Wang Huning.
Zhao Chunshan, a senior advisor to the Kuomintang's official organization, the National Policy Foundation, positively evaluated Song Tao's statement to Xia Liyan in an interview with Taiwan's Central News Agency last night. He said that as long as one acknowledges the "1992 Consensus" and opposes Taiwan independence, China welcomes visits from the Green Camp to the mainland.
The Kuomintang side evaluates it as a novelty.
The news of the day did not mention this statement when Xia Liyan met with Song Tao earlier.
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party in Taiwan has been clarifying in recent days its refusal to accept the "1992 Consensus".
According to Central News Agency today, the vice chairman of the Kuomintang, Xia Liyan, led a delegation to visit mainland China. During his stay in Beijing, he met with Wang Huning, a standing member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Song Tao, the newly appointed director of the Taiwan Affairs Office, and Yin Li, the secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee.
During a meeting between Xia Liyan and Song Tao, they discussed that the political foundation of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is the "1992 Consensus" and opposition to Taiwan independence. Zhao Chunshan, a senior advisor to the Kuomintang's National Policy Foundation, stated in the meeting that the Kuomintang's "1992 Consensus" is the original and authentic "1992 Consensus".
Zhao Chunshan analyzed that this feels different from the previous meetings he participated in.
Recently, in video conferences with the mainland academic community, and in this discussion, we did not hear any scholars discussing military unification and the "Anti-Secession Law" in relation to Taiwan. Instead, the focus was on resuming exchanges and dialogue.
Zhao Chunshan pointed out that amid the dangerous military tensions across the strait, mainland China hopes to convey its intention to improve relations through the Kuomintang.
Because there is no mutual trust between the people, the other party still wants to do a good job for the people of Taiwan, representing that they do not want to spoil the cross-strait relations.
According to Zhao Chunshan, Wang Huning personally instructed Song Tao, saying "You must implement the demands raised by them (Taiwanese farmers and fishermen)". If it is impossible to solve the problem as a whole, individual cases should also be handled.
The report did not mention whether the Kuomintang members brought up the issue of Chinese military aircraft and warships harassing Taiwan daily, the agricultural and fishing issues in a few counties and cities of Taiwan, and whether the Central News Agency reporters asked about these issues during their interviews.
The Legal Union once again mobilizes a large march against the government's retirement reform plan.
On Saturday (February 11), French unions once again launched a nationwide mobilization against the government's pension reform bill, calling on the public to take to the streets to express their opinions.
This is the fourth day of action in the social movement against the government's pension reform draft.
The number of people responding to the rally call may affect the next action plan of the union groups.
This marks the fourth nationwide mobilization initiated jointly by France's eight major trade unions in the past month, and it is also the first time that the protest activities have been scheduled for a Saturday.
Given that for most French people, Saturday is a public holiday, they do not need to choose between participating in protest demonstrations or losing wages due to strikes. Therefore, union groups hope that today's rally can attract more people to participate.
The unions of the public transit system, subway, and public railway companies did not call for a strike today, so the public transit system should be able to operate normally. Citizens can take public transportation to the rally site. Meanwhile, in areas where schools have started winter vacation, people can start their holidays as usual.
The union group hopes that more than one million people will participate in the rally today, while the police expect the nationwide participation to be between 600,000 and 800,000. In the city of Paris, the turnout could be between 90,000 and 120,000 people.
Since the start of the protests against the government's pension reform plan, although polls show that the majority of French people do not support the measure to delay the legal retirement age from the current 62 to 64, the number of people actually taking to the streets to participate in the marches has gradually decreased.
The first strike demonstration on January 31st rallied between 1.27 million to 2.5 million people nationwide.
And this Tuesday (February 7th), the number of demonstrators has shrunk to between 757,000 and 2 million nationwide.
This pension reform plan is currently under discussion in the French National Assembly.
The opposition party, especially the radical left-wing-led opposition group, has submitted countless amendment proposals, resulting in a very slow review process.
And the debate between the ruling party and the opposition is becoming increasingly fierce and sharp.
A member of the radical left-wing party, France Unbowed, recently posted a picture on social media of himself stepping on a balloon with the image of the Minister of Labor, sparking protests from the ruling party.
The Speaker of the National Assembly ultimately announced a 15-day ban on this member from participating in parliamentary activities as a punishment for this behavior.
Despite this reform plan sparking the largest social movement in France in over 20 years, up to now, the government has made only minor adjustments to the draft and has not made any significant concessions.
The union is prepared to take action again on Thursday next week, which is the 16th. On March 7th, when the reform draft was submitted to the Senate for discussion, the union also planned to organize a demonstration.
China encourages increasing birth rate, urges universities for sperm donations with high quality standards.
The Human Sperm Bank of Yunnan Province, China, issued a call on the 9th for donations from individuals with a college degree or higher, or current students. Successful donors who donate 8 to 12 times can receive a subsidy of 4500 yuan.
According to reports from Taiwanese media today, the message surged to the top of Weibo's hot search list, and sparked follow-up initiatives in many provinces and cities such as Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hubei, Shandong, and Beijing.
According to a report by Liberty Times, China is encouraging university students to donate sperm.
Various universities across the country have sperm donation programs, among which Beijing has the highest requirements. In addition to educational background, they also require a height of over 170 cm, well-proportioned facial features, no obvious hair loss, and nearsightedness not exceeding 600 degrees.
According to the report, the Yunnan Province Human Sperm Bank stated that sperm donors can receive a full set of men's health check-ups worth 1000 RMB, "especially semen and chromosome tests, most people have never done them before, which are of great significance for understanding their own fertility status."
The conditions for sperm donors include being over 165 cm tall, having a college degree or currently studying, and not having any genetic diseases or infectious diseases such as color blindness or hepatitis B.
The report cites China's Tianmu News as saying that the Shaanxi Province Human Sperm Bank has printed promotional posters with the slogan "Paid sperm donation, unlimited glory", calling on young people to respond to sperm donation and encouraging netizens to share related information, "passing on the love".
The price in Shaanxi Province is higher than in Yunnan, with those who qualify able to receive 300 yuan in cash each time. Those who complete a certain number of sperm donations can receive a subsidy of 5000 yuan.
And currently, the highest known price is in Beijing, with the highest subsidy being 5150 RMB.
The last Prime Minister of East Germany from the Communist Party passed away today.
The successor of the East German Communist Party reported in a statement, "Last night, Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95."
Therefore, our party has lost an important leader.
You didn't provide any Chinese text. Please provide the text you want to be translated.
On November 13, 1989, four days after the Berlin Wall, which had separated East and West Berlin for 28 years, was opened, Modrow stated that he would help transform East Germany into a democratic country.
At that time, due to protesters across East Germany demanding democracy and freedom, the Communist Party leaders were forced to step down.
After coming to power in the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev had demanded reforms in Eastern Europe, which was dominated by the Soviet Union.
In March 1990, Modrow announced the first and only free election of the German Democratic Republic (GDR).
The election results led to him no longer serving as Prime Minister.
Despite Modro's reforms, opponents accused him of trying to delay the political changes and unification that occurred in October 1990.
He was also criticized for trying to reshape rather than abolish the secret police.
In 1993, Modro was found guilty of election fraud in the municipal elections of May 1989, but he did not go to jail.
Some say that these allegations are politically motivated.
From 1990 to 1994, Modro continued to serve in the German Parliament, and from 1999 to 2004, he served as a member of the European Parliament.
Modro considers himself a reformer and hopes to change the Communist Party from within.
In 1999, he told Reuters that he did not wish for the return of former East Germany, but stated that the achievements of East Germany should be recognized.
Modro was born in 1928 in the small German town of Jasenitz (now Jasienica in Poland), and received training as a mechanic.
During the Second World War, he served as the captain of a youth firefighting team, and as the conflict was nearing its end, he became a member of the Nazi militia organization Volkssturm, which conscripted men aged 16 to 60 to participate in the final struggle of the war.
At the age of 17, Modro was captured by the Soviet army and taken to the Soviet Union as a prisoner of war. There, he participated in anti-fascist courses and became a staunch Communist Party member.
In 1949, the year East Germany was established, he returned to his country and found a job as a mechanic, continued to study social sciences and economics, and earned a doctorate degree.
Modro is a staff member of the Free German Youth Movement, which almost all young people in East Germany joined, and from 1973 to 1989, he was promoted to the chairman of the party in the Dresden region by the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED).
He served in the East German parliament for over 30 years.
In 1990, Modrow became the de facto leader of East Germany, holding the highest state office.
Iran commemorates the anniversary of the revolution, hackers supporting the protest hacked the president's television speech.
The Islamic Republic of Iran held an official rally on Saturday to commemorate the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, but anti-government hackers briefly interrupted President Ebrahim Raisi's televised speech.
The President's live television speech was interrupted on the internet for about a minute, during which a logo of a group of hackers against the Iranian government appeared on the screen. Their name is "Edalat Ali (Ali Justice)".
There was also a voice shouting, "Death to the Islamic Republic."
According to a report by Reuters today, Iran is commemorating the anniversary of the revolution, and hackers have interrupted national television broadcasts.
On the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, the hardline government in Tehran faces the boldest challenge yet from young protesters demanding their resignation. However, Tehran continues to call for the "deceived youth" to repent, so they can receive pardon from Iran's supreme leader.
Nationwide protests continue to sweep across Iran following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died in the custody of the country's morality police in September.
Iran's security forces have carried out a deadly crackdown on protest activities, which represents one of the most significant challenges faced by the Islamic Republic since the overthrow of the 2500-year-old monarchy in the 1979 revolution.
As part of the annual revolutionary amnesty, Iranian authorities released the imprisoned dissident Fahad Mesami, who had been on a hunger strike, and the Iranian-French scholar Fariba Adelkhah on Friday.
Earlier, the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a general amnesty, which included some prisoners who were arrested in recent anti-government protest activities.
According to a report by the human rights organization HRANA, as of Friday, 528 protesters have been killed, including 71 minors.
The report says that another 70 government security personnel have been killed.
It is believed that as many as 19,763 protesters have been arrested.
For several weeks, Iranian leaders and official media have been urging people to vote in the rally on Saturday, to show opposition to protest activities and support for the government.
On the evening of Friday's anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, official media showcased fireworks as part of the government-sponsored celebration, with people shouting "Allahu Akbar!"
(God is the greatest!)".
However, in the gathering, you could also hear many people shouting, "Death to the dictator!"
And the "Death of the Islamic Republic" in the videos posted on social media.
On Saturday, the government television station broadcasted live recordings of official gatherings from all over the country.
In Tehran, as part of the official celebration activities, domestically produced anti-ballistic missiles, drones, anti-submarine cruisers, and other military equipment were displayed.
President Lai Xi's speeches are often interrupted by the slogan "Down with America" - this is a signature slogan at state rallies.
The crowd also shouted "Death to Israel".
Reuters reports that Adelkhah, who has been in prison since 2019, is one of seven French nationals detained in Iran, a factor contributing to the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran in recent months.
She was sentenced to five years in prison for national security crimes in 2020.
They later put her under house arrest, but she returned to prison in January.
Adelkhah denied these allegations.
A week before Mesami was released, supporters warned that he was at risk of death due to his hunger strike protest.
He was arrested in 2018 for protesting against the mandatory wearing of headscarves.
The French Foreign Ministry responded on Friday to Adelkhah's release, calling for the restoration of her freedom, "including, if she wishes, she should be allowed to return to France."

Does the balloon incident further open America's eyes?
Strengthen restrictions on technology exports to China
According to a report by The Wall Street Journal today, following the balloon incident, the United States is preparing to further tighten technology exports to China.
Current and former security officials stated that the aforementioned balloon incident highlights the national security threat posed by China, and will garner more political support for strengthening US technology protection.
The United States claims that the balloon carried antennas and sensors used for intelligence gathering and communication.
According to Martijn Rasser, a former senior official of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, who is now working at the New America Security Center, a think tank in Washington.
"This undoubtedly adds fuel to the fire, supporting the hardliner's view against China."
White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said to reporters on Thursday, "We will also consider taking broader actions to expose and address China's larger-scale surveillance activities, which pose a threat to our national security as well as our allies and partners.
"U.S. officials said they have informed the governments of more than 30 countries about the aforementioned balloon incident, and international coordination is crucial in dealing with the threat from China."
Senior researcher Emily Benso from the Center for Strategic and International Studies said that in addition to the actions of the Biden administration, the newly established U.S. House of Representatives' Special Committee on Strategic Competition with the Chinese Communist Party could also pressure the U.S. to take stricter measures to slow down China's development.
She said that members of Congress will feel increasing pressure to take a tougher stance, which could in turn force the White House to adopt more stringent policies.
The Wall Street Journal reports that many advocates for stricter export controls are also pushing to expand the scope of these controls to include industries such as artificial intelligence.
The U.S. government is also formulating a foreign investment review plan, examining whether there are potential national security threats from China in U.S. overseas investments.
Analysts say the White House may face calls to roll out the plan more quickly.
Relief efforts for the earthquake in Syria continue day and night
Since the strong earthquake occurred in Turkey and neighboring Syria, rescue teams from dozens of countries have been working tirelessly day and night among the ruins of thousands of destroyed buildings, rescuing survivors buried under the rubble.
In the freezing temperatures, they often urged for silence, as they strained to hear any signs of life from the pile of dilapidated concrete.
According to a report by Reuters today, two more women have been rescued from the rubble of an earthquake after surviving for several days.
However, the death toll from the earthquake has risen to 24,150 people.
The death toll in Turkey is 20,665 people, and the death toll in Syria has exceeded 3,500 people.
The 7.8 magnitude earthquake that occurred on Monday, followed by several strong aftershocks in Turkey and Syria, is the seventh deadliest natural disaster of this century. It surpassed the earthquake and tsunami in Japan in 2011 and is close to the 31,000 deaths caused by the earthquake in neighboring Iran in 2003.
The strong earthquake that occurred in the northwest of Turkey in 1999 resulted in the death of over 17,000 people.
Turkish authorities said on Saturday that two women were trapped for 122 hours after the deadliest earthquake in the region in 20 years. Rescue workers in Turkey saved these two women from the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Another injured 55-year-old man has been identified as Masallah Cicek, who was rescued from the ruins of a collapsed building in Diyarbakir, the largest city in southeastern Turkey.
In the freezing temperatures, rescuers often urge for silence, as they strive to hear any signs of life from the pile of dilapidated concrete.
In the Samandag district of Turkey, rescue workers crouched under concrete slabs, whispering "Inshallah" - "God willing" - as they carefully reached into the rubble to rescue a 10-day-old newborn.
He opened his eyes wide, baby Yagiz Ulas was wrapped in a warm blanket and carried to the field hospital.
The video footage shows that the emergency personnel also took his mother away, who was dizzy and pale on the stretcher, but remained conscious.
Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay told reporters overnight that within the past 24 hours, 67 people have been rescued from the rubble, with a total of 31,000 rescue workers deployed in the disaster area.
He said that approximately 80,000 people are receiving treatment in hospitals, and 1.05 million people have been left homeless by the earthquake, crowding into temporary shelters.
Due to many people lacking food in the cold winter conditions, there is increasing public skepticism towards the disaster response of the leaders of the two countries.
According to Syrian official media, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his wife Asma visited a hospital in Aleppo. This is reportedly his first visit to the disaster area since the earthquake.
Earlier, the World Food Programme stated that due to the complexities caused by the state of war, its stock in the rebel-controlled northwestern part of Syria is about to run out.
On Friday, Erdogan visited Adiyaman province in Turkey, where he admitted that the government's response did not meet the expected speed.
Opponents seized on this issue to attack Erdogan, who is running for re-election in the vote scheduled for May 14, but it may be postponed due to the disaster.
Reuters reports that anger over the delay in providing aid and initiating rescue work could potentially impact the election.
Even before the earthquake occurred, the vote was seen as the most serious challenge to Erdogan's rule in twenty years.
Erdogan calls for unity and condemns what he calls the "negative campaign for political gain".
The leader of Turkey's main opposition party, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, criticized the government's response.
Critics say, "The earthquake was massive, but what's even more serious is the lack of coordination, lack of planning, and incompetence."

Hanoi - Vietnam News Agency special correspondent reports, during his visit to Brunei Darussalam, on the morning of February 11, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and his wife visited the University of Brunei Darussalam (UBD, also known as "University of Brunei").
The University of Brunei is the largest higher education and scientific research center in Brunei, ranking third in the local university rankings.
The University of Brunei is one of the symbols of cooperation in education and training between Vietnam and Brunei.
The University of Brunei officially established a partnership with Vietnam's FPT University in July 2013, with the main area of cooperation being English language training.
In addition to foreign languages such as English, French, German, Japanese, and Korean, the University of Brunei has also incorporated Vietnamese into its curriculum.
During his visit to the University of Brunei, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and his wife interacted with students from the Vietnamese language class.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng is pleased that more and more foreigners are interested in learning Vietnamese, and is actively contributing to the promotion of Vietnamese cultural characteristics and local customs to the world.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng expressed his belief and hope that the team of Vietnamese language teachers at the University of Brunei will continue to grow stronger; more and more students in the Vietnamese language classes are becoming interested in the Vietnamese language, studying hard, and hoping to use fluent Vietnamese as soon as possible, and become ambassadors of the friendly cooperation between Vietnam and Brunei.
Taking this opportunity, Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng also communicated with Vietnamese students studying English at the FPT-UBD Global Center in Da Nang City via video, understanding their learning situation, especially during the pandemic.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng believes that the cooperative relationship between Vietnam's FPT University and the University of Brunei, especially the FPT-UBD Global Center, is a vivid symbol of the educational cooperation between Vietnam and Brunei.
At the same time, it is hoped that the students of this center will make greater progress in their studies and make positive contributions to the friendly cooperation between the two countries.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng highly praised the achievements made in educational cooperation between the two countries during his discussions with the Minister of Education and the leaders of the University of Brunei. This includes the cooperation between FPT University and the University of Brunei, as well as the initiative of the University of Brunei to include Vietnamese in their curriculum.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng hopes that the University of Brunei will continue to focus on ensuring the quality of Vietnamese language teaching and further expand the scale of Vietnamese language classes.
Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh highly praised the positive results achieved through the cooperation based on the Memorandum of Understanding on Educational Cooperation signed between the two countries in April 2014. He suggested that Brunei continue to provide more scholarships and effectively carry out various short-term exchange training programs, such as the Global Discovery Programme and Discovery Year, etc.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng highly appreciates the establishment of the first branch of the University of Brunei in Vietnam in Southeast Asia; he believes that the development scale of the university is increasingly strong in the region and the world; and further expands the cooperative relationship with Vietnamese higher education institutions.
Taking this opportunity, Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng and his wife planted a commemorative tree within the campus of the University of Brunei, and left a message in the commemorative book.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng wishes that the University of Brunei will continue to develop and contribute increasingly to the educational cause of Brunei, and also carry out deeper and broader cooperation with various educational and training institutions in Vietnam.

Vietnam News Agency
Hanoi - VNA special correspondent reports, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and his spouse's official visit to Singapore and Brunei has been successfully concluded, achieving comprehensive, pragmatic and specific results.
Within the three days of visiting Singapore and Brunei, Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng participated in more than 30 different activities.
The achievements obtained have injected new momentum into the continuous development of the strategic partnership between Vietnam and Singapore, and the comprehensive partnership with Vietnam, towards a deeper, broader and more effective direction.
During his visit to the two countries, Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng continued to reiterate the foreign policy of the Vietnamese Party and state, which is to be independent, diversified, adaptable, willing to be a good friend and reliable partner to all countries, as well as a responsible member of the international community.
Strengthening relations with Singapore and Brunei is a necessity for each respective country, dedicated to enhancing the welfare of their own people, and committed to regional and global peace, stability, and development.
At various meetings and talks, Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng and the leaders of Singapore and Brunei unanimously agreed to continuously strengthen political mutual trust with Vietnam through methods such as mutual visits by high-level delegations, effective implementation of various bilateral cooperation mechanisms, and important cooperation agreements.
Many cooperative documents were signed during this visit.
Among them, the "Memorandum of Understanding on Green and Digital Economy Partnership" signed with Singapore and the "Action Plan for Strengthening the Comprehensive Partnership with Brunei from 2023 to 2027" are the two highlights.

During his visit to the two countries, Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng arranged time to visit and listen to the thoughts and wishes of the Vietnamese community living locally.
During the meeting between the leaders of the two countries, Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng suggested that the authorities of both countries pay more attention to, and ensure fair treatment for, the local Vietnamese community. This would provide them with the opportunity to contribute to the local society and foster favorable conditions for the development of relations between the two countries.
The proposal has received the approval and support of the leaders of both countries.
What's special is that Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng also shared with the leaders of the two countries the desire for a united, peaceful, stable, and prosperous ASEAN community; they unanimously agreed to maintain unity and cooperation with ASEAN countries and enhance ASEAN's central role in the context of complex and changing regional and international situations.
Leveraging the significant achievements made, Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng's official visit to Singapore and Brunei has actively contributed to the effective implementation of the foreign policy prioritizing strengthening relations with ASEAN neighbors, as set out by the 13th Communist Party of Vietnam. It also effectively implemented the 12th conclusion (12-KL/TW) of the Central Political Bureau of the Communist Party of Vietnam on overseas Vietnamese affairs under the new situation, and promoted the unity of the entire nation.

What exactly is the "object" that was shot down over Alaska?
Intriguing and puzzling, speculations abound.
The U.S. military once again deployed its most advanced stealth jet, the F-22, on Friday afternoon (February 10th) to shoot down an unidentified object flying over Alaska.
The location where it was shot down is ten miles from the Alaska coast.
This is the second time in less than a week that the US military has shot down an airborne object.
Last Saturday, a spy balloon from China, which had been drifting in US airspace for several days, was destroyed over the coast of South Carolina.
The Pentagon stated that the second object that was shot down first entered U.S. airspace on Thursday night. It was tracked by the U.S. military as it moved over northeastern Alaska at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet). Its size was roughly equivalent to a small car, which is much smaller compared to the previous Chinese spy balloon that was shot down.
The Pentagon also believes that currently there are no signs indicating that this object can be manipulated.
John Kirby, the Strategic Communications Coordinator for the White House National Security Council, said on Friday that although the specific appearance of this high-flying object is still unclear, it "poses a reasonable threat to the safety of civil aviation".
Kobe stated that this object is different from the spy balloon found within the United States, as it does not have a "payload" hanging from it.
Kobe said, "Calling it an 'object' is the best description we can give at the moment."
President Biden took advice from the Pentagon before ordering the object to be shot down, and he was "very cautious" when making this decision, Kobe added.
The U.S. official description of this object can be roughly summarized as: its size is equivalent to a small car, it has no joystick, no suspension device, and its flight altitude is about 10,000 meters.
But this information still cannot answer basic questions, such as what exactly is this object, which country does it belong to, and what task is it performing.
Many current online analyses and speculations suggest that this might be another Chinese balloon.
It may originate from China, just like the spy balloon that invaded US airspace and the Chinese balloon floating over Latin America, each carrying out certain tasks at different locations.
Some people also associate this "object" in Alaska with "Unidentified Flying Objects" (UFO).
A report by U.S. Newsweek quoted a tweet from former U.S. Congressman Peter Meijer on Friday saying, "I really hope this 'unidentified flying object' is just a spy balloon, not a legitimate UFO."
"It's surprising that there's a sarcastic tone in confusing alien spacecraft with weather balloons, but it's not worth sparking an interstellar conflict," said Meijie.
Mei Jie tweeted this shortly after Kobe confirmed that the object in Alaska had been shot down.
Newsweek said that Meijie is not the only one who suspects that this object is a UFO.
Tennessee Republican Representative Tim Burchett criticized the government's cover-up of intelligence last month, calling on the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to release reports on "Unidentified Flying Objects".
The attitude of Amazon's customer service is hard for me to believe.
I guess very few people have seen this, but I still want to mention it briefly.
When we purchased this item, it was a zip-up hoodie, but what was finally delivered to me was a short-sleeved shirt.
After receiving the clothes, I immediately contacted Amazon's customer service. At that time, it was confirmed that the clothes were still in stock. I requested an exchange, and the customer service said they would resolve it. Then I immediately saw the product name changed to short sleeves, and the link I originally bought was taken off the shelf.
Then, the customer service notified that either keep the goods and receive a certain amount of compensation, or return the goods.
Is this how Amazon handles it?
It's really hard to believe, the mistake in the clothing sent was not my fault. As a consumer, I only asked for the item I should have received, without making any exaggerated demands. Yet, Amazon changed the name and said it was out of stock.
This is my first long review, I hope it's not my last.
Incomprehensible Sleeve
They say it's made of cowhide, and it is indeed quite hard, but upon closer inspection, there are many small cracks in certain areas, making it unclear whether it's genuine leather. Additionally, the sleeves of this garment are truly incomprehensible. Usually, the sleeves of a jacket are slightly longer than the hem, but typically only by 1-2 centimeters. However, the sleeves of this garment are a full 5 centimeters longer. When the arm is naturally hanging down, the sleeve should end at the base of the palm, but the sleeves of this garment cover the fingers.
Buying clothes is easy, and returning them is also easy.
But when will the money really be refunded?
The quality of the clothes is good, but I had to return them because the size is too small. However, it's been over a week since I returned the items, and I still haven't received a refund?
Moreover, the buyer has to contact Quanfeng Express, which is not very reliable, by themselves. This is the worst shopping experience I've had since buying items from Amazon!
The shop owner is still pretty good, actively cooperating to urge the courier to refund in time. However, the work of this Quanfeng Express is really infuriating, dragging on for about half a month before refunding. Such a partner is going to hold back Amazon, with poor work efficiency and no service awareness!
More suitable for young people
Killed in 99 seconds.
The craftsmanship, color, and feel of the woolen pants are all good, they are soft and moderately thick, without any kerosene smell.
Unfortunately, the style is slim fit, which is more suitable for young people.
3XL, flat waist measurement is 2.5 feet, maximum stretch size is 4 feet, it's a bit tight around the waist for someone who is 1.79 meters tall and weighs 80 kilograms.
It seems there is no elastic band at the waist, so it's quite difficult to loosen the waistline.
Additionally, wearing tight clothes is uncomfortable.
Very good, the color is not very bright.
The price increased by more than two hundred right after I bought it, what's going on?
This is the first time Amazon used the terrible "Everyday Express" delivery service. The first time they attempted delivery, I wasn't home. I then took the initiative to arrange two more delivery times with the courier, but he didn't show up for either. Eventually, they just returned my package. This damn courier has no integrity at all. I strongly suggest not using this "Everyday Express" delivery service anymore.
This time, a t-shirt was also returned to me, and if I were to order it again, the price has increased by more than one hundred yuan.
Amazon's self-operated platform should not have such products.
I bought the product when it was on sale, the price was not low, but according to the reviews, it's a pretty good product.
When I actually received the product, I was dumbfounded. There was extensive wear on the surface of the product, and multiple other areas were also worn. It's either a substandard product or a used one. I will upload pictures later.
I requested a return, but the manufacturer's representative claimed the damage was caused by transportation after seeing the photos. Isn't that a baseless claim?
How could there possibly be wear and tear inside the product?
There are only two possibilities, either the goods are substandard or used, or I deliberately damaged the goods and then returned them.
Objectively speaking, I have no evidence to prove that I did not damage the goods, but considering my credit record of shopping on Amazon, I believe such goods should not appear in Amazon's self-operated products. Customers choose Amazon's self-operated products because they trust them. When the customer wins, we win. The customer's victory is the manufacturer's victory. I hope everyone will work together to improve. Thank you.
I have been using this product for less than a year, and two E2 errors have occurred. I don't know how to handle it?
I purchased this product on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016, the right side of the receiver often displayed a red E2, which seems to indicate a problem with the transmitter module. This doesn't quite match what Amazon's website says about the transmitter module being able to work continuously for 7 years. I can't find any after-sales service on Amazon's website, so I'm not sure what to do now?
It's okay.
The first purchase was bad.
It doesn't feel like new.
The label on the box has been torn off, and the label on the machine body is also damaged.
And it always shows a white screen.
It got better after changing it.
The exchange was quite fast, it's a bit blurry at night, the viewing angle is not very wide, but it's enough for regular home use.
The only downside is that it doesn't come with a card, I bought it myself, and I have previously bought a phone on Amazon.
There would usually be a sticker on the packaging to prevent it from being opened, but it's not there this time. When buying a phone, there would also be a sticker-like seal that could be attached to the warranty card, but it's not there this time either.
I'm not sure if things are gone because they are cheap, it's very confusing.
Waiting for a response from the supplier.
The packaging had no markings, so I directly called the supplier. They responded that the lack of markings indicates it's a genuine product. If in doubt, I could send a sample to Johnson & Johnson for verification. They also left their license plate number and phone number, promising to send a text message notifying me that my information has been entered into the Johnson & Johnson warranty card on their official website. But until now, I haven't received any text message.
Received the engine oil in the morning and replaced it in the afternoon.
Second purchase.
Amazon's self-operated products are quite reliable.
The mechanic who changed the oil said the oil is clear and bright, indeed it is good oil.
Because it is the second time I have purchased.
So, I am still very reassured.
The delivery was very fast, the packaging was impeccable, and after using this oil, the engine noise noticeably decreased.
The cost performance is good, it's hard to find synthetic motor oil under 200.
Support Star Crown, support Winning Card, effective protection for cars.
Amazon Japan has seriously damaged the interests of buyers due to customer service issues (an 8c caterpillar was delivered as an 8cm caterpillar) (8c=14cm, 8cm=2c).
Admitting the mistake, but constantly shirking responsibility, always emphasizing that the goods belong to a third party, and cannot bind the third party.
Order number: 503-4265464-1830254.
When I initially made the purchase, the size options on the page were 7c, 8, 9c. At that time, I felt this was a trap, so I called the Japanese Amazon Chinese customer service. They clearly told me that 8 meant 8c. However, when the product arrived in China, I found out it was only 8cm. I believe this was a deliberate trap set to cheat Chinese customers (according to Amazon's after-sales service). Now, this option is no longer available on the page.
Chinese Customer Service: We apologize for causing you a loss. We offer you two options:
1, You return the goods, the buyer bears all shipping costs.
2, if you don't return the goods, we will compensate you 1000 yen.
(Let me calculate, the shoes cost more than 4000 yen, which is about 200 RMB. If I choose option 1, which is not having shoes, the loss would be 200 yuan.
I chose option 2, I have the shoes, and was finally compensated 2000 yen, with a final loss of 150 RMB. Customer Service: We have recorded this, we will handle it seriously. The next day, I received an email saying that if I do not accept mediation from the Chinese customer service, then it's over.
I suggest: When purchasing pages like 7c, 8, 9c, which are confusing options, the Chinese customer service told me that commonly used codes in Japan do not include 'c' like this, similar to 140. But have you guys ever bothered to check other caterpillar pages?
There are both US and Japanese sizes available, and cases of mixed labeling may occur.
Moreover, why did you put 8cm between 7c and 9c? It's clearly the smallest size, what's the point of placing it there?
Chinese Customer Service: We provide services in Chinese, but we didn't know you wanted to ship back to your country, so we won't compensate for your shipping costs.
I don't understand this logic. I am Japanese, but I still need Chinese customer service. Chinese people living in Japan don't need Chinese customer service either. Tourists in Japan don't have the time to make international calls. So, the question arises, who needs to make calls to Amazon's overseas purchase Chinese hotline? It's probably just people like me who shop on Japanese websites.
Isn't Amazon's Chinese customer service just to facilitate us, the people who shop overseas?
I am not very satisfied with this purchase.
This is the second time I have purchased Pampers diapers from Amazon. I once bought a box when the baby was two months old, choosing diapers made from European imported paper. I was quite satisfied with my first purchase experience. The baby only used one diaper for the whole night, which indeed can last for 12 hours without changing.
However, this time I bought size L diapers, and there were 2 separate packages in a box. After opening, I felt that the paper was rather loose, which was significantly different from the imported Pampers. After using them for my baby, they were acceptable, with no signs of leakage or diaper rash.
However, upon starting the second pack of diapers, a rash immediately appeared on the inner side of the baby's thigh, which has not faded until now.
Suspecting that the quality of the two packages inside one box is not the same.
I probably won't continue to buy in the future!
Hope to pay attention to the transportation protection of the package.
This is the worst packaging and shipping I've seen in all my time shopping online. There were absolutely no protective measures, no bubble wrap, no cushioning material, nothing at all.
Just a deformed box.
Moreover, the soft plastic box inside was packaged in such a way that the box was squashed open and deformed.
I hope it is genuine and the quality is guaranteed. I am not very confident about buying things from Amazon in the future.
I'd rather it be twice as expensive domestically, as long as it's more secure.
Moreover, regarding the issue with the product packaging, I saw comments from as early as 2016. Now it's 2019, and it's still the same.
This indicates that Amazon does not value customer service feedback at all, which is far behind domestic platforms like JD.com and Tmall.
Good-looking, but a little bit disappointing.
The color of the entire cup is one I really like, orange-red. Even though I have a boy at home, I still think that orange-red paired with yellow is very eye-catching.
It's smaller than I imagined, but it's meant to be used on the go, so it's still acceptable.
I brought it home to try last night, and after opening the bottle cap, I found that the distance between the straw and the cap was too close. Because the position of the straw is vertically upward, my son always has to cover the protrusion on the cap to drink water. I wonder if this part can be improved.
It seems that there is a reason why other brands make their straw cups slanted. When it comes to children's items, safety and comfort really matter.
Lightweight and Large Capacity
I like that it's lightweight and has a large opening, but the two separate compartments seem a bit redundant to me. I'm not sure what to put in them.
After purchasing, I found out that there is a similar product from another brand on the overseas purchase section of Amazon, and it costs less than two hundred yuan.
Fake goods, extremely fake.
I'm really fed up with Amazon selling counterfeit goods.
The customer service said that because it has been used, it cannot be returned. How would I know it's a fake if I didn't use it?
Because of trust, it leads to disappointment. After all, it's a facial product. It's better to buy it from a physical store, even if it's a bit more expensive.
Because it was a flash sale, I didn't check the reviews. I have already reported this to the State Administration for Industry and Commerce's e-commerce platform. Let's protect our rights together.
Is it broken?
Fake goods?
In short, it's a tragedy.
When I used the second piece, I chose the one for refined pores. However, as soon as I opened it, there was a strange smell. I thought it was normal because I had never used this product before. But when I applied it to my face, I couldn't stand it. The smell was very strong, indescribable. It made me cough immediately, my eyes were in pain and I was tearing up. I had to take it off and wash my face immediately.
I didn't believe it and opened another one of the same kind, it doesn't have such a strong smell now, and I'm currently applying it.
Recalling, it smells a bit like the inferior perm solution in a hair salon.
It's hard to imagine, do we have to avoid Amazon's own skincare products from now on?
Unscrupulous merchant
At the time of purchase, the promotion page stated that a "Three-Body Trilogy" would be given as a gift for purchases over 99 yuan. However, I did not receive this gift when the goods arrived. When I called customer service, they asked me to show them a screenshot of the promotion at that time. The problem is, who takes screenshots of web pages when they make purchases? You conducted the promotion, yet you need customers to provide evidence for you? Fellow buyers, be careful next time and keep evidence.
Post-use Experience
This is my first time buying something on Amazon, and I have several impressions to share. Let's start with my experience after using the product. Firstly, it was indeed painless and there was no irritating smell, overall it was quite good. After waiting for about 8 minutes, it came off with just a wipe. There were only a few hair residues left on the surface, which are not noticeable unless you look closely. So overall, it was good. As for the future, I will need to continue observing after using it once, and only by continuing to use it will I know more.
Anyway, I think this thing is really good.
Secondly, I placed the order on the 27th and received the goods on the 12th, a total of 15 days or half a month. The delivery service attitude of Amazon's courier was also very good.
Thirdly, don't believe in Amazon's Black Friday deals. I placed an order on Friday and after waiting for 2 days, the price dropped by nearly 12 dollars. So, I ended up paying more than 170 dollars (including shipping and other charges). It feels like they raise the prices during sales events.
The customer service mentioned something about price fluctuations, but I've been monitoring it for over 10 days and the price has been pretty stable, with not much fluctuation.
Affordable price, made in Japan, with Chinese labels, granulated, will definitely repurchase!
The paste with granules in it feels just right, leaving your teeth smooth after use. It's much better than some second-hand stuff, which is said to be imported, but many items don't have Chinese labels, so it's unclear where they are wholesaled from.
From now on, as long as Amazon has it, I will never go to JD.com again.
Here's a suggestion, sometimes I can't post reviews on Amazon's app, I hope some improvements can be made to the application, it will get better and better!
Excellence has been declining over the years, there is no service quality to speak of!
The terrible service completely disregards customer needs. When placing an order, the special delivery time is from 19:00 to 22:00.
Because there is an elderly person at home who is bedridden after surgery and it's inconvenient for them, we can only conveniently receive packages in the evening.
Surprisingly, they delivered it directly to the door at 12 noon without giving any prior notice over the phone.
If the delivery time is at the whim of your couriers, delivering whenever they want, then why bother pretending to let customers choose a time?
If your own logistics can't guarantee service, then you might as well not do e-commerce at all!
Making an elderly person with three wounds on his body get out of bed to open the door, receive a delivery, and even find change to pay!
The contact number is clearly on the order!
No one bothered to call and give an explanation from beginning to end!
The so-called customer service for complaints at Zhuoyue Network is just a bunch of outsiders pretending, dealing with your complaints perfunctorily and then giving you a so-called response.
There will be no changes or compensation!
I had encountered similar issues with incorrect delivery times before and tolerated it, but this time it's unbearable, it's too much!
The new book I pre-ordered arrived with the front and back covers reversed. How could they overlook such an obvious quality issue and send the book to the customer like this?
Leaving a negative review or comment will not result in anyone contacting you.
Excellence has been declining over the years, there is no service quality to speak of!
I will not spend another dime on Excellence.
The quality of the picture is simply unacceptable.
As a book titled "Ancient Map Collection", the choice of images, layout, and printing in this book is truly unacceptable. Some images even have mosaics, blurred to the point of being unrecognizable.
Even if this book is not a professional atlas, even if it is just small illustrations, it should do justice to the grand collection of medieval literature left by our ancestors in the catalog!
(Besides, many images can be obtained in high resolution from relevant industry resources), what's the difference between using such images to piece together a book and not using images at all?
I regret such a spirit of scholarship.
No comments will be made regarding the text, each family has their own discernment.
Overall 2 stars.
When I was in my second year of high school, I read this book out of boredom, thinking that I wouldn't get addicted to such a book. After all, online literature from Qidian has never been particularly appealing to me.
Then... I fell into the pit.
According to the plot, the entire book is relatively relaxed and enjoyable. In the early part when Ye Xiu was still in the online game, even if there were intrigues between guilds, it was never heavy because Ye Xiu often made it melodramatic.
As for the part about the competition, it conveyed a bit of the bittersweet feeling of the changing times and the alternation of the old and the new (perhaps I'm just sentimental).
Reading the entire book took up a lot of my study time in my second year of high school, but I just couldn't stop.
The full-time depiction of characters and emotional lines is very stunning. Some characters are only occasionally mentioned, but they also leave a deep impression. Characters like Ye Xiu, Huang Shaotian, and Su Mucheng, who are more heavily depicted, have a large number of fans. Even characters not at the center of the writing, such as Jiang Bota and Chu Yunxiu, are also very popular. Surprisingly, in an e-sports novel, there is not a single character that is extremely disliked. This is the success of Full-Time in character depiction.
In terms of emotional storyline, unlike the common criticism of online novels having a harem of thirty million beauties or rotten girls, all the characters in this novel share a common trait: they all love the game "Glory" and most of them desire a fair and square victory.
There is no great conspiracy in small amounts, everyone looks so pure and lovely.
This might also be why there are no particularly annoying characters in the full-time role.
The success of the full-time IP is largely due to this.
Setting aside the cultural phenomenon of online literature, Full-Time is indeed a good book.
How much he really can inspire people, touching them a little bit with his passion.
This April, the full-time job will be anime-themed.
Actually, I've wanted to buy this set of books for a long time, but I've always been held back by not having enough money. When I finally decided to buy them, I found that there were a lot of fakes on tb. Actually, a new version of the full-time job has recently been released. I quite like the cover, but I still plan to buy the old version first, so I looked on Amazon and bought a set all at once.
Next, let's briefly discuss the situation of the goods.
● The fourth book does not have a plastic wrap, but the book is new.
● The seventeenth book was sealed but has been opened, and the texture of the book feels strange, not as hard as the others.
The 23rd book is the same as the 17th book, but it is also harder than the 17th book, and it is very old.
The publishers of a few individual books are different. It seems like number 23 and 17 are from the same publisher, which is different from the others.
Overall, it's quite satisfactory. A big box of 24 books, very satisfying.
The Lonely Little Lion
When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as "The Lost Corner", but it turns out there's a lot of text!
I read it three times before I finished reading this book to the child, a little lion who can shoot guns, a little lion who loves to eat fruit juice gummies.
When seeing the scene where the lion eats the hunter, there is a slight discomfort. Modern urban people find it a bit hard to accept such a scenario where humans are eaten by animals.
In the end, this little lion, who had succeeded in human society, lost himself. He was no longer a complete lion, nor a complete human.
In the end, only the little lion's figure was seen from behind, not knowing where he had gone.
Perhaps many years later, the image of this little lion will still remain in the impressions of the grown-up children, being recalled on a certain day inadvertently, and it may touch or inspire them.
A portfolio with high cost-performance ratio
1. I didn't know about TASCHEN before, but recently I've bought quite a few of their books. The reason is that they are incredibly strong, both in terms of topic selection and production itself.
This work has been released in three versions. The largest version is similar to the complete works of Michelangelo, both are about 50 cm long and 34 cm wide. The medium version is approximately 36 cm long and 23 cm wide. This version is the smallest and comes with a two-volume book set in a box.
I personally find it acceptable. Firstly, it's affordable, and the over 700 pages are divided into two volumes, which makes it easier to read as a paperback. Secondly, unlike the complete works of Michelangelo, where the paintings are the main focus, this Da Vinci edition is mostly composed of black and white manuscripts. For readers with a limited budget and those who are not art majors, this edition offers the highest cost-performance ratio for appreciating paintings and manuscripts.
2. The commentary on the painting section is excellent, including composition analysis, draft analysis, and historical background (such as The Last Supper), but due to either printing or book size issues, some shadow parts are too dark to see the details clearly, which is a bit regrettable.
3. Compared to Michelangelo's manuscripts, Da Vinci's manuscripts are much more abundant in content.
The former is already a genius, while the latter, with his wide range of knowledge and high achievements, cannot be adequately described as just a genius.
If before you could only appreciate half of Da Vinci through his paintings, after seeing his manuscripts, you would be completely speechless.
Trash, whoever buys it will regret it!
I never give bad reviews, but this is genuinely rubbish. Buying it was a waste of money. Give me a reason!
1. The time is not accurate, it suddenly turned into January 1st, the time has been reset to zero.
2. Inferior quality belts, none of them are made of silicone, causing wrist allergies and blisters.
3. Often unable to connect to the mobile phone.
The battery life only lasts for five days.
5. Sleep detection is not displayed, the time is 0.
6. Not waterproof.
7. Others.
The logistics are too slow.
It was supposed to arrive on October 16th, but I didn't receive it until the 21st. Bad review!
The delivery service is terrible, buying things on Amazon is already slow, I didn't expect it to be this slow!
Overall satisfied
Initially, I was worried about the camera's packaging, but this time it was fine as it came with an air cushion bag. The camera's three codes matched and it could also be registered on the official website. The shutter count is at 0, and for the rest, only time will tell.
The delivery speed was quite fast. However, I have to complain about the courier. He just left the valuable item at the door and left quickly. I didn't have the chance to open and check the package in front of him, which left me speechless.
The merchant managed to consider the customer's needs before shipping :)
The merchant is quite responsible, specifically calling to ask about the screen size of the camera used, truly considering the customer's needs.
The delivery speed is also fast.
The diamond film fits quite well and is also effective.
The battery won't fully charge.
The machine is indeed good, but I want to ask why it can't be fully charged the first time. The charging indicator light is always red.
Currently, there is no official feedback channel for Amazon, so feedback can only be given in the product reviews.
1. On March 29, I pre-ordered this book for 31 yuan. It showed that it would be pushed to the device on March 31. At this time, the book could not be previewed on the official Amazon website (because it had not been released yet).
2. The book pushed to the device on March 31st was blank, with only a message saying "please look forward to it", while the electronic version of the book on Amazon was reduced to 18 yuan.
3. I have repeatedly tried to delete the blank books downloaded on the device and sync again over the past two days, but I still can't get the electronic version of "The Essence of Business" with actual content. However, I see that this book is already available for preview on the Amazon official website.
Currently, I have a few thoughts.
1. The issue of price is actually not the most important thing. The key is how to replace the blank books on Kindle with books that have actual content, instead of always downloading "coming soon" messages.
2. I probably won't buy pre-ordered books in the future, after all, if it gets delayed, downloading another book with no content seems very complicated.
3. I hope Amazon can provide a proper channel for feedback on such issues, where we can voice our concerns when we have doubts about downloading or using e-books (either through a ticket system or online customer service, you can refer to how Microsoft's official store does it).
Not highly recommended for reading.
I read this a long time ago and happened to come across it again. I'll write some thoughts from memory.
Rather than calling this book a collection of short stories, it's more accurate to say it's a collection of fragments about love from life.
The tone of this book is extremely plain, like that of plain water. The choice of words and sentence construction pursue simplicity to the extreme. The plot is also like a quiet and plain street on a summer afternoon.
Each short story is a snapshot of a small moment in ordinary life, with no beginning and no end.
Finally gathered together, titled "What We Talk About When We Talk About Love".
I think, this collection of novels, as well as its title, is like a form of performance art. What the author wants to express is that love is not just the joys and sorrows on the stage, the eternal commitment in urban legends, nor just the inseparable intimacy between you and me. Love is not only the above and should not be represented by the above. Love is also the mundane life as plain as water, the boring day after day, as well as the helplessness towards life, the escape from reality, and the confusion about the future.
While reading this book, you may recall the quarreling couple beside you, the bland marriages of people you know, and your own unsatisfactory relationships.
This is exactly why I don't recommend reading it. From an aesthetic perspective, the writing style and plot of this book are bland and tasteless. Unless your life is full of thrilling ups and downs or is as sweet as living in a candy castle, your reading experience would just feel mundane and boring.
From a depth of thought perspective, the everyday scenarios do not dazzle or expand one's thinking and vision (this is different from Marquez's "Love in the Time of Cholera"), and the brief segments do not explore any issues, such as what kind of mistakes lead to the failure of love?
What are the reasons for the breakdown of the protagonist's marriage?
Therefore, I do not recommend reading this book, as it doesn't hold much significance whether you read it or not.
The author's ideas are expressed more through techniques and genres rather than the story plot, which is also the reason why the reading experience of this book is relatively poor.
Suitable for skimming, not for detailed reading.
The logic of this book is very good, but the content is not rich enough.
It explains a lot about what and why of sales theories, but it is weak in terms of how to implement them. It only points out the direction but does not provide specific methods.
Additionally, this book feels like it's pieced together.
Examples include both domestic and foreign ones; both well-known entrepreneurs or salespeople and people who are not well-known.
I'm not sure if the stories were compiled just for the sake of giving examples, but it would be more convincing if the author provided some cases from their own experience.
Switching back and forth between referring to customers as "customers" or "clients".
The title refers to them as "customers," but in the body of the text, they become "clients."
The e-book also has issues with typos, missing punctuation marks, and incorrect numbering.
In summary, this book is a good choice for beginners in theory, but it is not very suitable for those who are already engaged in sales work and want to improve their sales level.
A Quick Guide to Understanding Internet Finance
This book is quite basic, it can be said to be just an introductory course, which can help everyone quickly understand the full picture of internet finance. However, to gain a deeper understanding, one still needs to follow the clues and dig deeper on their own.
The book was written quite early, and it does not mention the later subsidy wars between Alipay and WeChat to cultivate user habits. The current market share of third-party payments is probably much larger than what is mentioned in the book.
Nowadays, many people just bring their mobile phones when they go out to eat. Merchants have also abandoned UnionPay due to the high bank turnover.
Still, I am very grateful to the author for writing this introductory book. It is evident that the author has many years of experience in financial observation and is very familiar with the history of financial development both domestically and internationally. That's why they were able to write such easy-to-understand content.
Writing grandiloquently is easy, the challenge is to write in a way that is easy to understand.
I admire you, and I want you to know it even more!
The primary factor determining a person's job satisfaction is not the level of salary, but whether they receive enough attention and recognition in their work.
According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory, once a person's basic survival needs are met, the most urgent need is the satisfaction of psychological needs - the desire to be understood, affirmed, and appreciated.
Indeed, for most Chinese people, it's a case of "love is in the heart but hard to express". Even if they are filled with love, gratitude, and admiration, they tend to keep it to themselves and not voice it out.
The author elaborates on five languages of appreciation in this book: affirmative words, quality time, acts of service, heartfelt gifts, and physical touch.
I believe what's important is not just knowing what the five languages of appreciation are, but being able to genuinely use these five languages to appreciate and express gratitude to the people around you, whether they are family, friends, or colleagues, anytime and anywhere.
In fact, the closer we are to someone, the more we need to appreciate and be grateful to them, as this will make our lives even better.
By learning to appreciate, companies can also retain talent to a certain extent and reduce the resignation rate.
Thank you to the translator for bringing us wonderful foreign thoughts and perspectives of the world.
Due to differences in Eastern and Western cultural backgrounds and other factors, there will be more or less differences between languages. If there is a chance to see the author's original version, I believe more will be gained.
Once again, thank you to the author, translator, and editors for their hard work!
Suspected to be an inferior product, please Amazon conduct a strict review.
The quality is extremely poor, the packaging is loose, there is no weight, it's even worse than products from roadside stalls, there is no weight measurement, no barcode, and the ten-bag packaging is also loose. These are not the characteristics of a qualified product; this is the worst shopping experience on Amazon, and I have already applied for a return; this is entirely a quality issue; I suggest that the seller should open their eyes and refuse inferior goods; Addition: I bought another Hearttex, supermarket price is 23 yuan/10 rolls, I added a few comparison photos, which further verified the inferiority of this product, in order to provide consumers with a clearer reference, to avoid economic loss and further emotional distress!
Once again, we hope that Amazon can be meticulous and strictly control the source of its products.
The product is mediocre, and it does not meet expectations.
Advantages:
1. Big brands, low prices.
Advantage 2: Both the motor and blades are guaranteed by PANASONIC, and they work okay, but there is a gap between the performance and my expectations.
Disadvantages:
1. There is no charging indicator light, even the most basic power indicator is omitted. I guess for customers who purchase a 300 yuan product, in the eyes of Panasonic, it's like giving alms, with no respect at all.
2. There is a strong unpleasant smell. When charging, even if it's only for 10 minutes, you can smell a strong scent of burning plastic.
After using it in the office for one day, the whole room was filled with this plastic smell.
Compared to the Philips products of the same price range that I used before, although this Panasonic product has an extra cutter head, its quality is really disappointing for consumers.
Small package
Upon receiving the express delivery and seeing the words "E-commerce version" written on it, I knew I had been tricked again. It's much smaller than the ones sold in supermarkets, probably a size M. The packaging doesn't match the image shown in the product description, probably it's the so-called new version.
Three stars because I blame myself for not carefully checking the product specifications. I have no problem with you selling the M size e-commerce version, but what do you mean by delivering the wrong item?
E-commerce is tricky, if you have time, it's still better to go to the supermarket to buy things.
Just like that.
Don't like the taste
The child really dislikes the taste of toothpaste, always saying it's spicy. Perhaps a different word would be more appropriate to describe it, but for now, "spicy" is the only word in the child's vocabulary.
I bought it during a promotion, it was very cheap, so I feel bad giving a bad review. Four stars, but I won't buy it again.
Genuine product, well packaged.
The packaging is very complete, with an air bag added inside, it doesn't look like just a bare product as mentioned in the online reviews.
The bottle's outer packaging also has a layer of plastic film as described in the picture. The delivery was also very fast, it arrived the day after I placed the order.
It is genuine, but it's out of stock. I don't know when it will be restocked.
A frustrating shopping experience
I placed an order during Black Friday, but after waiting for a long time, I didn't receive it. Upon checking, I found out that the package had already been signed for. I asked my colleagues and none of them had signed for it. I quickly contacted the courier company, but they said only the sender could initiate an inquiry. I contacted Amazon customer service and waited for more than ten days. Finally, it was clarified that the package had been mistakenly delivered to someone else. After several rounds of back and forth, I finally retrieved the package. The outer packaging had been opened, but the product was still intact. I don't know if it has been used or not. Overall, it was a pretty frustrating experience.
Incorrect Illustration
I thought I would receive headphones like the ones in picture 1, but instead I received headphones like those in picture 2. I can overlook the discrepancy in the items, but what does it mean when the volume in the left and right earpieces is not the same?
Although the names are the same, I still hope everyone can be careful and pay attention. Additionally, I kindly request the person in charge at Amazon to promptly replace the images with the correct ones. Many thanks.
The operating system is average.
After using it for a while, overall the display is decent, and I don't notice much difference. However, the system is somewhat frustrating to use. The startup time is noticeably slow, and it's hard to make good settings. The pre-installed software doesn't even warrant a comment. The response speed is even more average. Compared to my colleague's, it's not even on the same level.
Looking at the reviews saying it has a very user-friendly design, I couldn't find where it was user-friendly. The design of the commonly used up, down, left, right, and back buttons on the remote control is really not commendable.
So, just use it as a TV, and also use things like a TV box.
The price drop is too drastic.
The price drop is too drastic, from over a hundred to now 99!
I have accumulated many unrated orders on Amazon, so I use a copied paragraph as the content for all reviews.
If I were to rate it with this comment, it means that this product scores at least 85 points or above.
For inferior products, I absolutely will not be lazy and copy-paste reviews. This way, other consumers can use it as a reference when purchasing, and the merchants will also improve the quality of their goods accordingly.
Good quality at a low price, this is enough if you're not a fanatic!
Such a cheap cable, but it should meet the HDMI certification standard. Comparing it personally, it easily outperforms domestic Akihabara's crap (the price is twice as expensive). The cable is thick and relatively soft, there is no noise in the 7-meter transmission. From now on, I will only choose Baseus for low-cost cables!
The product is okay, but Amazon's after-sales service is really much worse than other websites.
After placing the order, I realized I made a mistake, but I couldn't cancel the order. The webpage kept showing an error link when trying to contact online customer service, so I couldn't get in touch.
After the goods arrived, the deliveryman called me. I told him I didn't want it anymore and tried to cancel the order but was unsuccessful. The deliveryman took it back and told me to sign for it first, then apply for a return.
I was only informed that food items cannot be returned once they are signed for when I applied for a return. I tried calling Amazon customer service, but they said the same thing, that signed items cannot be returned.
I have previously purchased items from Jingdong and Suning that were non-refundable due to policy, including milk, diapers, etc. The customer service still accepted my returns. Even when I complained about the strong smell of the diapers from Jingdong after opening, the customer service still accepted the return. However, this is not possible with Amazon.
Rules are dead, people are alive, how does your customer service handle this?
Tell me, should I accept it myself or let the delivery person buy it? The delivery person's job is already hard enough, why should I make them pay for something they didn't purchase?
Fine, I won't return it, I'll keep it for myself, but I must give your service a score of 1.
Advise everyone not to waste money.
I bought this product with high expectations, thinking that the quality of the Duole brand wouldn't be too bad. When I received it, the packaging seemed fine and the size was decent. However, one box was mostly soft, which you couldn't tell from the outside, you had to feel it. When eaten, it had no taste at all, bland and flavorless. When bitten into, the fruit flesh was a dark yellow color, indicating that it was bad. They mixed good and bad ones together for sale, and less than a third were edible. I advise everyone not to buy this, it's not even cheap, the quality is too poor!
Once bitten, twice shy, I will never buy fruits from online stores again!
Where is the product anti-counterfeit label?
The bottom corner of the bottle is severely dented, which must have been caused by a strong impact. Judging from the outer packaging bag, the extent of the damage is distressing, especially since it is food packaging and it is too simple. Moreover, it is an international purchase, and there are no obvious anti-counterfeiting marks. Opening the bottle is very easy, but the key issue is that a layer of honey inside the cap came out directly from inside. There is almost no stickiness when opened. Is this how all foreign products are?
As someone born in China, I'm a bit confused.
It should be genuine, right?
Also, when I ordered, it indicated that it would arrive around the 20th, but I received it on the 14th. This is my first time shopping overseas here, I'm just writing down my doubts, maybe all of this is normal?
The delivery service needs improvement.
I bought a total of 5 pick-up vouchers. When I went to pick them up, I made an appointment to pick up 3 for the first time, but only 2 were sent. After multiple communications, it was confirmed that one was missed and promised to be reissued. The second time I made an appointment, it happened to be on a rest day. Both the website and WeChat did not indicate that appointments need to be made on working days, which caused unnecessary panic. I suggest improvements for the future.
Good shopping
Good reviews for the product!
I still trust the products sold directly by Amazon. Now, it's very convenient to shop overseas. The logistics time for buying from abroad is only a few days longer than domestic purchases. I have to say that Amazon's ability to clear customs from overseas to domestic is very strong, much faster than transshipment. So now, I buy a lot of things on overseas shopping platforms.
I hope the quality and price of domestic products can be improved. Many things are produced domestically, but it's cheaper to buy them after they've been exported and re-imported. I hope for improvements.
Garbage
Seeing such a package, I ask everyone: Don't you think it looks like roadside trash?
Is it responsible to send a fragile plastic package from so-called Germany in a plastic bag?
I feel like this packaging is as if it's for garbage. Buying this product, the packaging is extremely crude, without any measures to prevent damage. It's just a simple plastic bag packaging. After receiving it, the package was completely deformed, and the items inside were also damaged.
If I just encountered one like this, I would accept it, but I bought several and they were all like this. I contacted Amazon customer service, and they said I could return them, but I would have to cover the shipping costs, which would then be refunded to me in the form of a gift card.
Let me ask, if I pay the shipping fee in cash, and you give me a gift card in return, are you implying that I should buy your gift cards directly? Moreover, I have to mail the product to a warehouse in Germany myself. Isn't this making purchasing a product a hassle!
I have been asking the customer service who is responsible for this issue, but they didn't admit it's their responsibility, not even a word. They don't dare to take responsibility. What kind of guarantee does this after-sales service provide? In one word: admit defeat! But I guess my review won't be given a chance to be published by Amazon, it will be directly deleted!
The quality is very good, 5 stars, but the logistics are very poor.
1, The quality is very good, it's a flash sale item, the price is moderate, and it's worth more than it costs.
2, Sturdy, made with sufficient materials, solid welding points, properly treated surface, and good color.
3, the logistics is a major issue, the order placed on the 3rd arrived on the 11th.
4, If Amazon hadn't marked the estimated arrival time as February 7th, I might have been very satisfied.
5. However, marking the expected arrival time is equivalent to making a promise to the user. When the promise cannot be fulfilled, the user feels very upset.
6, If you are not sure you can keep a promise, please do not make one.
7, In fact, I care a lot about the promises made by the merchant.
8, therefore, I gave a low score.
The gold thread will fade in color.
The effects are there, but whether they are noticeable depends on the individual, or it could be a placebo effect.
One downside is the golden thread. It was originally designed to look good, but in reality, this gold thread fades in color. If you move it around a few times in the car, there will be some gold dust on your hands and in the car.
Hope the product can be improved.
This square one doesn't have much decorative effect, so don't put gold threads on it. It would be troublesome if they fall off and dirty the car.
The items are in good condition, the speed is acceptable, and they are divided into two packages with different packaging.
The delivery was quite fast, taking only 8 days. However, the two items were split into two different packages, and the packaging was not the same. One was obviously over-protected with thick cardboard attached and a layer of plastic wrap. The outer packaging was also easy to open. The other one was like a domestic express box, with just a few air cushions for padding, which felt a bit perfunctory.
The Yalan mattress is really good.
A 34cm mattress is not ordinarily thick, you can even sleep directly on the mattress without a bed.
The quality is very good, both the front and the back are quite soft, sleeping is very comfortable, and you can fall asleep quickly when lying on it.
After receiving the mattress, there were some stains in two places due to the violent delivery by the courier. The Yalan customer service was very responsible and efficiently contacted to resolve the issue.
It's not a self-operated product, Amazon is shameless.
The page clearly marks it as self-operated, but in reality, it is delivered by the supplier, the after-sales service is handled by the supplier, and if there are any issues, you need to contact the supplier directly.
If you want to cancel the order, I'm sorry, the order information has already been passed to the supplier and cannot be cancelled. If you want to return or exchange goods, even though you have successfully applied for a return or exchange on Amazon, I'm sorry, no one will handle your request, you need to contact the supplier for the return yourself.
What the hell kind of self-operated merchandise is this?
The product is not distributed by Amazon, and Amazon does not take responsibility for after-sales service. The customer service even said, "I will help you contact the supplier," and claimed that it is self-operated. This is utterly shameless, a blatant disregard for decency, and a naked fraud against consumers!
Frustrating experience
The filter cartridge I previously purchased from another online store had a good filtration effect. Even after 28 days, using it for an extra day or two did not result in any water scale.
Since the quality of the items I've always bought on Amazon has been good, I thought I'd buy from here this time. This is the first time I've bought a filter cartridge on Amazon, and it's not very good. Not only did it start to have scale early on, but the filter cartridge also had floating small black carbon powder until the 28th day. I really don't know whether to continue using it or just throw it away. It's very frustrating.
Not as good as imagined.
Compared to the power strips I've used in the past, the exterior workmanship is average. I haven't opened it to see the inside, but I hope it's as the seller described. From the perspective of ease of use, it lacks an indicator to show whether each individual unit is powered.
The packaging is damaged, waiting for time to test the product quality.
The outer packaging is severely damaged, but the inner box seems to be new. However, the instruction manual does not appear to be new. I just renovated in September and am stocking up. I hope the product won't be damaged by then. Could Amazon please explain why several customers have mentioned damaged packaging, yet you seem to be handling it calmly? Thank you!
Overall not bad, there are some minor issues.
This is my first time buying a water filter jug. After reading several review articles, I felt that LAICA's cost-performance ratio was higher, so I chose this one. After receiving the goods, I installed the filter according to the instructions and tried it out. Overall, it feels good. However, it seems that the raw water will mix with the treated water from the spout of the jug (the raw water compartment is not very tightly sealed).
When using, make sure to wait until all the water has been filtered before pouring it out!
The picture is incomplete.
The photo does not capture the details of the side, and the style of the side details is not consistent with the main body, there is a big difference, this is the first point; this bead is produced in Thailand, but the place of production is not marked, this is the second point; the texture is not marked, this is the third point; when I bought it in the UK, each item clearly had its own box, but here there is only a simple plastic bag, and there is no product logo on the bead, I can't judge whether it is real or fake.
Be careful when making purchases, especially when buying items from Hong Kong.
Amazon's customer service is really terrible.
The order I placed two days ago has dropped by 40 yuan today. I spent a lot of time finding customer service, and they said they couldn't make up the price difference, but I could repurchase and return the original item.
This customer experience and service is ten thousand times worse than that of certain treasure and certain east (referring to popular Chinese e-commerce platforms, Taobao and JD.com).
Not bad, it's worth getting for beginners.
The quality is passable, but it can't compare to the top-notch Transformers. I've seen the price in the mall before, it's at least several hundred. This is my first time playing with Transformers, it's not bad.
The stuff is not bad.
The item is really good, it's a gift for my girlfriend. However, I had some unpleasant experience when I wasn't home at noon for the delivery. The logistics company directly put it in the parcel locker and didn't send me a pickup verification message, causing me to make two trips.
But the treasure is indeed good.
Worth buying
The little monkey is cute, Amazon offers great discounts, Chow Sang Sang's official website ships directly. I placed an order the night before yesterday, and received it this afternoon. That was really fast.
The postal courier is also very responsible.
Awesome!
A Customer's Confession
1. Upon receiving such defective goods, Amazon customer service tells you not to worry, they will contact you within approximately 54 hours.
2. Then, if you contact the customer service staff in the middle, they will tell you that a specialist will handle this issue and they will inform you of the result.
You can never actively reach this officer, nor do you know her employee number, nor do you have a direct contact number. You simply cannot reach her; she can only contact you.
The tragic thing is that after waiting for nearly 3 days, this commissioner contacted me. I was away from my phone for a while and missed the call from this commissioner.
I waited for 2 hours but did not receive a call from the commissioner. During this time, I proactively contacted Amazon customer service and sent an email asking them to call me back.
It's been nearly 3 days and I still don't know how Amazon will handle the defective coffee machine I received!
The products from Amazon US are fine, and overseas shopping is a good method, but the service is far inferior compared to Amazon US.
For me, I can only continue to wait...
Uneven Bottom
Because the reviews were all very good, I had high expectations for this pot. I liked it when I first got it, it was very light and handy. However, I found a problem when I started to use it. The bottom of the pot is not flat, it bulges in the middle and dips around the edges, causing all the oil to run to the sides. The large fatty meat I specifically bought to season the pot produced a lot of oil, but it couldn't cover the central area and got burnt. I couldn't even season the pot properly. I guess with this kind of design, it's impossible to cook normally.
I don't know if I'm just unlucky, but I happened to get a pot with an uneven bottom. Thankfully, Amazon offers a one-month return service, so I decisively returned it.
I cleaned the pot thoroughly and returned it, having wasted half a day for nothing.
Good product design requires matching manufacturing processes to achieve.
This is a product with a very simple and clean design style.
The designer has shaped the cube with a slight curvature at the top.
The lines should have been very smooth originally.
Unfortunately, the final effect was not achieved.
Because there are two components at the top, the front is the control panel, and the back is the water box cover.
The curvature of the top cover and the control panel surprisingly do not match, resulting in a height difference of about 2mm after assembly.
Although it appears to be a very small gap.
But it can be said that it completely destroyed the entire sense of design.
I feel a bit sorry for that product designer.
It seems that Midea's product manager does not yet have the ability to create products of this standard.
(Of course, one cannot expect too much from the feedback of the after-sales lady. However, when I heard her say that all units of this product are like this, and it's not just the one I bought that has a problem, her indifference and heavy burden of truth made me realize that I can't expect too much from beauty either) On July 7, 2019, the water pump malfunctioned and the water output was low. This is the second time it has been repaired, and it broke again two weeks after the first repair.
It's very cost-effective after the discount, but Amazon's fake discounts are disappointing.
Purchased one week after the baby's birth, it has excellent heat retention.
The outside of the pot does not feel hot at all, so there is no fear of scalding and it effectively prevents the heat from dissipating.
After a night, the air-conditioned room can still maintain a high temperature.
Amazon announced a big discount for its anniversary event at 320, but later found out that everyone had 249, 289, 299, which instantly gave a feeling of being deceived. However, after comparing with the supermarket, it is still much more cost-effective than various off-brands at the same price. In the future, it can be carried with the car when going out.
Vitamix 6300
I've been watching for a long time, and when I saw that the price on Amazon US was reduced to 6300, and Amazon China overseas purchase was the same price, I quickly made a purchase.
I placed an order on September 2nd, with an estimated arrival date of the 21st. However, it arrived on the 12th, almost 10 days early. The speed was really fast!
The packaging box is not big, it uses the original packaging of Vitamix directly. Amazon is not afraid of it getting damaged from overseas shipping!
The machine looks quite new and comes with all the accessories. The only issue is that the cup shakes a lot when placed on the base. I'm afraid it might fly off when I turn on the machine!
I asked a friend who has 5200, and from his description, it seems like his is not as loose as mine.
The randomly included recipe is all in English, which is quite tiring to read. I couldn't find a Chinese version online either, which is a hassle!
After receiving the goods, I quickly bought a transformer. I guess it will arrive in about 3 days, and I'll tinker with it then!
Too small, no umbrella cover, average material quality.
It's not large size at all!
Second Totes umbrella, 1. This one does not come with an umbrella cover 2. The handle material is average 3. It is clearly labeled as Large, but in reality, it is a convenient umbrella for one person, it might be a bit tight for two people to use.
On the contrary, the one I bought from Amazon before can be used by three people without any pressure.
Not feeling very well
Firstly, the box is not very sturdy, it deforms with a little pressure. Secondly, the design on the back to prevent the ABS surface of the box from being scratched when placed flat does not work. Thirdly, inside the box, there is just a piece of cloth wrapped around, and the place where the pull rod protrudes... and so on, there are various dissatisfactions. Lastly, the zipper is not very smooth.
PS: The wheels do indeed feel pretty good.
Acceptable/Okay
Advantages: This backpack is quite delicate and appears to be durable.
Cons: The QR code on the card cannot be scanned (what's going on?), a 15.6-inch laptop does not fit (can it be a bit longer?), this backpack's zipper can be locked, but they do not provide a lock for the buyer, which can hardly be called top-notch service.
Overall it's okay, not sure if it's genuine leather.
The overall feeling is okay, I'm not sure if it's genuine leather, so I can't blindly comment.
It can hold A4 size documents, and has held up to 80 pages thick, but it probably can't hold box-shaped objects that are too thick or too hard (and can't be deformed).
The bag is very soft, the inner compartments are also quite user-friendly, overall it's pretty good.
Just that the bottom of the item I received has a small sand hole. I don't know if it's because of my bad luck or what?
Too lazy to go through the hassle of returning and exchanging goods, so I just put up with it.
Overall, it's worth four stars.
ForRoyal Popular Worldwide Camera Strap, SLR Strap
This strap is designed scientifically, it can be hung on both shoulders, and is practical. Moreover, the front part uses soft material to secure and protect the camera, unlike other quick shooters that use screws to fix the bottom, which can damage the camera. Moreover, it is also very convenient to take off for photography.
Poor after-sales service
I bought a piano one and a half months ago and it was missing a part. After notifying Amazon, they gave me the after-sales service number. Despite multiple communications, I still haven't received the part. What kind of efficiency is this!
It is estimated that it will be more troublesome to repair if there are problems later. Friends who are looking forward to good after-sales service should take a detour, it's too much trouble!
Has minor flaws, but the sound quality is good.
The head of the piano has a defect, missing a corner, it feels like a substandard product, and there are no gifts included. However, for this price, it's already not bad, and the sound of the piano is also good.
Not bad, the first delivery note.
I've been using it for a long time, apart from the bass not coming out, overall it's not bad.
The work is not as perfect as imagined.
The first time I bought it, there was a problem with the item. All the lights were flickering and it couldn't be used.
Requested for an exchange, but even though the goods have arrived in Shanghai for three days, they still haven't been delivered.
They don't answer the phone when called for delivery.
The courier company said that they only have that contact method.
Amazon can't find the place to file a complaint.
In the absence of any request, a message came in inexplicably delaying the delivery according to my request - in the case of delayed delivery.
What was mentioned about the transfer issue afterwards?
An extremely poor shopping experience, starting to doubt the effectiveness of Amazon's logistics and control systems.
I guess I won't get it today either.
The label's adhesiveness is too poor, it's not waterproof.
Although the Bluetooth connection is very convenient, the printed content is not waterproof, and there is no film on the surface; moreover, the label's adhesiveness is very poor, it is not suitable for cable labels at all, they fall off very easily. Friends who buy it for cable management need to be aware of this.
The pen is okay, but the packaging is too simple. It's just a cardboard box with no protective measures. Moreover, the box for the pen is sealed with a large piece of transparent tape. When torn off, the tape remains on the box.
Treating a 600 yuan item like this, it's a very disappointing shopping experience.
But there is no problem with the pen.
Hope for more improvements in packaging in the future!
The quality is unquestionable, but in terms of writing, it's not as good as the 925-25.
Firstly, praise for Tiantian Express, the air freight is super fast, and the service attitude is also very good!
I have been using the 925-25, which is excellent. I just received the 925-85, the quality of the pen is unquestionable, and the style is also very beautiful. The reason I gave it four stars is because the pen is a bit heavy, not suitable for fast writing, and the cap adjustment for the lead length is a bit shaky. Personal opinion: the 925-25 is more handy than the 85.
Therefore, became a die-hard fan of Amazon.
I bought it at a super discounted price, but it turns out my child doesn't like the reading pen.
The item has been opened, I tried to apply for a return, and they surprisingly offered free home pick-up.
Awesome.
Returns are not encouraged, but such a service is unique in China.
Hope it will not be abused.
From now on, all books will be purchased from here.
The headphones have a bias in sound, and there is also noise.
This headset is really garbage, I don't know if it's my ears that have a problem, or if this headset is indeed not as good as before.
I bought a blue one from a certain easy purchase platform two years ago. The sound quality was pretty good, with no noise and decent bass. After using it for more than two years and it broke, I plan to buy another one (urbeats), after all, I feel it's pretty good.
I saw a nice-looking purple one and ended up buying it. But when I opened it today and listened to it, something felt off - one side was louder than the other.
At first, I thought it was due to the sound effects of that song and didn't think much of it. But after listening for a while, I realized that this problem is quite serious. Not only is the sound off, but the bass effect is also not as good as before, and there is some noise. Is it just the purple one I bought that has this issue? Or is it that the current headphone manufacturing process is really not up to par?
Quite a poor review, very disappointing.
You must return the goods during the day tomorrow.
The aesthetics of Photoshop are pretty good.
This AV amplifier model has a complex setup, a rough exterior finish, and generates a large amount of heat.
The sound quality should be evaluated after a period of use!
Just got the German version of DN1080 on August 14th. The exterior workmanship is so poor.
1. The front panel and knobs are all made of plastic.
2. The audio input jack on the back panel and the speaker output terminals are very poor. Any CD amplifier combo unit ranging from 1000-2000 is much better than this model.
3. The top cover is quite thin, and it has even caved in on the side of my transformer. I had no choice but to open the box and manually restore it. The top cover and the front panel are loosely connected.
4. The center of gravity of the entire machine is biased towards the transformer end, making it awkward to move.
It feels like an entry-level SONY device, with that kind of craftsmanship, made in Malaysia.
I feel that Sony outsourcing in China is much better than Xiaomi.
5. The machine generates a lot of heat. After using it for about two hours to watch a movie with two sound channels, the top cover feels about 40-50℃ when touched by hand. I'm not sure if it's because the transformer is too large and generates a lot of heat.
Nowadays, switch power supplies are commonly used, and this big, silly transformer probably weighs about 4KG.
Sony should use active cooling silent fans inside the machine. After unboxing, only large aluminum heat sinks on the pipes were seen.

Never been opened before
The battery is in use.
I really want to dissect it and see what's inside its stomach.
Upon reflection, I thought that if I were to be disappointed after opening it, it would be a waste of so much money; and if I were satisfied after opening it, it would be difficult to put it back together, which would make using it less enjoyable.
Forget it, let's just assume that Sony uses good batteries.
As for the detailed explanation of battery capacity, ordinary people would generally feel overwhelmed.
I'm doing fine. I've worked in a mobile phone factory for a long time. Apart from not understanding circuits, I can be considered half a battery engineer. I can handle it.
Overjoyed beyond expectations
I really had no idea before buying, but as soon as I opened it and saw the packaging, it felt great!
Finally, when I touched the headphone wire, it felt exceptionally flexible, the quality was too good, I couldn't wait to plug it into my phone and open QQ Music.
I was astonished, the sound quality is actually 3D surround sound!
I asked at the physical communication store, it's about 30, but definitely not the Pisen brand, it's a miscellaneous brand. Therefore, even though this Pisen model is 27, its cost performance is absolutely worth owning!
The worst online shopping experience
After placing an order on September 28, the system showed that it had been shipped, but I still hadn't received the goods by October 12.
Inquiring about the status of an Amazon order, the seller did not provide a tracking number, so I can't find where the order is.
So I sent an email to the seller asking if they could provide the tracking number, but there was no reply after two days.
Out of desperation, I contacted Amazon's customer service, who provided me with the seller's phone number. After calling the store a few times, I finally got through and was informed that the package had been lost in delivery. They assured me that they could immediately send me a replacement.
Although I was particularly angry, due to the urgent need for the computer, I didn't say much to the seller, as long as they sent it to me immediately.
As a result, I called the next day to ask, has it been shipped?
The seller said it's not ready yet, it can only be sent in the afternoon.
I called again in the afternoon, and the seller assured me that the goods would be dispatched after five or six in the afternoon. However, when I called at seven in the evening, no one answered the phone.
On the morning of the third day, I called again, asking if the goods had been shipped out?
Can you tell me the order number?
The seller said they haven't shipped it yet, and told me if I'm in a hurry, I should order from another store. If I can wait, they will ship it in the afternoon.
There's no choice, ordering from another place would take a long time.
I can only urge the seller to ship the goods as soon as possible.
Finally, after countless phone follow-ups, I received the computer on October 16th.
As for the quality of the computer, I don't know because it was purchased for someone else. I will add more comments later.
I just bought it half a year ago and haven't used it much, but it's already malfunctioning. Can I ask for it to be repaired?
Because I have a desktop computer, I didn't use it much after I bought it.
Just pack it in the suitcase for use a few times when on a business trip.
Recently, I found that when the power is connected, it does not charge. I need to manually adjust the connection between the charger and the wire a few times before it can start charging.
I suspect that there is a poor contact at the interface, I wonder if it can still be repaired now?
Strongly suggest Amazon to stop using EMS!
Five stars for the product, one star for logistics, averaging three stars.
I don't understand why Amazon would choose to ship with EMS, which is widely recognized in the industry as unreliable. After all, a computer is a valuable item!
After purchasing, the order showed that it was expected to be delivered on the 20th, so my family waited at home for three days!
Why does it take four to five days to send something from Xiamen to Fuzhou?
On the morning of the 22nd, I finally saw that the logistics had arrived in Fuzhou, and I was ready to happily receive the goods. However, in the evening, without receiving any calls or text messages, I checked the logistics and found out that it had been signed for at noon, and it even showed that I personally signed for it!
I was shocked in an instant!
Who am I? Where am I? Did I really buy this computer?
I'm seriously doubting life, okay?!
Finally, I had to make a trip to the collection point to bring the computer back.
The specific reason, simply put, is because the delivery guy mixed up the two tracking numbers. Fortunately, the package wasn't lost so it's all good.
I strongly suggest that Amazon should stop using EMS. If Amazon continues to use EMS for delivery in the future, I will definitely not make any more purchases.
The goods are not bad.
First of all, I must say that I was disappointed to find out that the price dropped just a few days after I bought it. However, the product itself is quite good, with high cost performance. The CPU and graphics card are sufficient to handle mainstream online games and a considerable portion of large-scale single-player games. The cooling system is excellent, but the screen has a bit of light leakage (a common problem with IPS screens). The sound quality is not very good, and the hard drive is not good either (I suggest spending a bit more money to add a solid-state drive). I took it to after-sales service for a hardware check yesterday, and there were no problems. The pre-installed Windows 8.1 is not very user-friendly, I suggest upgrading to Windows 10. The seller shipped quickly and responded to all inquiries promptly. I received the invoice the day after I received the computer, which was good. Unfortunately, there were no free gifts included.
(By the way, I must mention that you should definitely not buy keyboard films from a store called E Cool Digital Center on a certain treasure site. The delivery is slow, the quality is poor, and they do not accept returns or exchanges for problematic products. Moreover, the boss is always using foul language. I just wanted to expose this.)
The goods are good, but the platform bureaucracy remains.
The hard drive quality is excellent, and the cost performance is absolutely high. It's even cheaper than buying in Hong Kong. If you're not in a hurry to use it and can tolerate the logistics, I definitely recommend purchasing it.
However, it must be said that the bureaucracy of the Amazon platform remains the same as it was a few years ago when I swore never to use it again. You can never check the actual logistics status, the information is always that it will be delivered a few weeks later, and you can never file a complaint. It's just so bureaucratic!
I received the goods a few days ago, but the logistics information still says that you will receive the goods in about 10 days!
Logistics is not worry-free
The item was delivered in this condition, not only was the packaging crushed, but the electronic packaging was also opened. I don't even know if anything was swapped out.
For Your Information
Haven't tried it yet, always trust Philips, hope the battery life is longer than other brands.
I looked it up online, it might be a common problem with water ingress, and there is no warranty.
Depressed!
Now that it's wrapped in cling film and continues to be used, I wonder how long it can last?
Bought something that has been opened by others
The tax of over a hundred on a machine of over three hundred is indeed quite high, but seeing it now at over six hundred makes me feel much more balanced.
When I received it, the condition of the sealing tape looked very wrong, as if it had been opened before. I quickly took a photo, and sure enough, it opened as soon as I tore it. After opening, the cardboard inside was also damaged. I was worried that it was returned by someone else. I hurriedly tried it on my husband before the anniversary, but the machine had no power at all. Thankfully, there were no stubble in the blade, otherwise, how would I return it from such a long distance!
Whether it is good to use or if there will be any problems in the short term is still unknown. As mentioned in the previous reviews, the items sent out when out of stock are indeed unreliable!
Above average in terms of experience.
It's almost top-of-the-line in electric toothbrushes, with many different teeth cleaning modes. However, very few people would switch modes every day.
I've been using it for half a year without any problems, using it daily. I charge it about once a week.
The brush head accessories are just as cheap on Amazon.
The app is a bit difficult to use. Apart from changing the colors and such, it seems that other compatibility issues are due to the overseas version?
Hope to learn the Great Law.
High cost-performance ratio
It has already been used 3-4 times.
1. The packaging is intact.
2. It is very easy to use and also convenient to clean.
3. You can totally DIY your haircut, which saves money.
In conclusion, it was a very successful purchase.
There are counterfeit goods.
Last time I bought two packs, surprisingly they were two different versions. Originally, the text in the lower left corner of the package was green, but one of the packs was not, it had white text. As a result, my cat had diarrhea after eating it.
I can't determine whether the goods from Amazon are fake, or if they were switched by the staff during delivery.
I will buy it again, but if it's still counterfeit, I will hold your relevant personnel accountable.
It's a hyphen!
The picture on Amazon showed a slash, but what they sent me was a dash. Isn't this deception?
The effect is acceptable.
The cat likes to eat, this is the key point.
It indeed has an effect.
Tight, narrow, binding feet, rubbing the back of the feet.
Not recommended.
1. UN is the most comfortable series of Clarks, but unfortunately, this model is too bad.
Addendum: Today I compared the current UN series shoe insoles with the ones from the past (I threw away the shoes but kept the insoles for use). The material quality has declined significantly, the elasticity is not as good as before, and the breathability is also not as good as before. They just feel falsely soft.
2. The top of my foot is not very high, and the part that feels hard is about 3 centimeters forward from the highest point of the top of my foot.
3. Bought three pairs of Clarks overseas, only one pair fits.
I was so scared that I deleted all the games from my collection.
Try Rockport again, if it doesn't work, you'll have to go to the Ecco physical store.
Substituting inferior for good, poor quality control.
Firstly, it's worth acknowledging that Prime's overseas shopping delivery is very efficient. I placed an order on the 31st and received it on the 6th.
The color of the shoes looks much better than in the picture, and the leather feels good.
The shoe size is slightly larger. I ordered a 7.5W for a foot length of 25 and a width of 10.5. It's a bit loose when worn, but I usually prefer a looser fit. It fits perfectly with a pair of insoles.
Next, the quality control of this shoe is really not commendable. One shoe sole is damaged, the other shoe surface has various scratches and a pinhole. The glue strip at the connection between the shoe surface and the shoe sole is misplaced. It's obviously a case of passing off inferior products as good ones!
Feeling a bit regretful!
I bought it for 280 yuan during a sale, which is a great deal for Asics. Of course, according to the reviews, there are even lower prices.
Now let's talk about the shoes. Advantages: The shoes are very light, comfortable for running, and fit well, they won't be loose and sloppy.
The shoes are very attractive but the flaws are also quite obvious: I usually wear size 40, but this time I bought size 40.5. There is about a thumb's width of space at the front of the shoe, but this doesn't really affect anything.
This shoe is very "narrow". Even though there is still some space in the front, it feels tight.
Another point is that the shoes might not be very breathable, as my feet feel very hot when I wear them now.
Pressing the top of the foot
Firstly, the shoes are well-made, worth the price.
My feet are of a standard size, with running shoes at UK7.5, EU41.5, and leather shoes at UK6.5. I have bought several pairs from Amazon's Aibu, and they have never been ill-fitting. However, for this pair, I bought a size larger (UK7) based on the reviews. After trying them on, they were obviously too long because they were one size larger. But because the insoles were too thick, they still pressed hard on the top of my feet. Combined with the fact that the walking shoes were very stiff, they were very uncomfortable to wear.
If your feet are not particularly slim, it is not recommended to purchase this model.
If you must buy, changing the insole can solve the problem, but the original insole looks very high-end, it would be a pity not to use it.
A very perfect shopping experience!
Very satisfied, very fond of it, Amazon overseas purchases are undoubtedly genuine, the quality is also very good, good value for money, rest assured to buy, after-sales service is very thoughtful, customer service attitude is very friendly and kind, handling problems patiently and efficiently, perfectly solving any worries, the accompanying express delivery to the door is very convenient and secure, the delivery person always thinks of the customers, always reminding to pick up from the express cabinet in time, thank you Amazon for providing such a comfortable shopping experience for customers.
In short, our whole family loves shopping on Amazon Overseas!
Absolutely negative review!
I'm really speechless about this agency and Amazon.
You should still be careful when buying electronic products on Amazon in the future.
Although it's been a long time, I still need to vent.
I bought it during a winter flash sale for less than 200, and it has been sitting at home unused for several months.
I found that I couldn't connect to the wristband in spring, even though both devices' manuals indicated they were compatible. Later, I realized that the problem should be with the heart rate band, because it still couldn't connect with other devices.
I called Amazon, and they told me to contact the agency. The agency then asked me to send the device to Shanghai for inspection at my own expense.
After nearly half a month, the items were returned to me exactly as I had sent them, even the express delivery box was the one I used to send them!
There are no replies, acknowledgments, or inspection reports!
At least tell me, whether it's good or bad!
I called to ask, they said if it's sent back like this, it means the device has no problem, it's good.
"But why can't I still connect?" I asked. The proxy company replied: "That's not our problem anymore."
Consider me unlucky, I can't be bothered to be hassled by you guys over a 200 yuan item.
Serious mismatch of goods.
Extremely mismatched.
The material of the headband is very good.
Much better than Nike.
The breathability is also very good.
Just the hat in front.
Very thin.
Are you here to tease or make fun of me?!
The sunlight cannot be completely blocked.
The reason for not returning the product is because the headband function is quite good.
Although wearing it upwards does not block the sun.
However, it is different from other headband styles.
Keep it for use.
The product quality is good, but Amazon lacks a spirit of commitment. The delivery person is very good.
I request delivery on Saturdays and Sundays!
Amazon's policy does not allow deliveries on Saturdays and Sundays.
I had to drive 200 kilometers back from out of town to pick up the goods because of you!
Amazon, how can I love you again?
The delivery person is very proactive and enthusiastic.
Give a like!
The product, after a simple test, is not bad.
But I have never bought similar products before, so I can't compare prices!
Size Logistics
The workmanship is acceptable, but the logistics are too slow. Previously, all shoes were delivered by DHL, but this time with Apex, it's really... I've bought a lot of UA domestically, and the prices are not low. Does it feel like they're positioning themselves higher than NIKE and ADIDAS?
Actually, they are all good, so let's go for overseas online shopping.
Size: I am 176CM tall and weigh 68KG. I usually wear size 180 for my shoulder width. I bought size M, the hem is slightly long, but the rest fits well. I see some recommend size S, are they so slim? Or do they prefer tight-fitting? I think hoodies should be a bit loose.
The size is just right.
Chest circumference 99, height 184, weight 84 kilograms, I consulted the customer service before purchasing and was told to buy XXL. However, after reading the reviews, I decisively chose L. After receiving it, I found that the size was just right. I almost got tricked.
The prices on Singles Day are much higher than on Black Friday.
The quality of the clothes is very good.
The issue with cost-effective products is very troublesome!
The order was placed on the 18th, but the goods were not received until the 25th, the delivery speed from Guangzhou to Beijing was as slow as a snail!
I bought a cost-effective product from Z. The description mentioned scratches, but after receiving the goods, I found that 4 screws and nuts were missing!
The child didn't want to return the item, thinking the problem wasn't significant, but for such small parts like accessories, the child's grandfather couldn't find them in several nearby hardware stores!
In the end, grandpa stuck it on!
It seems that I can't buy cost-effective products from Z in the future!
The quality of toy processing is not good.
Most of the bolt holes are not aligned, making it very difficult to screw in the bolts. This clearly indicates poor manufacturing quality. I'm not sure how long it can be used for. Since it's something promised to my child, I won't return it.
In other reviews, they said the installation was not difficult. Am I the only one having problems with the item I bought?
Very average
Could it be that I'm just unlucky?
The packaging is so old it's unbearable; the craftsmanship is very average; there is only one type of music and it's only 8 seconds long, then it repeats continuously; the only action is shaking its head and moving forward, with no variation.
Not worth this price.
In urgent need, so will not return the goods.
The quality of the toy is pretty good, but I have to complain about the packaging.
I received a package yesterday, which I bought from Amazon. It was marked as shipped by EMS, but in the end, it was delivered by Tmall's courier service. How many turns did it take? Are Amazon and Tmall on good terms?
Speaking of the packaging, it was just wrapped in several layers of cling film, without even a piece of bubble wrap inside. Upon opening, all the parts were just placed in the empty box. Thankfully, the quality of the toy is good and no parts were broken. However, it is much smaller than expected. Since it doesn't come with batteries, it often derails when pushed by hand. It feels like the gap on both sides of the track is too large, indicating an unreasonable design.
Good quality, fun to play.
Very fun, the components are of high precision, finely crafted, and the quality is almost comparable to Lego. The price is very favorable during promotions.
The assembly process is quite interesting. I do the assembling, and my 5-year-old son plays with it. It's pretty good.
He had so much fun that he kept laughing out loud. He will probably continue to buy toys from this brand in the future.
The machine is new, overseas shopping is not bad.
I checked during Christmas, the item I bought before was 150 yuan more expensive, but the current delivery is a bit slower.
The machine is pretty good, all quite new.
Built-in Pikachu.
Then, if you connect the Pokeball, you will receive a Dream Ball.
It's pretty fun to play, with higher portability than the PS4.
I've already bought Zelda, waiting for the game now, will try it out later.
Producing shoddy goods, selling shoddy goods, and providing shoddy service. I bought six watches to give to my children, one of which has an incomplete digital display. The time on all six watches is inconsistent, varying by several hours.
I contacted the manufacturer to ask if there was a verification time when the watches were put into storage. They replied "yes". Since there is, why is there such a big difference in time? It must be that the watches are not accurate, simply put, they are inferior products. It's not that I'm being harsh, but look, they are selling products with obvious quality issues (the digital display is incomplete). Are these not junk goods?
I contacted the seller, and the seller gave a bunch of reasons, even complaining that I shouldn't have bought their product in the first place. With such a product, such a seller, and such after-sales service, who would dare to buy anything on Amazon in the future?
In conclusion, I suggest not buying anything from this seller, as what you get is just junk.
Amazon Shipping Issue
After receiving the goods, it was found that:
1. The packaging of the table is severely worn out.
2. The manual has serious usage creases.
3. The clock is not working, the desk lamp cannot be used for charging, and the time cannot be adjusted.
4. Contacted Amazon customer service separately, can only send it to the United States at my own expense, and then reimburse the postage.
5. The reason for the 2 points is that the customer service is not bad.
Can only say it's passable.
The time is not very accurate, it's about a second faster every day. After only a few months, it's already more than two minutes ahead.
I used a Citizen watch before, and it didn't lose more than a few seconds over a year or two.
The perpetual calendar function is quite good, but the timer function is somewhat useless, basically not needed, and occasionally it will accidentally enter the timer mode.
Solar Powered Sports Watch
Advantages: Solar charging eliminates the worry of battery replacement, it features world time, multiple alarms, and hourly reminders.
Cons: The mirror surface is easily scratched and dust can get in.
Cost-effectiveness: The general domestic price ranges from 220-300, while the overseas purchase price is over 180 (takes about 1 week to deliver).
A very satisfactory watch
It's definitely genuine, I've had it checked at the official counter. The appearance of the watch is very beautiful, the craftsmanship is fine, the materials used are substantial, plus it has an imported mechanical movement, so it has a certain weight. It's incomparable to those so-called mechanical watches that cost three or four hundred. This one is truly worth its price.
The watch keeps time very accurately, with errors completely within an acceptable range. The watch's packaging includes a jewelry appraisal certificate, and the 12 o'clock position on the dial is a real diamond. This watch is very suitable for personal use, and it also makes a prestigious gift.
The Bentley watch is indeed good.
The worst shopping experience in history.
On the evening of September 23rd, my wife dropped her phone. On a whim, I immediately ordered an iPhone 8 Plus from Amazon. It was in stock but not sold directly by Amazon, and there was no price increase (which made me secretly happy). However, because it was not sold directly by Amazon, the delivery was slower. The system showed that the latest expected delivery date would be September 27th.
My wife was extremely upset without her phone, and early the next morning at around 6, she asked me to figure something out. Later, I checked JD.com and saw that they had a 256GB model in stock that could be delivered the same day, so I had no choice but to immediately order one.
Once the new one is purchased, I plan to immediately cancel the Amazon order.
Since the order was placed in the middle of the night, it was impossible to receive the delivery in the early morning. I called customer service after 7 o'clock to request the cancellation of the order. The customer service replied that the order has been cancelled and to wait for a text message notification.
Alright, I waited patiently. When I checked my phone at noon, the order status was still 'not shipped'. I immediately contacted customer service to urgently cancel the order. The customer service replied that the operation was already OK.
At 3 p.m., I checked my phone and saw that the order was still there. I had no choice but to contact customer service again, making it clear that this was my third call, and asked them to cancel the order and notify the seller not to ship the item!
The customer service contacted the seller on the spot at my request, and informed me that the seller was not familiar with the system and needed to wait until they were familiar with the system before they could cancel the order.
But rest assured, the seller has been clearly informed and will definitely not ship the item.
When I checked the order status again on Monday, it had surprisingly already been shipped. I was speechless.
Since it is impossible to directly contact the seller, I can only call customer service again.
The handling afterwards left me speechless, basically, the customer service would only take action after I gave instructions.
The order is still in the status of refused delivery up to now, and is preparing for re-delivery!
Won't Amazon take the initiative to follow up?
The seller company doesn't care about follow-ups since they have already received the money.
In conclusion, I will definitely not prepay for large items in the future, it's too much trouble.
Looks very beautiful
I had my eye on this camera for a long time, but didn't buy it due to reasons other than the price. This time, because of the free shipping deal and the price being reasonable, I decided to purchase it.
After purchasing, there weren't any problems except for the software connection. No matter what, it just couldn't connect. My home uses a TP router. After searching online, I found that many people have this issue. I spent over two hours adjusting various router settings. In the end, I used 360WIFI as a medium to fix it. During this time, I called Xiaomi customer service, but they didn't have any solutions for this problem and directly told me to contact Amazon for after-sales service.
Another point worth noting is that I saw user comments online saying that the minimum storage card this camera supports is 8G. It cannot recognize cards with smaller storage capacity, so please be aware of this.
The usage feels okay, the display is acceptable, but the sound quality is very poor. The machine heats up to a certain extent, and if it's always on, this level of heat is somewhat hard to accept.
In conclusion, this product has many shortcomings. Please be cautious when purchasing.
The reason I gave it 3 stars is because this was bought with my first love. We were together for almost 3 years, and then it left me last year, up until now.
The reason I gave it 3 stars is because this was purchased with my first love in life. Now, I don't know to what extent it's been used, or perhaps it's been thrown away!
We were together for nearly 3 years, and then she left me last year. Every time I think of her, I feel so heartbroken that I want to leave this world. The first woman in my life has left me with a lifetime of shadows and heartache, and I still haven't been able to move on.
When buying this phone, I thought of two feelings at the time, we could share both joys and sorrows together, but now it's unbearable to look back. Perhaps this is life, there are some people you don't want to meet in a lifetime, and some things you don't want to know in a lifetime, but what can you do about it?
Every time I see this Samsung phone, I think of her, and the pain floods my entire body. I've never been willing to use a phone that costs more than 2,000 yuan, but when I bought it for her, I didn't hesitate. No matter how good you are to someone, when they change their heart one day, all the promises and vows will vanish like smoke.
High-quality products among domestic brands
Huawei is a premium product among domestic goods.
The low-profile boss and company rely on technology and quality to win customers, which is completely different from the current business trend of increasing visibility through advertising operations!
Companies without strength simply cannot achieve this, nor do they dare to do so!
It is precisely because of this that I chose Huawei.
I've been using it for over half a year since I bought it, and it feels consistently good, very nice indeed.
The reason I didn't give it a full score is because there was an instance when I was using its offline navigation, a positioning error occurred. I ultimately couldn't figure out the reason, but it works well at other times.
Moreover, once you input your destination online, it automatically designs a route. After leaving the wifi area, its automatic offline navigation feature is very practical, there's no need to use data. It communicates directly with satellites to achieve positioning and navigation, which is excellent!
Sony is great.
This low-end model from Sony still has a full sense of design, and it's cheap, with a large screen and excellent battery life. It's very suitable for the elderly to use.
Although a lot of time has passed, this machine still has no problems.
However, since my Z2 was demoted, this phone has also completed its mission.
