This not only confirms the theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers - which has been widely circulated - but also provides details that fossils usually cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the top of the bird's feathers are a reddish-brown color, while the bottom is a light color or a shade of orange.
This discovery also helps to deepen our understanding of the evolution of bird feathers.
Dinosaur feathers did not develop a main shaft, called a "rail," but still had other feather features, such as feather branches and feather filaments. Researchers hypothesized that the evolution of the rail may have occurred later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used for flight, but for regulating temperature or for display. Researchers believe that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows mature plumage, rather than the feathers of a young chick.
The researchers believe that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers, rather than downy feathers of a juvenile dinosaur.

Most of the work done was theoretical, but the purpose of writing the program was to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team is looking for may be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of galaxies and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a gravitational force on Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy.
Scientists can conclude that the way in which dark matter affects other dark matter is the same as that of ordinary matter.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is contained in some kind of halo around the galaxy, consisting of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: Voters go into a small booth and drop a preprinted slip of paper indicating their choice of candidate into an envelope.
After the official verifies the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the ballot register.
French electoral law sets out very strict rules for the electoral process.
Since 1988, the ballot box must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there is no envelope inside the box at the start of voting, and that no one other than those who are eligible to vote and have been timely counted have put an envelope into the box.
Candidates can send representatives to observe the election process at every stage. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision according to a specific procedure.

I told people: how we treat you, that's how you treat us.
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a bill banning the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.
The bill requires violent video games sold in California to be labeled with a "18" rating, and sellers who illegally sell them to minors will be fined $1,000 for each violation.
The Director of Public Prosecutions and Queen's Counsel Kier Starmer made a statement this morning announcing that he would be prosecuting Hoon and Pleasance.
Huhna has resigned, and his position in the cabinet will be taken over by Ed Davey, a member of parliament. It is expected that Norman Lamb, another member of parliament, will take over the vacant position of Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills.
Hoon and Price are due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16.
The victims were 25-year-old Nicholas Alden and 21-year-old Zachary Cuddeback. Cuddeback was driving the car at the time.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and chin, while Kristoffer Schneider required surgery for facial reconstruction.
Uka's weapon malfunctioned as it was aimed at the fifth person, leaving Schneider in agony with one eye blinded and a missing piece of skull, which was reconstructed using titanium plates.
Schneider testified via video link from a US Air Force (USAF) base in his home country.
In addition to the Wednesday race, Carpanedo also participated in two individual competitions at the championship.
Her first event was the Paralympic skiing, which she finished in the first round with a "did not finish" score. 36 of the 116 competitors in the event achieved the same score.
Her other competition was the all-around, where she placed tenth with a total score of 4:41.30 minutes in the women's floor exercise, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the Austrian winner Claudia Rosch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the Hungarian winner Gabriella DÃ¡ni.
Four skiers on the women's sitting team failed to finish the race, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom event failed to make the cut.
The Central Bureau of Investigation recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people for raping the Swiss woman and have found her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chandrashekhar Pawar, the police chief, said that the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, no one was injured in the end.
However, the driver's head was severely injured.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed, and emergency responders rescued the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth for treatment.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
After that, Adcock was charged with the murder of her son and was tried at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She was detained, awaiting prosecution and trial; however, any evidence from eyewitnesses could be negatively affected because her image had been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scotland's legal system is different, with the court believing that publishing the photos could cause potential harm.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee pointed out, "It does seem that there is a risk if journalists publish information such as photos of suspects."
The Royal Prosecution Service, the main department responsible for prosecution, told reporters that it would not make any further comments until the prosecution was initiated, at least.
According to reports, the document will refer to the border dispute, and Palestine hopes to base it on the pre-1967 Middle East War border.
Other topics reportedly discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demanded that military forces be deployed in the central valley for 10 years after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian National Authority only agreed to retain them for five years.
Forest rangers will closely monitor the shooters who participate in the supplementary trials for pest control, as the trials will be monitored and their effectiveness assessed.
In a partnership with the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the NSW Association of Riflemen, the Association of Riflemen recruited qualified volunteers for the hunting program.
Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) protection and heritage management branch in New South Wales, Australia, said that the four shooters who were selected to participate in the first shooting operation had all received comprehensive safety and training guidance.
Yesterday, Martelli was sworn in as a member of the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), which is made up of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth time being selected by the Provisional Electoral Council of Haiti (CEP) in the past four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP, as part of a push to move the country towards new electoral measures.
The commission was Martelly's response to the large-scale anti-government protests that began in October.
Since 2011, these protests have been sparked by the failure to hold some elections on time, and sometimes they have escalated into violent incidents.
It was reported that about 60 iPods had malfunctions and overheated, resulting in 6 fires and 4 people suffering minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that they have noted 27 accidents related to the device.
Last week, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating to the ministry, even though the company said these incidents were "not serious."
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry responded that Apple's delay in releasing the report was "very regrettable."
The Mariana Islands were struck by an earthquake at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT on Friday evening).
The Office of the Governor of Northern Mariana Islands reported that there were no disaster losses reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that no tsunami signs were found.
A former Philippine police officer hijacked a tour bus in the capital city of Manila and took Hong Kong tourists on board as hostages.
Rolando Mendoza set up his M16 rifle and fired at the tourists.
Several hostages were rescued, and at least six hostages were confirmed to have died.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers were released early.
The two photographers then took the place of an elderly woman who needed to use the bathroom, while Mendoza was killed.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career as a doctor.
He trained as an obstetrician and worked at Auckland's National Women's Hospital from 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began studying premature births in his spare time.
His research shows that the use of hormones can accelerate the maturation of the foetus' lungs.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators found two "black boxes" on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Mottola said, "Lourdes is the first Queen of Queens, my first manager. Lourdes passed away on the night of the full moon. A night like her is special. She was a strong woman."
Dustin Runnels (nicknamed "Goldust") commented, "Luna is as enigmatic as I am... she might be even more enigmatic... I love her and I think about her... I hope she's in a better place."
A survey of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal election found that the number of people who opposed Australia becoming a republic had grown by 8 per cent since 2008.
Julia Gillard, the caretaker Prime Minister, said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's abdication.
A unanimous 34% of respondents said they wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
The voting was polarized, with 29% of respondents believing that Australia should establish a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believed that Australia should never establish a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to compete in the 100 and 200 meter freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but his health has been called into question due to his complaints.
He was unable to take painkillers to alleviate the pain, as the competition prohibited competitors from taking such medication.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
In early February, a few people validated this discovery using different hardware and software and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may be the source of water and organic matter on Earth, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists want to know how planets, and especially the Earth, formed since the comet collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, has been governor since the beginning of the year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumor "political chatter and stupidity."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the United States claims that the NextGen air transportation system can enable aircraft to shorten flight routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, rather than the old-fashioned ground radar technology, which enables air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There are no additional modes of transport, and the surface train does not stop at Wembley, nor are there any parking lots or parking and transfer facilities.
Due to concerns about a lack of transportation, the match may be forced to take place behind closed doors without any team supporters.
On Thursday, a study published in the journal Science said that a new species of bird has emerged in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that due to the reproduction between the local Darwin's finches and the exotic Gould's finches, this new species has only evolved for two generations, although people believe that this process takes longer.
Gold can be processed into various shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be spun into thin threads and used for weaving and knotting. It can also be beaten or crushed into flakes.
It can be made very thin and stick to other metals. Because it is so thin, it can sometimes be used to decorate the hand-painted illustrations in books known as "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can use red cabbage juice to make an indicator.
The color of the beet juice will change depending on the acidity of the chemical.
The pH value represents the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost an electron (since a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Stir the two powders together, then use clean, damp hands to knead them into a ball.
The water on your hand will react with the outer layer, forming a kind of shell-like thing, which feels really interesting.
Almost every household in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet, which was connected to a sophisticated sewage treatment system.
The ruins of a sewage system were discovered in houses on the Greek island of Crete and in the city of St. Torigni-sur-Rouvre.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were always part of public baths that were used by both men and women.
You use satellites to call people who are thousands of miles away.
When a satellite in space receives a call, it almost immediately reflects it back.
Satellites are launched into space by rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts certain light and views.
A giant rocket more than 100 feet tall is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest contribution of the wheel to us is that it has made our transportation more convenient.
It is thanks to it that we have trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cat-like animals, which eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits and deer to deer.
In the end, many small carnivores (including pet cats that are allowed to roam free) feed on a much larger number of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a "leek," where each cat is responsible for a specific task, preventing them from competing with each other.
Lions are the most social of all the cat species, living in large groups called prides.
A pride of lions is made up of one to three adult males that are related, as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
As sisters and daughters in a large family, females are usually very close to each other.
The behavior of a pride of lions is very similar to that of a pack of wolves or dogs. These animals behave in a way that is strikingly similar to lions (but different from other large felines), and this behavior is also very deadly for their prey.
Tigers are all-round athletes. They can climb (although their climbing ability is not very strong), swim, jump, and their strength is five times that of a human strongman.
Tigers, lions, leopards, and jaguars belong to the same type (the Panthera genus). These four big cats are the only members of the cat family that roar.
The roar of a tiger is not as deep as that of a lion, but more like an angry growl.
Leopards like to eat small animals. If conditions allow, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. The prey of leopards is almost always much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that the jaguar cat tracks and hunts for prey by smell and sniffing out traces of its prey on the ground.
They have very strong night vision, can see very clearly in the dark, and are very secretive in their movements. The hunting method of the leopard is to blend in with the environment and then pounce on its prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from their original main population (for example, when they cross mountains and rivers, or when they reach a new island where it is impossible to return easily), they usually find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new populations will need different traits or adaptive abilities to become a strong competitor, rather than what they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, and they still need to adapt to their environment as before.
Over time, new populations began to adapt to their new environments, and they began to diverge from other populations.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will eventually look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process "speciation," which is the formation of new species. Speciation is a necessary result of evolution and is also a very important part of it.
Plants can produce oxygen that humans can breathe in and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants obtain nutrients from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make houses out of plants, and we make clothes out of plants. Most of the food we eat is plant-based. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Qionglong was the top predator of that era, and it feared nothing except its own kind.
Its long lower jaw is covered in more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, with an additional row on its upper jaw. This means that anything that comes into contact with it has no chance of escape.
Its tongue may be forked, but we are not sure about that. Its diet includes sea turtles, large fish, other plesiosaurs, and even humans.
It will attack anything that enters the water; even a giant dinosaur like a Tyrannosaurus Rex is no match for it.
Although most of the Roman foods are familiar to us, they did have some strange or unusual banquet dishes, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a rodent called the medlar mouse.
Another difference is that the poor and women sit on chairs to eat, while the rich prefer to hold banquets together and eat while lying on their sides.
Foods that were introduced to Europe from the Americas or Asia several centuries later could not have been part of the Roman diet.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Romans ever ate fried chicken.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which they considered to be the god's home.
People would offer sacrifices to the gods, and priests would meet the needs of the gods through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Some special towers are in the shape of pyramids and are called pyramid-shaped shrines, which were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower is a special sanctuary of God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house is not that important.
The lives of Hebrew families were mostly spent outdoors.
Women cook in the courtyards; the shops are actually open counters facing the street. They build their houses with stones.
There are no large forests in Canaan, so wood is very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. According to the Nordic epic Saga of the Icelanders, Eric the Red, who was expelled from Iceland for committing murder, sailed westward and discovered land, which he named Greenland.
But whether he found it or not, the Eskimos were already living there.
Although they are all part of the "Scandinavian" region, there are many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think the back of the Declaration of Independence has a treasure map on it.
However, that is not the case. While the back of the document does contain some information, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence reads "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776." The words are written at the bottom of the document, but upside down.
Although no one knows who the author was, this large parchment document (29Â¾ inches by 24Â½ inches) was said to have been folded and stored when it was first written.
Therefore, it is likely that the symbol was added only as a label.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south remained unliberated.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French. These French people reached a peace agreement with the Germans in 1940, and instead of resisting the invaders, they cooperated with them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, an attack that became known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the armies of the United States and Free France liberated southern France and turned their sights towards Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a group of people (society) who live together and work together.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis" ("of citizens"), which is related to the Latin "civis" ("citizen") and "civitas" ("city" or "commonwealth"), which also in some way define the scale of society.
City-states were the forerunners of nations. Civilized culture means the passing down of knowledge from generation to generation, the cultural footprints remaining, and the ability of culture to be fairly transmitted.
Minority cultures often disappear without a trace, without leaving any historical evidence, and are not considered to be a proper civilization.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation (Congress was its only component).
Congress has no power to levy taxes, and because there is no national executive or judicial branch, Congress can only rely on state governments to enforce all bills, which state governments often refuse to do.
It also has no power to overturn state tax laws and tariffs.
These provisions must be agreed upon by all states in order to be amended, and the states have been so dismissive of the central government that their state representatives often fail to show up.
The Italian national football team and the German national football team are both the second most successful teams in the world, having won the World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the north, where Italians participate in international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh-largest island country in the world!
Because Japan has many islands, it is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geological perspective.
Western knowledge of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by named the island "Ilha Formosa," meaning "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan and began to change the indigenous people's methods of food production, and hired Chinese workers to work in its rice and sugar cane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal areas in the west and north of Taiwan. In 1885, the Qing Empire declared the establishment of a province in Taiwan.
In 1895, after being defeated in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled Taiwan until 1945.
The ancient city of Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the House of the Three Windows.
In order to allow tourists to better understand the original appearance of the architectural complex, most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been reconstructed.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is the 35mm format, which was the dominant film size at the end of the film era.
Production still continues today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been applied to the format of digital camera image sensors.
The actual size of the 35 mm format is 36 mm wide and 24 mm high, which is a bit confusing in terms of its format.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (the simplest integer ratio obtained by dividing by 12) is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format series) have the same aspect ratio or are very close to it.
The rule of thirds, which is often abused and ridiculed, is a simple guideline for creating dynamic images and can also help keep images orderly.
It notes that the most effective placement for the subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three parts, both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was closely monitored.
Despite the fact that the languages and customs of European countries are different, Christianity has been uniting them for more than a thousand years.
From kings to commoners, its power, which permeates the ten directions, affects everyone.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's Money Fund is specifically set up for this purpose.
The centralized power of the church in Rome existed for more than a thousand years, and the concentration of power and money began to raise questions among many people about whether they were following this creed.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, the United Kingdom began to impose a naval blockade on Germany.
They cut off the supply of military and civilian goods that were vital for life. This strategy proved to be effective, even though such a blockade violated international law, which had been widely accepted by everyone for the past two centuries, based on several international agreements.
The United Kingdom laid mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire area, even threatening neutral ships.
Because the response to this strategy has been limited, Germany hopes that its unrestricted submarine war will also have a similar response.
In the 1920s, the mainstream attitude of most citizens was pacifist and separatist.
After witnessing the devastation and brutality of World War I, countries around the world were eager to avoid repeating the same mistakes.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and took up a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
When he arrived in the United States, he had 4 cents, a collection of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) to Thomas Edison.
Different periods in ancient China had their own characteristics; each period in China or each family that ruled the country was a distinct dynasty.
Similarly, the period of small states splitting up during the succession of dynasties is an unstable era. The most famous of these is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years and was between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these turbulent times, various lords fought fierce wars to claim the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period is one of the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest power in the luxurious palace of Xi'an.
There are also many social and political influences, such as the use of measurement units, the transition from autocracy to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state does not belong to a single ruler, but to the people.
In addition, after the revolution, the civil service opened up to all men, which gave the most ambitious and successful people the opportunity to rise to the top.
The same goes for the military, because the rank of an officer is no longer based on their position in the hierarchy, but on their abilities.
The French Revolution also inspired oppressed working classes in many other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was interested in things beyond the mundane. He used to go to a cave called "Hira" in the "Nur" (light) mountain to meditate.
The cave itself, not only has withstood the test of time and remained intact, but also provides an extremely vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual intentions.
The cave is located on the top of a mountain in the north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, even if you know it exists, it's not easy to find. Once you enter the cave, you're completely cut off from the world.
Apart from the clear and beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains, nothing else can be seen. In the cave, it is almost impossible to see or hear anything from the outside.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid is a masterpiece of the Egyptians from the 3rd century BC. It is one of the many large pyramids that pay tribute to the late pharaohs.
The Giza plateau in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings (i.e., the "Giza pyramid complex") includes several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several smaller tombs, several temples, and a number of sphinxes.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Hufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Hufu's wife and family members.
The "draw bow" symbol looks like the letter V, and the "draw arrow" symbol looks like a nail or a square with a missing bottom edge.
Upward means starting from the top to draw the bow, and downward means starting from the base of the bow (where the hand grips the bow).
The upper bow usually produces a softer sound, while the lower bow produces a stronger, more determined sound.
Please feel free to make your own markings with a pencil, but remember that the printed notes are musically significant, so they should usually be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two children (11-year-old Marie ThÃ©rÃ¨se and 4-year-old Louis Charles), as well as the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were chased from Versailles back to Paris by a group of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, and were surrounded by a group of people who threatened the king and queen with loud shouts and cries.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows completely.
In front of a terrified queen, one of the rioters brandished the head of a Royal Guard who had been killed at the Palace of Versailles.
The war expenses of the United States imperialism in conquering the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of their expenses, as well as the interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the high profits obtained by long-term exploitation of the Filipino people became the basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the background that led to the formation of the order.
The time of the events is usually referred to as the high Middle Ages, the period of the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300), which is often called the European Middle Ages.
The period before the height of the Middle Ages is known as the Early Middle Ages, and the period after is known as the Late Middle Ages, which is conventionally considered to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses many ideas in practice, including technological determinism, technological necessity, and a strict definition - the fate of humanity is driven by the underlying logic related to scientific laws and its manifestation in technology.
Most explanations of the technological determinist view include these two general ideas: first, the development of technology itself has largely transcended cultural or political influence; second, technology, in turn, has an inherent "influence" on society that is not constrained by social conditions.
For example, someone might say that cars will necessarily promote the development of roads.
However, building a national road network for only a few cars is not economically feasible, so a new production method was born to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The high number of Volkswagen vehicles in circulation also leads to a higher rate of road traffic accidents, which will drive the invention of new medical technologies for repairing injuries.
Romanticism has strong cultural determinist overtones, originating with writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped the individual, and over time, geographically related customs and cultures emerged. These customs and cultures were much better than any imposed laws because they harmonized with the place where society was located.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of the European feudal era.
Its reputation as a center of luxury goods began around the year 400 and continued until around the year 1100.
Its status declined in the 12th century, mainly because the gifts brought back by the Crusaders, such as silk and spices, were more valuable than those available in the Byzantine market.
It was at this time that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, the dress was heavily influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to the slow pace of cultural exchange, Western fashion may be 25 to 30 years behind.
As the Middle Ages drew to a close, the people of Western Europe gradually developed their own style. One of the biggest advances at the time was the use of buttons to fasten clothing, following the Crusades.
Subsistence agriculture is an agricultural activity that is carried out in order to produce food that can only meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple and usually organic system that uses local seeds stored in the ecological zone and combines them with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers engaged in self-sufficient agricultural production. Today, this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel ignored by societal standards, and subcultures foster a sense of identity among them.
Given the differences in age, race, class, location, and/or gender among members, subcultures may be distinct.
The qualities that make a subculture distinctive may be a combination of language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, geography, or multiple factors.
Members of subcultures often use unique styles of behavior, including fashion, mannerisms, and slang, symbolically to indicate their membership.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to use the case of a few unfortunate children who, because they were neglected, suffered misfortune, or were deliberately mistreated, did not achieve socialization with the help of adults in their upbringing.
Such children are called "wild children," meaning that they are like wild animals. Some wild children are imprisoned by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the child is abandoned because the parents refuse to accept the child's serious intellectual or physical disabilities.
Before being abandoned or running away from home, feral children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma.
It is said that others were raised by animals; some people live alone in the wild.
If a wolf child is raised entirely by non-human animals, its behavior (to the extent that its physical condition allows) will be very similar to that of the animal, for example, it will show fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more fun, the scaffolded approach goes even further.
Tutorials are not a learning method, but a means of assisting those who have just started using a new computer program or initiated a new project.
Tutoring can be done online or offline, in other words, teachers are a form of tutoring, like the Clippy assistant in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is embedded in the software to challenge, prompt and explain procedures that may be difficult for students to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment without discipline, love, or education, but that is unfortunately the case.
We believe the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable medical care.
The foster care system should provide all the necessities that the child's original family lacks.
The Internet combines the elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet add an extra dimension to its uses and ways of meeting needs.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" were considered to be important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
In studying the audience's response to websites, Emery and McLeod (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "sustained relationships" as new motivational factors.
The use of video has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions (facial movements that last a few milliseconds).
Specifically, it is said that one can determine whether someone is lying by correctly interpreting their micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay "The President's Speech," notes that people who have suffered brain damage and are unable to understand language are still able to accurately judge whether the speaker is being sincere.
He even suggested that this ability to understand human behavior may be a common trait among animals such as dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two types of gene variations: overt and covert.
Mutations add new genetic variations, while selections remove variations from the pool of expressed genetic variations.
Due to the separation and recombination, the variants move back and forth between the two pools in each generation.
In the tropical grasslands, primates have a digestive system similar to humans, and the existing plant resources are difficult to meet the primates' needs for amino acids.
Moreover, failure to do so will have serious consequences: growth inhibition, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest plant resources to obtain are the leaves and proteins from legumes, but primates like us have a hard time digesting these proteins unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide a large amount of protein, containing all the necessary amino acids.
In light of the above, it should come as no surprise that if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in the same way as the black apes on tropical grasslands today, we should not be surprised.
Sleep interruption refers to the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep and falling back asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This is easy to do by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm clock while you're sleeping, you can put the clock on the other side of the room to force yourself out of bed to turn it off.
Other choices based on the biological clock include drinking a large amount of liquid, especially water or tea (which is known to have diuretic effects) before bedtime, and forcing oneself to urinate.
The degree of calmness in a person's inner world is inversely proportional to the degree of tension in their body and mind.
The less pressure, the more active the vitality. Everyone has the potential to find absolute calm and satisfaction.
Everyone can reach the state of enlightenment, and the only obstacle to achieving it is our own anxiety and negative emotions.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been expanded through the universal love of Mahayana Buddhism and the many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the method of universal love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visual images.
The core activity of Tibetan meditation is Tien Yoga. By personifying different gods, the energy channels are purified, the acupoints are activated, and the state of enlightenment is achieved.
Germany was the common enemy of all countries during World War II, which promoted cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. As the war came to an end, institutional, procedural, and cultural conflicts caused the two countries to part ways.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
This war lasted for 40 years, and the proxy armies fought real battles on many battlefields from Africa to Asia, including in Afghanistan and Cuba.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defenses had been breached, and the only hope left was to retreat and reorganize the army along the Romanian bastion.
However, these plans were almost immediately abandoned, and after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Peace in Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops entered the country and established a foothold in Belarus and Ukraine.
To date, shipping is the most effective way to transport large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
Traditionally, the Navy's mission is to ensure that the country maintains the ability to transport people and goods, while also disrupting the enemy's ability to transport their own people and goods.
One of the most notable modern examples is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans attempted to cross the Atlantic to transport personnel and supplies to help the British.
At the same time, the German navy, which relied on U-boats, attempted to intercept the transport.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would have probably conquered Britain just as it had conquered the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient civilizations and tribes began to domesticate them, eating and using their milk, meat, fur, and skin.
The family sheep are usually herded in groups on the mountains or other grazing areas, and they are usually looked after by shepherds (mostly children or teenagers), who are similar to the more widely known shepherds. These grazing methods are still in use today.
Britain built truck lanes as early as the 16th century.
Although the marathon carriage was made of parallel wooden planks, at the time, for the somewhat bumpy roads, these carriages allowed the horses to pull faster and carry more.
Railroad ties were introduced early on to fix the tracks, but people gradually realized that if iron plates were placed on the tracks, the tracks would be more stable and effective.
This became the common practice, but the iron plates made the wooden cart wheels wear out more severely.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron track was introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking. 2 million years ago, with the emergence of Homo erectus, humans began to walk upright.
Their ancestors, the southern apes, did not have the habit of walking upright.
The phenomenon of bipedalism was discovered in the fossils of the southern ape-like ancestor dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropus from Chad may have been walking on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, join environmental movements, and even become environmental activists, which will reduce the disasters in the future to a certain extent.
In many cases, this is similar to symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not just want a temporary solution, we should find the root cause of the problem and eradicate it completely.
It is obvious that the world has undergone great changes due to the scientific and technological progress of human beings, and the problem has become more serious due to the overpopulation and the luxurious lifestyle of human beings.
The handwritten draft, signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was approved by the Continental Congress on July 4 and then sent to the John Dunlap Printing Shop, located a few blocks away, for printing.
150 to 200 copies were printed overnight, which is now known as the "Dunlap broadsides" edition.
On July 8, John Nixon first publicly read the document aloud in the yard of the Independence Hall.
One of these letters was sent to George Washington on July 6, and Washington read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy of the letter arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 remaining copies of the Dunlap broadsides are the earliest versions of the document that have survived. The original manuscript has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and continued to exist until today, which is what we call "birds."
Many people believe that they are not dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still many places where birds are similar to dinosaurs.
They have scales on their feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Today, almost all computers in use are based on processing information in binary code.
Binary numbers can only take one of two values, either 0 or 1, and are called binary digits, or "bits," in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not immediately manifest itself, and symptoms such as vomiting are common, so a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The most powerful indication of the ingestion of poison is the presence of an opened container on the scene, containing drugs or household toxic chemicals.
Check the label on the poison for specific first aid instructions.
Entomologists use the term "bug" to formally refer to this class of insects.
The term comes from people's familiarity with the botfly, a parasitic insect that is very well adapted to living on humans.
Both the parasitic wasp and the fungus gnat are nesting insects that have adapted to live in the nests or dwellings of their hosts.
There are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, and the disease has become the leading neurological disease among middle-aged and young people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system (composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves).
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis (MS).
A couple may decide not to have children for their own benefit or for the benefit of their children.
These couples may have adoption plans for their children.
In the adoption process, the biological parents terminate their parental rights, so that another couple can raise the child.
The main purpose of science is to find out how the world works through scientific methods. In fact, this method can guide most scientific research.
An experiment is an attempt to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, but it is not the only way. Asking questions and making observations can also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers were interested in classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on all areas of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the physiological and behavioral rhythms observed by researchers are often heavily dependent on endogenous cycles generated by the biological clock and their presence.
The cyclical rhythm is not just a simple response to external cyclical signals. This rhythm has been recorded in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillating device that continues to function freely for a period of time even in the absence of external cues.
The experiment by Hershey and Chase demonstrated that DNA is one of the primary indicators of genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, one to label the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus and the other to label the phage proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a wide range of effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cell is a germ cell.
Only mutations in reproductive cells are passed on to children, while mutations in other cells lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature and scenery tourism attracts visitors interested in natural areas, who come to observe natural landscapes, including wildlife.
Activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park tours, and ecosystem research.
For example, visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of the small towns to go to work, and the places where the people they pass on the road work are the places they leave.
In this dynamic traffic flow, everyone is connected to and supports the car-based transportation system in some way.
Now, science shows that this large-scale carbon economy can no longer maintain the stability of the biosphere that has supported human evolution and development for the past 2 million years.
Everyone is a part of society and uses the transportation system. And almost everyone has complaints about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about the quality of water or the extent of bridge collapses.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints? Why do they break down every day? Is it because transportation engineers are not doing their jobs well, or is there a more fundamental reason?
Traffic flow studies the movement of drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because it is not possible to make 100% certain predictions about the behavior of drivers.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers tends to be within a reasonable level of consistency; thus, traffic flow often has a certain level of consistency, which can be roughly expressed mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between the following three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects are the earliest animals to fly in the air. The ability to fly makes it easier for them to evade enemies and more effectively find food and mates.
Most insects have an advantage in that they can fold their wings back along their bodies.
This gives them more small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings backwards are dragonflies and damselflies.
Several thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people think he was right, but many disagree; they believe that the solar system revolves around the Earth, and that the sun does too (and even other stars do).
This seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world. Its water volume is more than 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with some sections as wide as 6 miles.
The Amazon River accounts for 20% of all the rivers in the world that flow into the sea.
The Amazon River main stream is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. The river water comes from thousands of smaller tributaries.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the grandeur of the Giza pyramids and their advanced construction techniques have never been surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were awed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world and also the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its laws, regulations, and official communications.
Italian is also the language most people working in the country use on a daily basis, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because these elements can be found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that any object is made up of one or more of the four elements of earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like the four states of matter (solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, in no particular order): he proposed a theory that they transform into new matter, which makes up the things we see.
Alloys are basically made up of two or more metals mixed together. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Calcium, potassium, and other elements are metals. Silver and gold, of course, are metals as well.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements (such as carbon).
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that the period at the end of this sentence could contain millions of billions of atoms.
Therefore, when the pencil was first introduced, it became a favorite of many people.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods emerged, the pencil's status became lower and its use became less frequent.
People are now writing on computer screens, and they never have to touch quills and pens again.
One can only guess what the future holds for the keyboard as new products emerge.
The principle of the operation of a fission atomic bomb is as follows: it takes energy to bring a nucleus and many protons and neutrons together.
It's a bit like pushing a heavy little cart up a hill, splitting the atomic nucleus again and releasing some energy.
Some atoms contain unstable nuclei, which means that they are likely to split under little or no stimulation.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick near the surface and about 100 km thick at a distance.
The crust under the dark side is thinner, while the crust under the highlands is thicker.
Because the crust is thinner, the near side may have more dark areas, and lava is more likely to rise to the surface.
The core of the content theory of motivation is to find factors that people can identify with or find interesting.
These theories suggest that as people mature to a certain degree and enter adulthood, certain needs and/or desires are internalized.
These theoretical studies explain why some people want to do what they do, and what in their environment makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, when managers start leading former colleagues, two behaviors emerge. In one case, they try to maintain a "close relationship" with team members.
It is difficult for managers of this type to make unpopular decisions, and they also have difficulties in implementing disciplinary measures, performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
In another extreme case, this person becomes a completely different individual from before, feeling that he/she must change everything the team does and take credit for the results.
After all, leaders are ultimately responsible for the success or failure of their teams.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between leaders and other members of the team.
Virtual teams need to maintain the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the point of contact for their corresponding offline teams.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, because their teams may schedule meetings for different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The existence of a genuine "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
An "invisible team" refers to a management team that each member reports to. It sets standards for all members.
Why does an organization take so long to build a learning organization? One of the goals of putting the concept of organizational learning into practice is innovation.
Creativity and originality occur when all available resources are effectively utilized among the functional departments of an organization.
Therefore, an organization, in the process of working together to overcome obstacles, often brings new innovative processes to meet the needs of customers.
Before an organization can innovate, leaders must create a culture of innovation, share knowledge, and engage in organized learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a way to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical methods of cognitive research. Therefore, it narrows the scope of research and makes it more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior can provide support for researchers.
We have known for a long time that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors can affect a person's behavior and cause certain mental functions to change.
The emergence of new technologies has allowed us to see and study the structure and workings of the brain, which were previously unknown.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to build a simulation model, which helps us understand the process of how the brain operates.
Artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction flavor, but it is actually a very important branch of computer science, which studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
The study of artificial intelligence (AI) involves the creation of machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnostics and customer issues, handwriting recognition, voice and facial recognition.
All of these have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to problems in real life.
Artificial intelligence systems are now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military. Some home computers and video game software applications already have built-in artificial intelligence systems.
Field trips are an important part of any educational experience. Often, teachers are happy to take students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Virtual field trips are a high-tech solution. Students can watch museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art in the classroom.
Sharing the field trip experience virtually is also a good way to review the itinerary and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned every year, but the old versions are kept online as a scrapbook.
Blogging can also help students improve their writing skills. Although students often use careless grammar and spelling when they first start blogging, the presence of readers usually changes that.
Students are often the most critical readers, so blog authors begin to strive to improve their writing skills in order to avoid criticism.
In addition, writing blogs also "forces students to become more perceptive of the world around them." By satisfying the interests of their audience, students are encouraged to become smart and interesting.
Blogging is a tool that can inspire collaboration and encourage students to extend their learning beyond traditional classroom instruction.
"By using blogs appropriately, students can become better at analysis and critical thinking; by actively responding to online materials, students can find their own positions in the context of others' articles and can put forward their own opinions on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa, the capital of Canada, is a charming city that uses a bilingual system. It is known for its series of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south is Niagara Falls, and to the north is Muskoka River and the undeveloped natural beauty across from it.
All of these things make Ontario the quintessential image of Canada that outsiders imagine.
Further north, the vast area is sparsely populated, and some places are barren wilderness with no sign of human life.
A striking set of population data: the number of African Americans living in the United States is greater than the number of Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island to date, and is still a separate continent for wildlife.
The smaller islands are mostly independent countries or belong to France, and they are famous for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to this land, and this doctrine is prevalent in the Comoros and Mayotte countries.
Europe's influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape of Good Hope route from Europe to India.
It is bordered by the Sahel in the north and the Atlantic Ocean in the south and west.
Female: It is recommended that all female tourists, regardless of their actual marital status, should say that they are married.
Wearing a ring can also help (but don't wear a ring that looks too expensive.
Women should be aware that cultural differences may lead to what they perceive as harassment; and being followed, grabbed, etc. is not uncommon.
When rejecting a man, you need to be firm and not be afraid to stand by your position (regardless of cultural differences, you need to firmly reject him!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids (Merenid), who called the port Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it, naming it Casa Branca, until they abandoned it after the earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya. Spanish merchants established a trading post here and named it CÃ¡ceres.
Casablanca is one of the most boring shopping destinations in all of Morocco.
Shops selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, and water pipes, as well as various trinkets, can be found near the old city of Medina. However, these shops are all aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located on the easternmost edge of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano. The volcanic lava buried most of the town's streets, particularly in the town center.
Although Goma is still considered safe, anyone traveling to any location outside of Goma should research in advance to determine if the ongoing fighting in North Kivu has subsided.
The city is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and for the cheapest gorilla tracking project in Africa.
You can explore Goma by boda-boda (a motorcycle taxi). The normal (local) price for a short ride is 500 Congolese francs.
Also, because it is relatively remote, "Tibetan" has been used to describe a distant foreign land.
Today, although TÃ¤ngertu is known for being a tourist destination and has an airport, it is a poor town.
In 1990, it was listed as an endangered World Heritage site due to the threat of the desert.
This was an important stop for Henry Louis Gates in the PBS special "African American Lives."
The city stands in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it is more Arabic in style than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River forms the border to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones to support different wild flora and fauna.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered to be the flagship site of the South African National Parks (SANParks) system.
Like all South African national parks, the park charges a conservation fee and an entrance fee every day.
There are many benefits to buying a Wild Card. With this card, you can enter some or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island is synonymous with Hong Kong and is the focal point for many tourists.
The numerous buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline are like a flashing bar graph, especially striking against the backdrop of Victoria Harbour.
If you want to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite side of Kowloon waterfront.
Most urban development in Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land on the north shore.
This is where British colonizers occupied the land, so if you want to find evidence of the colonial history of this territory, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) along the coast from Bangladesh to the interior of India.
Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest located in India is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, these forests are not just mangrove swamps, but also contain the remnants of some vast jungles that once covered the plains of the Ganges.
SunndalsÃ¸ra has an area of 3,850 square kilometres, of which about one third is water/swamp area.
Sundarbans has been a wildlife reserve since 1966. It is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 sambar deer living in the area.
Buses run from the intercity bus station (across the river) all day, but most services, especially those to the east and Jakaal/Bumthang, run between 06:30 and 07:30.
Given that the express buses are often fully booked, it is recommended that you purchase tickets a few days in advance.
You can sit comfortably on a sturdy Japanese Coaster bus in most areas.
If you want to go to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200), shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get there.
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects Oiapoque, Brazil, with Saint-Georges, French Guiana.
The two towers of the bridge are 83 meters high, and the bridge is 378 meters long, with two 3.50-meter-wide lanes.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The project was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, at which time the Brazilian customs checkpoint is also expected to be completed.
The GuaranÃ­ are the most important indigenous group living in the present-day region of Eastern Paraguay. They lead a semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle and also engage in self-sufficient agricultural activities.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who survive by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, in the 16th century, was called the "Great Indian Province," a product of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a three-century-long period of colonization.
Paraguay has managed to preserve many of the city's indigenous features and characteristics since AsunciÃ³n was founded in 1537.
Argentina is famous for having the world's top polo teams and players.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo field in Las CaÃ±itas.
On other days throughout the year, smaller tournaments and competitions can also be seen here.
For information on the tournament and how to purchase tickets for the horse races, please visit the Argentine Horse Racing Association website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound, which is equivalent to the British pound.
Currency can be exchanged at the island's only bank, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The pound is generally accepted everywhere on the island, and credit cards and US dollars are often accepted within Stanley.
Credit cards may not be accepted on the outer islands, but US and UK currencies are; please contact the host in advance to confirm the accepted payment methods.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency off the island, so it must be exchanged before leaving.
Montevideo is located south of the equator, so during the winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; in the summer months, temperatures often exceed 30Â°C.
Winter may feel colder than it looks: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but when wind and humidity combine, it can feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There is no specific "rainy season" and "dry season" here: the amount of rainfall throughout the year is roughly the same.
Although many animals in the park are used to human beings, wild animals are still wild animals, and we should not feed or disturb them.
The park's management says to keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may appear, bison, moose, elk, bears, and almost all other large animals are capable of attacking humans.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year for failing to maintain proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so please give them some space.
In addition, it should be noted that the smell will attract bears and other wild animals, so it is necessary to avoid bringing or cooking food that emits a smell, and to keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was first established in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The gulf was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the bay.
All but one British cruiser sank, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the struggle for independence organized by the Me'ekuu movement, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the death of the paramount chief, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland spans two harbours, so there are many beaches in the area. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (located within the North Head area) stretch along the Pacific Ocean from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
It's almost all beach here, swimming is safe, and there's plenty of shade from New Zealand Christmas trees.
Tamaki Drive beach is located on Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in the central part of Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes crowded with vacationing families, and there are all sorts of shops lining the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main beer in the area is "Number One" beer. It is not complex in taste, but it is very refreshing and easy to drink. Another local beer is called "Manta."
You can buy a lot of French wines here, but wines from New Zealand and Australia may be more suitable for long-distance transportation.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you are still concerned, bottled water is readily available.
The concept of "latte macchiato" coffee is still relatively unfamiliar to Australians. A small cup of black coffee is "espresso," the whipped cream (not foam) on a cappuccino is piled high, and tea is not paired with milk.
Hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The price of fruit juice is expensive, but the quality is good.
Many people visit the Great Barrier Reef throughout the year, and there are few incidents of injury on the reef as a result of participating in any of the activities mentioned above.
Despite this, you should still follow the advice of the relevant authorities, observe all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish can be found on the beaches and estuaries near 1770 town between October and April each year, and occasionally at other times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
The main habitat of the saltwater crocodile is not the ocean, but the estuaries of the north of Rockhampton.
Early booking can give travelers peace of mind, knowing that they will have a place to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Although travel agencies may help you book glamping and other forms of accommodation, they usually work with specific hotels.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, and some even offer flight and hotel accommodation packages.
If you need time to consider whether the price is suitable or if you need to obtain other documents (such as a visa) to reach your destination, they can reserve the booking for you.
If any changes need to be made or if there are any requests, they should be made through the travel agent, not directly with the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of attendees choose to camp on site, and most attendees consider this to be an essential part of the festival experience.
If you want to see the performance up close, you'll need to get there early and stake out a spot near the stage.
Remember, while the music on the main stage may have ended, other parts of the festival may keep the music going well into the night.
Some music festivals have special camping areas for families with children.
If you cross the North Sea in winter, you need to check the location of the passenger cabins, because sailing on ice can create a very scary noise for those who are most affected.
The St. Petersburg cruise includes an in-city tour. Cruise passengers may be eligible for a visa waiver (please see the terms and conditions for details).
Casinos generally try to make customers spend as much time and money as possible. Casinos usually do not have windows or clocks, and the exits are often hard to find.
They usually provide special food, drinks, and entertainment activities to keep customers happy and make them stay at the casino.
Some venues offer free alcoholic beverages. However, intoxication weakens a person's judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving or crossing mountain passes in high-latitude areas should consider the possibility of encountering snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On snow-covered roads, there is little friction, so you can't drive as you would on a smooth asphalt road.
In a blizzard, the snowfall can be enough to trap you in a very short amount of time.
Snow, blowing snow, drops of water or ice on the windshield may also obstruct vision.
On the other hand, snow and ice weather is common in many countries, and transportation is almost never disrupted throughout the year.
Hunting safaris are perhaps the most attractive tourist activities in Africa, and are a highlight of many visitors' itineraries.
The word "safari" is commonly used to refer to a land-based journey to observe the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially in the tropical grasslands.
Some animals (such as elephants and giraffes) often like to get close to cars, and standard equipment can make it easier to appreciate them.
Lions, cheetahs, and jaguars are sometimes afraid of people, and you can see them more clearly with binoculars.
Hiking (also called "bushwalking," "backpacking," or "trekking") is primarily walking on foot, usually taking several hours or lasting several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other parts of Japan.
Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, the first of which was in 1964.
If you booked a flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may face a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most cancellations due to COVID-19 have not been extended to July 2020, the originally scheduled date of the Olympics.
It is expected that the ticket prices for most events will be between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, with the average price being around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry out. Even if there is no iron and ironing board in the room, many hotels offer a borrowing service.
If you don't have an iron or you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try a hair dryer (if you have one).
Be careful not to make the clothes too hot (this can cause them to shrink, and in extreme cases, even burn them).
There are many methods for purifying water, and some are more effective against specific contaminants.
In some areas, boiling for one minute is enough, while in other areas it takes several minutes.
The effect of filters varies, and if you are concerned about this, you should consider buying bottled water in sealed containers from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter harmful animals that are not common in their home country.
Pests can damage food, causing irritation, and in more severe cases, allergic reactions, spreading toxins or infectious diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can kill humans through violence, are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping refers to the opportunity to purchase duty-free goods at a specific location.
Travelers to countries/regions that levy high taxes on cigarettes can sometimes save a lot of money, and buying products such as alcohol and tobacco is especially good value in these places.
The most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway are between Point Marion and Fairmont, where the road frequently passes through remote and isolated areas.
If you're not used to driving on rural roads, you'd better keep your wits about you: There are steep hills, narrow roads, and sharp turns everywhere.
The speed limit posted there is significantly lower than that of the sections before and after it, and the common speed limit is 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and the importance of strictly following the speed limit requirements is greater than that of other sections.
However, strangely enough, the cell phone service here is much stronger than on many other stretches of road along the way (such as the Pennsylvania prairie).
German pastries are great, but Bavarian pastries are even more diverse and similar to those of Austria, their neighbors to the south.
Fruit pastry is very common, and apples can be used to make pastry all year round. In the summer, you can also eat cherries and apricots.
Many German baked goods also feature almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes are often paired with strong coffee.
If you want to try some flavorful little sweets, you can try a jam-filled pastry, which is called something different in different regions, such as Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry rice is a dish made with spices and herbs, and is served with meat or vegetables.
Curry rice can be either "dry" or "wet," depending on how much water is used.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, sour milk is often used in curry; while in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
Indonesia has 17,000 islands, so Indonesian cuisine is a collective term that encompasses a wide variety of local cuisines throughout the country.
However, without further adjectives, the term usually refers to food that originates from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now, you can find Javanese cuisine all over the islands. There are many dishes with simple seasoning methods. The main seasoning ingredients that Javanese people like are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various spices.
The stirrups are hung on either side of the saddle and are used to support the rider's feet.
They provide better stability for delivery people, but also pose a safety hazard because the delivery person's feet can get stuck.
If the rider falls off the horse but one foot is caught in the stirrup, the horse may drag him along as it runs. To minimize the risk, some precautions can be taken.
Firstly, most horse riders wear shoes with horseshoe cleats, and the soles are smooth and quite narrow.
Secondly, some saddles - especially English saddles - have safety clasps that will release the girth strap if the rider falls off and pulls backwards.
The CochamÃ³ Valley in Chile is the preferred destination for mountaineers and is known as the Yosemite of South America. It features a variety of granite cliffs and rock walls.
The mountain peaks offer a breathtaking view. Climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes on the steep cliffs that serve as climbing walls.
Alpine skiing, which includes both downhill skiing and snowboarding, is a very popular sport. In this sport, skis or snowboards are attached to your feet and you slide down snow-covered terrain.
Skiing is the main tourist activity for many ski enthusiasts, who are sometimes referred to as "ski bums" and plan to ski at a location for the entirety of their vacation.
The idea of skiing has been around for a long time - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BCE!
As a sport, downhill skiing can be traced back to at least the 17th century. In 1861, Norwegians opened the first skiing club for recreational skiing in Australia.
Skiing self-guided tour: This activity is also called cross-country skiing, ski touring or ski trekking.
This activity is related to Alpine skiing or mountaineering trips, but usually does not involve these two activities. These two activities are performed on steep terrain and require harder skis and boots.
Imagine the ski runs as similar hiking trails.
In good conditions, you can go further than walking - but only in very few cases will you be able to achieve the same speed as cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on a level track.
Europe is a continent with a relatively small area but many independent countries. In general, traveling across multiple countries means having to go through visa applications and passport checks multiple times.
However, in this regard, the Schengen area is a bit like a country.
As long as you are staying in this area, you can usually cross the border directly without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa separately to each Schengen member country, thereby saving time, money, and hassle.
There is no universally agreed-upon definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax agencies define an antique as an item that is at least 100 years old.
This definition varies by region; in North America, for example, the age limit may be shorter than in Europe.
Crafts may be defined as antiques, even though they are much younger than their mass-produced counterparts.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sami people. The culture surrounding this industry is also important for many who make their living in other professions.
However, even from a traditional perspective, not all of the Sami people were involved in large-scale reindeer herding. They made a living from fishing, hunting, and similar activities, and usually kept the reindeer as draft animals.
Nowadays, many Saami people are involved in modern industries. Tourism is a major source of income for SÃ¡pmi, which is the Saami region.
Although the term "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Roma, it is generally considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Roma.
If the country you want to visit is subject to a travel warning, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the recommendations of governments other than your own, but their recommendations are made for their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different circumstances than those in Europe or the Arab world.
Travel advisories can only provide brief summaries of local situations.
Compared to the more detailed information provided elsewhere, the recommendations provided here are often rough, general, and overly simplistic.
Adverse weather is a general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon; such weather can cause damage, serious social disorder or loss of life.
Adverse weather can happen anywhere in the world. There are many different types of adverse weather, depending on geographic location, terrain, and atmospheric conditions.
Hurricanes, hailstorms, excessive rainfall, mountain fires, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, water spouts, and cyclones are all manifestations and effects of extreme weather.
Regional and seasonal adverse weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and sand and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the severe weather risks in their location, as they may affect travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that may be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
Search for "courses on how to deal with hostile environments" on the Internet, and you may find the address of a local company that provides training.
This course usually covers all the issues discussed here and is often in-depth and based on practical experience.
Course training usually lasts 2-5 days and involves role-playing, first aid training, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about survival in the wild are common, but there are few publications about survival in combat zones.
Travelers who plan to have a sex reassignment surgery abroad must carry valid identification when returning.
As for whether they want to issue passports without a gender marker (X) or change documents to match the desired name and gender, governments' willingness varies.
The level of recognition of these documents by foreign governments also varies widely.
In the post-September 11, 2001 era, security checkpoints have become even more of a hassle.
Transgender people who have not yet undergone surgery have to reveal their privacy when passing through the scanner, and cannot guarantee their dignity.
An offshore flow is a return flow of waves from the beach back to the sea, which usually occurs at a reef or similar location.
The underwater topography causes the backflow to concentrate in a few deeper areas, where there may be a rush of water flowing towards the deep water.
Most of the deaths were caused by swimming upstream and exhausting their physical strength, and swimming against the current was unlikely to be successful.
After getting through the turbulent water, it was not so difficult to swim back.
Try to swim to a place where you won't get stuck again, or wait for rescue (depending on your skills and whether you have been spotted).
The impact of returning home is faster (honeymoon period shorter), longer lasting, and possibly more severe than the impact of culture shock.
For travelers who easily adapt to new cultures, it can sometimes be difficult to re-adapt to their native culture.
After living abroad for a while, you will find that you have adapted to the new culture and have dropped some of your home culture's habits.
When you first arrive in a new country, people may be very patient and understanding, because they know that travelers need time to adjust to a new country.
One might not expect it, but travelers also need patience and understanding on the way back.
For children, the pyramid's sound and light show is one of the most interesting activities in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and before the show begins, you can see them standing there silently.
You can always hear the voices of tourists and street vendors here. The sounds blend together, like a touching story being told.
The backdrop is a lion-headed human figure, which is also the narrator of the long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramid, with different pyramids being lit up.
The South Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819. Several countries claim sovereignty over the islands, and the islands have the most bases, with 16 bases in use on the island in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the Antarctic Peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, where the settlement of "Villa Las Estrellas" is located.
Other features include Livinstone Island and Deception Island. There, a still active volcanic crater is submerged by floodwaters, providing a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is located in the southern part of the peninsula, facing the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains on the peninsula join the highlands here, then reform as the Ellsworth Mountains, which stretch for 360 kilometers. These mountains are divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the north, or rather, the Sentinel Range, the highest mountain range in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, is located, with its highest peak being Mount Vinson, which stands at 4,892 meters.
In remote areas where cell phone signals are not available, a satellite phone may be your only option.
In general, satellite phones cannot replace mobile phones because calls can only be made outdoors where satellite signals are available.
This service is commonly used in shipping, including yachts, as well as for expeditions that require remote data and voice capabilities.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with detailed information about connecting to this service.
For those who plan how to spend their gap years, studying abroad is becoming an increasingly popular option.
This is especially popular among high school graduates, who can take a year off before going to university without affecting their education.
In many cases, taking a gap year course abroad can substantially improve your chances of getting into a good university when you return home.
Normally, participation in these educational programs requires payment of tuition fees.
Finland is an ideal sailing destination, with the nickname "the land of a thousand lakes," and it has thousands of islands within its lakes and archipelagos along the coast.
In the archipelagos and lakes, yachts are not necessary.
The size of the coastal islands and the largest lakes is enough to accommodate any yacht, but even smaller boats and kayaks can provide a different experience.
Boat racing is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand also have similar situations, but they are unique in other ways (for example, in the Netherlands, this figure is one to forty).
Most typical Baltic cruises will spend a considerable amount of time in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can have several full days to visit this historic city, and then sleep on the ship at night.
If you are only landing to take a boat tour, you do not need a separate visa (as of the regulations in 2009).
Some cruise brochures advertise Berlin, Germany as a highlight. As can be seen from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and the cost of the cruise does not include the cost of visiting the city.
Flying can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
This is not a bad thing: it is not much different from the fear and disgust that many people feel about other things.
For some people, understanding how airplanes work and the procedures for flying can be helpful in overcoming fears that arise from the unknown or uncontrollable.
Courier companies can earn high rewards for fast delivery of goods. Time is often of the essence for business documents, goods, or parts used for urgent repairs.
On some routes, large companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, there is a problem.
If they use air transportation, it may take several days to unload and clear customs on some routes.
The fastest way is to have it carried as checked baggage. According to the airline's rules, luggage of passengers who have not boarded the plane is prohibited, and you will need to be present at this time.
The most obvious way to travel in first or business class is to pay a lot of money to enjoy this privilege (or, better yet, have your company pay for it).
However, this is not cheap: according to rough estimates, the price of a business class ticket may be four times that of a regular economy class ticket, and the price of a first class ticket is even 11 times higher!
In general, there is no need to look for discounted business or first class tickets when flying directly from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that some core customers are willing to pay a premium to enjoy the privilege of fast and comfortable travel, and so airlines charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic and has suffered greatly from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of Transnistria, a self-proclaimed republic in eastern Moldova. The republic has its own government and currency, but it has not been recognized by any United Nations member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between the two regions of Moldova were re-established.
The main religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox.
Izmir is Turkey's third largest city with a population of around 3.7 million. It is Turkey's second largest port, after Istanbul, and is also a busy transportation hub.
What was once the ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed and bustling commercial center surrounded by vast bays and mountains.
Between the wide tree-lined avenues, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centres, there are traditional red-tiled roofs, 18th-century markets and ancient mosques and churches. However, the city has a more Mediterranean European atmosphere than traditional Turkey.
In HaldarsvÃ­k, you can enjoy the beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy. The village has a unique octagonal church.
In the church cemetery, there are interesting marble pigeon sculptures placed on top of some graves.
It is worth walking around this charming village for half an hour.
To the north, you can easily reach the romantic and charming town of Sintra; it is the paradise praised by Lord Byron, and is therefore well known to foreigners.
The Scotturb 403 bus runs regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
You can also visit the Basilica of the Virgin Mary (a holy site) in the north, which is famous all over the world.
Remember that you are actually visiting a huge mass grave site that has an immeasurable significance to a large group of people in the world.
Still, many men and women survived here and are still alive today; and the relatives of many more were either slaughtered there or worked to death as forced laborers, both Jewish and non-Jewish.
Please give this place the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Don't joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not mark or graffiti on the buildings to avoid damaging the site.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the locals prefer to speak Catalan, and the vast majority of people understand Catalan. As for Spanish, almost everyone can understand it.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, as this is the first official language, as stipulated by law.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
The regular announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but the automatic system makes temporary announcements in several languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are notorious for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is usually just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to live in Paris is still to behave as well as possible and present yourself as someone with "bien Ã©levÃ©" (good manners). This will make participating in social activities much easier.
If you show a little basic courtesy, the rudeness of the Parisians will quickly disappear.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered in dense forest, with the main trees being beech, fir and spruce, and is characterised by a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to the diversity of microclimates, soils, and altitudes, the plant communities here are very rich and are famous throughout the world.
The region is also home to a variety of animals and birds.
Rare animals such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, buzzards, lynxes, wildcats, and turkey vultures, as well as many more common species, can be seen there.
Women must wear skirts that reach the knee and cover their shoulders when visiting the monastery.
Most monasteries will provide a robe for women who are not prepared, but if you bring your own, especially if it's brightly colored, the monk at the door will give you a wink and a smile.
Similarly, men must wear long pants that cover their knees.
You can also borrow them from the cloakroom at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after every use, so these dresses may feel a bit uncomfortable to wear. They are all one size, though!
The cuisine of Majorca is similar to that of other Mediterranean regions, based mainly on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and using olive oil exclusively.
Pa amb Oli is a simple dinner that is particularly popular in the summer: bread combined with olive oil and tomato, and any condiments you have on hand can be added, such as cheese or tuna.
All nouns that are not "Sie" should be capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important method for distinguishing certain verbs and objects.
This also makes reading easier, although it makes writing more complex to some extent, because you need to judge whether a verb or adjective is being used as a nominalized form.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy because the pronunciation and spelling of most words are the same.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, because their pronunciation is based on the following vowel changes.
Additionally, it is necessary to ensure that r and rr are pronounced differently: "caro" means "dear," while "carro" means "chariot."
Persian grammar is mostly relatively simple and follows rules.
Therefore, reading this grammar introduction book will help you master more Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
There is no doubt that if you speak one Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, anyone who knows a little bit of Spanish may be quick to conclude that Portuguese is very similar and doesn't require a separate study.
Nowadays, most of the former modern observatories have been decommissioned and only preserved as museums or educational venues.
Since light pollution was not as severe during its heyday, observatories were usually built in urban areas or on campuses, making them easier to access than modern observatories.
Most modern scientific telescopes are huge facilities located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, also known as "hanami," has been a Japanese custom since the 8th century.
This concept originated in China, and the plum blossom is a type of flower that the Chinese people love.
In Japan, the earliest cherry blossom parties were held by the emperor for himself and other members of the royal family at the imperial palace.
Plants are in the best state in their natural environment. Therefore, we must resist the temptation to pick them, even if it is "just one."
If you visit a beautifully landscaped garden, collecting "specimens" will also get you kicked out, with no room for negotiation.
Generally speaking, Singapore is a very safe place, and navigation is easy. Once you arrive, you can buy almost anything.
However, because it is located a few degrees north of the equator in the "high tropics," you will need to contend with both high heat (year-round) and strong sunlight (which is relatively rare on clear days).
Several buses also headed north to Hebron, where the traditional burial site of the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives is located in the Bible.
Please confirm that the bus you intend to take will enter Hebron and not just the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great theme for a holiday excursion.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, take a cruise to explore the fun cities along the Danube River, or take a boat trip along the Illyrian Canal.
They also marked out the route for popular walking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays, established to celebrate the birth of Christ.
Many traditions associated with this holiday are also embraced by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
One tradition is to wake up outside on Easter morning to watch the sunrise.
Of course, this tradition has its explanation in Christian theology, but it is likely that it was a ceremony to celebrate spring and pray for a bountiful harvest that existed before the birth of Christ.
More traditional churches often hold Easter Vigils on Saturday nights during Easter weekend, with congregants typically flooding in at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
Initially, animals arrived on these islands by swimming, flying, or floating.
Because they are far from the mainland and cannot travel long distances, mammals cannot come here, which makes the giant turtles the main herbivores of the Colon Island.
After humans arrived on the Galapagos Islands, they introduced many mammals, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you travel to the Arctic or Antarctic during winter, you can experience polar night, where the sun does not rise above the horizon for a period of time.
This provides an excellent opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark for most of the day.
These areas have a sparse population and generally do not have light pollution problems, so you can enjoy a dazzling starry sky.
Compared to the work culture that Westerners are accustomed to, the hierarchical system is more obvious and more formal in the work culture of the Japanese.
The suits are standard business attire, and colleagues call each other by their surnames or titles.
A harmonious workplace atmosphere is crucial, emphasizing team efforts rather than praising individual achievements.
Employees must obtain approval from their superiors for any decision they make and must unconditionally obey their superiors' instructions.
