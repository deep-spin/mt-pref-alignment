This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers - a theory that has been widely accepted - but also provides details that fossils usually cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the top of the bird's feathers are reddish brown, and the bottom is light or beetroot color.
This discovery also helps us to understand the evolution of bird feathers in depth.
The feathers of dinosaurs did not have a well-developed main shaft, which is called a "feather shaft", but they still had other features of feathers, such as feather branches and feather branches, and researchers speculate that the evolution of the feather shaft may be later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but for regulating temperature or displaying. Researchers believe that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows mature feathers, not juvenile feathers.
Researchers believe that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers, not downy feathers of a juvenile dinosaur.

In France, voting is traditionally an experience with little technological content: voters go into a small booth and put a pre-printed paper indicating the candidate they have chosen into an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter will put the envelope into the ballot box and sign the ballot book.
The French electoral law establishes a very strict legal framework for the electoral process.
Since 1988, the ballot box must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes in the box when voting begins, and that no one other than those who are eligible to vote and have been timely counted have put envelopes into the box.
Candidates can send representatives to observe every step of the election process on the spot. At night, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision according to a specific procedure.

However, 80% of our goods are subject to tariffs in Central American countries.
I think this is unreasonable; it is clearly unfair.
I say to people: how we treat you, you treat us.
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a bill banning the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.
The bill requires violent video games sold in California to be labeled with a "18" rating, and retailers who violate the law by selling them to minors will be fined $1,000.
The Attorney General and Solicitor General of the Royal Family, Kier Starmer, announced this morning that he would prosecute Huna and Ples.
Hoon has resigned and his position in the cabinet will be taken over by MP Ed Davey. It is expected that MP Norman Lamb will take over the vacant position of Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills.
Hoon and Price will appear in Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16.
The victims were 25-year-old Nicholas Alden and 21-year-old Zachary Cuddeback. Cuddeback was driving the car at the time.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and chin, while Kristoffer Schneider needed facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's weapon malfunctioned when it was pointed at the fifth person. Schneider was in agony, with one eye blinded and a missing piece of skull, and it was only with the help of titanium plates that he was able to reconstruct his face.
Schneider testified via video link from his home country's US Air Force base.
In addition to the competition on Wednesday, Carpanedo also participated in two individual competitions in the championship.
Her first project was obstacle skiing, and she finished the competition in the first round with a score of "not completed".
Her other race was the women's 100m backstroke, where she placed 10th with a total time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the Austrian winner Claudia Rosch and 1:09.02 minutes behind the Hungarian winner Krisztina Danyi.
Four female skiers in the sitting group failed to finish the race, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom event failed to make the podium.
The Central Bureau of Investigation has recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped this Swiss woman and found her mobile phone and laptop."
The defendants' names are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the defendants covered their faces when they appeared in court.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car hit it, no one was injured in the end.
However, the driver's head was severely injured.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed, and emergency rescue personnel pulled the driver out of the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was taken to the James Peebles Hospital in Great Yarmouth for treatment.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Afterwards, Adcock was charged with murdering her son and was tried at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She has been detained, awaiting prosecution and trial; however, any witness's evidence may be negatively affected because her image has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scotland's legal system is different, and the court believes that publishing the photos could cause potential harm.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee said: "There does seem to be a danger if journalists publish information such as photos of suspects."
The Royal Prosecution Service, the main department responsible for prosecution, told reporters that it would not release any further comments until the prosecution was initiated.
It was revealed that the document will mention the border dispute, and Palestine hopes to base it on the border before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics reportedly discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands that military forces be deployed in the central part of the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian National Authority only agrees to retain them for five years.
The forest rangers closely monitor the shooters who participate in the supplementary trials for pest control, because the trials are monitored and their effectiveness is evaluated.
In cooperation with the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the Australian Shooting Sports Association (NSW), the shooting sports association has recruited qualified volunteers for the hunting program.
Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) in New South Wales, Australia, said that the four shooters who participated in the first shooting operation have all received comprehensive safety and training guidance.
Yesterday, Martelli took the oath of office in the new provisional electoral commission (CEP), which is made up of nine members.
This is the fifth time that Martelly has been elected to the Haitian Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) in the past four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP, which is part of the push to move the country towards new electoral measures.
The committee was Martelly's response to the large-scale anti-government protests that began in October.
Since 2011, these protests have been triggered by the failure to hold some elections on time, and sometimes they have escalated into violent incidents.
According to reports, there were about 60 cases of iPod malfunctions and overheating, resulting in 6 fires and 4 people suffering minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan said that they have noticed 27 accidents related to the device.
Last week, the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had reported 34 more incidents of overheating to the ministry, although the company said these incidents were "not serious".
The Economic Affairs Bureau responded that Apple's delay in releasing the report was "very regrettable".
The Mariana Islands experienced an earthquake at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
The Office of Emergency Management of Northern Mariana Islands said that no disaster losses were reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that no tsunami signs were found.
A former Philippine police officer hijacked a tourist bus in the capital Manila and took Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza set up his M16 rifle and fired at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six hostages have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, and some Filipino photographers were released early.
The two photographers then replaced an elderly woman who needed to use the bathroom, while Mendoza was killed.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career as a doctor.
He was trained as an obstetrician and worked at the Auckland National Women's Hospital from 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature births in his spare time.
His research shows that the application of hormones can accelerate the maturation of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators found two "black boxes" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy said, "Luna was the first queen, my first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the full moon. This night is as special as she was. She was a strong woman."
Dustin Runnels (aka Goldust) commented, "Luna is as hard to figure out as I am... She might be even harder to figure out... I love her and I miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
A survey of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal election found that the number of people who opposed Australia becoming a republic had grown by 8% since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, the acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said she believed that Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's abdication.
34% of respondents unanimously expressed their desire for Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom to be the last monarch of Australia.
The poll shows a polarized situation, with 29% of respondents believing that Australia should establish a republic as soon as possible, and 31% believing that Australia should never establish a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to participate in the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle and Commonwealth Games relay, but his health has been questioned due to his complaints.
He has been unable to use medication to relieve his pain, as the competition prohibits participants from taking these drugs.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
In early February, several people confirmed this discovery using different hardware and software, and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may be the source of water and organic matter on Earth, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists want to know how planets, especially the Earth, formed since the collision between comets and the Earth a long time ago.
The 53-year-old Cuomo has been governor since the beginning of this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors "political nonsense and foolish behavior."
It is estimated that he will run for president in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said that the NextGen air transport system can shorten flight routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, rather than old-fashioned ground radar technology, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There are no additional transportation tools, and the train does not stop at Wembley. There are no parking lots or parking and transfer facilities on the ground.
Due to concerns about a lack of transportation, the match may be forced to take place behind closed doors without the support of any team's fans.
On Thursday, a research report published in the journal Science said that a new bird species has formed in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that due to the reproduction between the local Darwin finches and the introduced cactus finches, this new species has only evolved for two generations, although people believe that this process takes longer.
Gold can be processed into various shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into thin threads, used for braiding and knotting. It can also be beaten or crushed into a flat shape.
It can be made very thin and stick to other metals. Because it is so thin, it can sometimes be used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH value of a chemical substance. You can use red cabbage juice to make an indicator.
The color of the kale juice will change depending on the acidity of the chemical substance.
The pH value is represented by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost an electron (because hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Stir the two powders together, then use clean wet hands to knead them into a ball.
The water on your hands will react with the outer layer, forming a layer that is similar to a shell, which feels very interesting.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every household had a flush toilet, which was connected to a sophisticated sewage treatment system.
The ruins of a sewage system have been found in houses on the Greek island of Crete and in the city of Santorini.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were always part of public bathhouses that were mixed for men and women.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
When a satellite in space receives a call, it almost immediately reflects it back.
Satellites are launched into space by rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere causes some light and vision to be distorted.
To send a satellite or telescope into space, a giant rocket over 100 feet tall is needed.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest contribution of the wheel to us is to make our transportation more convenient.
It is what gave us trains, cars, and many other forms of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits and deer to deer.
In the end, many small carnivores (including pet cats that are allowed to roam free) feed on a much larger variety of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a "litter", where each cat is responsible for a specific task, preventing them from competing with other cats.
Lions are the most social of all cats, living in large groups called prides.
A pride of lions is made up of one to three adult males that are related, as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
As sisters and daughters in a large family, females are usually very close to each other.
The behavior of a lion pride is very similar to that of a wolf or dog pack. These animals are remarkably similar in their behavior to lions (but not to other large cats), and their behavior is also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is an all-round athlete, it can climb (although its climbing ability is not very strong), swim, jump, and its pulling force can be five times that of a human strongman.
Tigers, lions, panthers, and jaguars are all in the same family (Panthera). These four big cats are the only cats in the family that roar.
The roar of a tiger is not as deep as that of a lion, but more like a word of anger.
Jaguars like to eat small animals. If conditions allow, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. The prey of jaguars is almost always much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that the jaguar tracks and hunts its prey by smell and sniffing out its trail on the ground.
They have strong night vision, can see clearly in the dark, and their movements are very secretive. The hunting method of the leopard is to first blend in with the surrounding environment, and then rush towards its prey.
When a small group of organisms (a subpopulation) separates from their original main population (e.g. they cross mountains and rivers, or they reach a new island where it is impossible to go back), they usually find that their environment is different from before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new populations will need different characteristics or adaptive abilities to become a strong competitor, rather than what they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, and they still need to adapt to the environment as before.
Over time, new populations begin to adapt to their new environment, and they start to become more and more different from other populations.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear to be completely different, to the point that they cannot be considered the same species.
We call this process "species formation", which is the formation of new species. Species formation is an inevitable result of evolution and is a very important part of evolution.
Plants can produce oxygen that humans can inhale and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants obtain nutrients from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build houses with plants, we make clothes with plants. Most of the food we eat is plant-based. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Qionglong was the top predator of that era, and it was not afraid of anything except its own kind.
Its lower jaw is covered in over 70 razor-sharp teeth, with another row on its upper jaw. This means that anything that comes into contact with it has no escape.
Its tongue is likely to be forked, which we are not sure about. Its diet includes sea turtles, large fish, other plesiosaurs, and even humans.
It will attack anything that enters the water; even giant dinosaurs like the T-Rex are not its match.
Although most of the Romans' food is familiar to us, they did have some strange or unusual dishes at their banquets, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a rodent called the dormouse.
Another difference is that the poor and women sit on chairs to eat, while the rich like to gather together for a banquet and eat while lying down.
Foods that were introduced to Europe from the Americas or Asia several centuries ago are unlikely to appear in the diet of the ancient Romans.
For example, they have no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no Roman has ever eaten chicken.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which they considered to be their residence.
People will offer sacrifices to the gods, and priests will satisfy the needs of the gods through rituals and festivals.
Every temple has an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests can enter.
Some special towers are pyramidal in shape and are called pyramid-shaped temples. They were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower is a special holy place of God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house is not that important.
The lives of Hebrew families were mostly spent outdoors.
Women cook in the courtyard; the shops are actually open counters facing the street. They use stones to build houses.
Canaan has no large forests, so timber is very expensive.
The people of Greenland are few in number. According to the Norse epic Saga of the Sagas, Eric the Red, who was expelled from Iceland for committing murder, sailed west and discovered land, which he named Greenland.
But whether he found it or not, the Esquimaux were already living there.
Although they are all part of “Scandinavia”, there are many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence is painted with a treasure map.
However, this is not the case. Although the back of this document is written with something, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence is inscribed with the words “Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776” in reverse.
Although no one knows who the author was, this large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was allegedly rolled up and stored when it was first written.
Therefore, it is likely that this symbol was added as a label.
The Normandy landings and the subsequent fighting liberated northern France, but the south remained unliberated.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French, who made a peace agreement with the Germans in 1940 and did not resist the invaders, but instead cooperated with them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, and this attack was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the American and Free French armies liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a group of people (society) who live together and work together.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis" (meaning "of the citizens"), which is related to the Latin "civis" (meaning "citizen") and "civitas" (meaning "city" or "city-state"), which also in some way defines the scale of society.
The city-state is the ancestor of the nation. Civilized culture means the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, the footprints of culture remain, and culture can be fairly transmitted.
Minority cultures often disappear without a trace, without leaving any historical evidence, and are not considered to be a civilization.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government under the Federal Regulations (the Congress was its only component).
The National Assembly does not have the power to levy taxes, and because there is no national administrative or judicial authority, the National Assembly can only rely on state governments to enforce all laws, but state governments often do not cooperate.
It also has no power to overturn state tax and tariff laws.
These provisions must be agreed upon by all states before they can be amended, and states have been very dismissive of the central government, with their state representatives often absent.
The Italian national football team and the German national football team are the second most successful teams in the world, having won the football World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu Island), making it the seventh largest island country in the world!
Because Japan has many islands, Japan is often called an archipelago from a geological perspective
Western knowledge of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by named the island “Ilha Formosa”, which means beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, and began to change the food production methods of the indigenous people, and hired Chinese workers to work in its rice and sugar cane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) controlled the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, the Qing Empire declared the establishment of a province in Taiwan.
In 1895, after being defeated in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, and Japan ruled Taiwan until 1945.
The ancient city of Machu Picchu is made up of three main buildings: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Windows House.
In order to allow tourists to better understand the original appearance of the building group, most of the buildings on the edge of the building group have been rebuilt.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work has continued to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm format, which was the dominant film size at the end of the film era.
Production still continues today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been applied to the format of digital camera image sensors.
The actual size of the 35 mm format is 36 mm wide and 24 mm high, which is a bit confusing.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (obtained by dividing by 12) is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format series) have the same or a similar aspect ratio.
The three-point rule, which is often abused and ridiculed, is a simple guideline when creating dynamic images, and it can also keep the image orderly.
It points out that the most effective location for the subject is the intersection point of the lines dividing the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was closely monitored.
Although the languages and customs of European countries are different, Christianity has connected them for more than a thousand years.
From the king to the common people, it permeates the power of the ten directions and influences everyone.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's money funds are set up specifically for this purpose.
The centralized power of the church in Rome existed for more than a thousand years, and the concentration of power and money began to raise questions for many people, whether they adhered to this creed.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, the British began to impose a naval blockade on Germany.
They cut off the supply of military and civilian goods that are vital to life. This strategy has proven to be effective, although such a blockade violates the generally accepted international law established by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
The United Kingdom laid mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire sea area, even threatening neutral countries' ships.
Because the response to this strategy is limited, Germany hopes that its unrestricted submarine war will also have a similar response.
In the 1920s, the mainstream attitude of most citizens was pacifist and separatist.
After witnessing the devastation and brutality of the First World War, countries all over the world are eager to avoid repeating the same mistakes.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and accepted a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
When he arrived in the United States, he had 4 cents, a collection of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) to Thomas Edison.
Each period in ancient China had its own characteristics; each period in China or each family that ruled the world was a dynasty with its own distinctive characteristics.
Likewise, the period of small country division during the succession of dynasties has been an unstable period in every dynasty. The most famous one is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years and was between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these turbulent times, various lords fought fiercely for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people died fighting for the highest power in the luxurious palace of Xi'an.
There are also many social and political influences, such as the use of measurement units, the transition from autocracy to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people rather than to a single ruler.
In addition, after the revolution, the post was open to all men, which gave the most ambitious and successful people the opportunity to rise to the top.
The same goes for the military, because the rank of an officer is no longer based on their rank, but on their abilities.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working class in many other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond the worldly life. He used to go to a cave called "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself not only withstood the test of time and remained intact, but also gave a vivid image of the spiritual intentions of Muhammad.
The cave is located on the top of a mountain in the north of Mecca, completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, even if you know it exists, it's not easy to find. Once you enter the cave, you are completely cut off from the world.
Apart from the clear and beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains, nothing else can be seen. In the cave, you can hardly see or hear anything from the outside.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid is a masterpiece of the Egyptians in the third century BC, and it is one of the many large pyramids that pay tribute to the deceased pharaohs.
The Giza plateau in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt (i.e. the "Giza pyramid complex") includes several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several smaller tombs, several temples, and several sphinxes.
The Great Pyramid was built to commemorate Pharaoh Hoeph, and several smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to commemorate Hoeph's wife and family members.
The "draw bow" symbol looks like the letter V, and the "draw arrow" symbol looks like a nail or a square without a bottom edge.
Pointing up means starting from the top to draw the bow, and pointing down means starting from the bottom of the bow (i.e. where the bow is held).
The upper bow usually produces a softer sound, while the lower bow produces a stronger, more determined sound.
Please feel free to use a pencil to make your own markings, but remember that the printed notes are musically significant, so they should usually be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis Charles), as well as the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were chased back to Paris by a group of market women from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, and a group of people surrounded them, shouting and threatening the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to fully open the windows of their carriage.
In front of the terrified queen, a rioter once waved the head of a royal guard, who was killed in the Palace of Versailles.
The war expenses of the United States in conquering the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They are forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of their expenses, as well as interest on bonds issued by the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the high profits obtained by long-term exploitation of the Filipino people have become the basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the background that led to the formation of the Knights Templar.
The time of the events is usually referred to as the medieval peak of European history, i.e. the period from the 11th to the 13th century (AD 1000-1300).
The period before the Middle Ages was the Early Middle Ages, and the period after was the Late Middle Ages, which is commonly believed to have ended around 1500.
The technological determinism is a term that encompasses many ideas in practice, including the technological determinism, the technological necessity, and a strict definition - the fate of human beings is driven by the logic behind the scientific laws and its manifestation in technology.
Most explanations of technological determinism include these two general ideas: first, the development of technology itself has largely transcended cultural or political influence, and second, technology, in turn, has an inherent “influence” on society that is not constrained by social conditions.
For example, someone might say that cars will necessarily promote the development of roads.
However, building a national road network for a few cars is not economically feasible, so a new production method was born to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The high number of Volkswagen cars on the road also leads to a higher rate of road traffic accidents, which will drive the development of new medical technologies for treating injuries.
Romanticism has a strong cultural determinism color. This is due to writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and as time passed, geographically related customs and cultures emerged. These customs and cultures are much better than any imposed laws because they are in harmony with the place where society is located.
Just as Paris is called the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of the European feudal era.
Its reputation as a center for luxury goods began around the year 400 and continued until around the year 1100.
Its status declined in the 12th century, mainly because the gifts brought back by the Crusaders, such as silk and spices, were more valuable than those available in the Byzantine market.
It was at this time that the title of the capital of fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak from the 10th to 11th centuries to the 14th century.
Initially, the dress was deeply influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to the slow pace of cultural exchange, Western fashion may be 25 to 30 years behind.
As the Middle Ages came to an end, the people of Western Europe gradually developed their own style. One of the biggest advances at the time was when people began using buttons to fasten their clothes after the Crusades.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agricultural activities carried out to produce food that can only meet the needs of farmers and their families.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple and usually organic system that uses local seeds stored in the ecological zone, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture. This is still the case in many developing countries today.
Yavin Culture brings like-minded individuals together, and these people feel that they are ignored by social standards. Yavin Culture cultivates a sense of belonging among them.
Given the differences in age, race, class, location, and/or gender among members, subcultures may vary.
The qualities that make Asian culture different from others may be a combination of language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, geography, or multiple factors.
Members of subcultures often use unique styles of behavior, including fashion, mannerisms, and slang, to symbolize their membership.
One of the most common ways to explain the importance of socialization is to use the case of a few unfortunate children. These children, due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, have not been able to achieve socialization with the help of adults in their growth process.
Such children are called "wild children", meaning wild children. Some wild children are imprisoned by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, children are abandoned because their parents refuse to accept that they have serious intellectual or physical disabilities.
Before being abandoned or running away from home, feral children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma.
It is said that others are raised by animals; some people live alone in the wild.
If a wolf child is raised entirely by non-human animals, its behavior (to the extent that its physical condition allows) will be very similar to that of the animal, such as showing fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more fun, the scaffolding method goes even further.
The crutch method is not a learning method, but a tool to help people who are just learning to use new computer programs or start new projects.
Framework teaching can be done online or offline, in other words, teachers are a form of framework teaching, just like the Clippy assistant in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is embedded in software to challenge, prompt, and explain procedures that may be difficult for students to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment without discipline, love, and education, but that is what happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The foster care system should provide everything that the child's original family lacks.
The Internet combines the elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet add an extra dimension to its uses and ways of satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are considered important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
In studying the audience's response to the website, Ajzen and Fishbein (1998) also included "personal involvement" and "continuous relationship" as new motivational factors.
The use of video has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions (facial movements lasting a few milliseconds).
Specifically, it is said that one can judge whether someone is lying by correctly interpreting their micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay "The President's Speech," points out that people who have suffered brain damage and cannot understand language can still accurately judge whether the speaker is sincere.
He even suggests that this ability to understand human behavior may be a common trait of animals such as dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that genetic variation has two types of pools: apparent and hidden.
Mutations add new genetic variations, while selection removes variations from the pool of expressed genetic variations.
Due to separation and recombination, variation moves back and forth between the two pools in each generation.
In the tropical grasslands, primates have a digestive system similar to humans, and the existing plant resources are difficult to meet the amino acid needs of primates.
Furthermore, failure to do so will have serious consequences: growth inhibition, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest plant resources to obtain are leaves and proteins from legumes, but it is difficult for primates like us to digest these proteins unless they are cooked.
In comparison, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide a large amount of protein, and contain all the necessary amino acids.
In summary, if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in the same way as the black monkeys on the tropical savannah today, we should not be surprised.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep and falling back asleep within a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This is easy to do, using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm clock while you're sleeping, you can put the clock on the other side of the room to force yourself out of bed to turn it off.
Other biological rhythm-based options include drinking a large amount of liquid before bedtime (especially water or tea, which is known to have diuretic effects), and forcing oneself to urinate.
The degree of calmness in one's heart is inversely proportional to the degree of tension in the body and mind.
The less pressure, the more active the vitality. Everyone has the potential to find absolute calmness and satisfaction.
Everyone can reach the state of enlightenment, and the only obstacle to achieving it is our own tension and negative emotions.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been expanded through the universal love of Mahayana Buddhism and the many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the method of universal love.
In Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (enlightening energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visual images.
The core activity of Tibetan meditation is Tien Yoga. By transforming different deities into energy channels, activating acupoints, and achieving enlightenment.
Germany was the common enemy of all countries during World War II, which promoted cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. As the war came to an end, conflicts in terms of institutions, procedures, and culture caused the two countries to part ways.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
This war lasted for 40 years, and the proxy army fought in many battlefields from Africa to Asia, including Afghanistan and Cuba.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had been breached, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize the army along the Romanian bastion.
However, these plans were almost abandoned overnight, as the Soviet Union invaded the eastern part of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties. More than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops entered the country and established a foothold in Belarus and Ukraine.
So far, shipping is the most effective way to transport large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
In the traditional sense, the Navy's mission is to ensure that the country maintains the ability to transport people and goods, while disrupting the enemy's ability to transport their people and goods.
One of the most noteworthy modern examples is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans tried to cross the Atlantic to transport people and materials to help the British.
At the same time, the German navy, which relied on U-boats, tried to intercept this transport.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would have probably conquered Britain just as it conquered the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient civilizations and tribes began to domesticate them, eating and using their milk, meat, fur, and skin.
The family sheep are usually herded in groups on the mountains or other pastures, usually under the care of shepherds (mostly children or teenagers), who are similar to the more well-known shepherds. These methods of herding are still in use today.
The United Kingdom built truck lanes as early as the 16th century.
Although the Malayan sled was made of parallel wooden planks, at the time, these sleds could make the horses pulling them run faster and carry more, which was a bit of a challenge on the roads.
The railroad tie was introduced very early on to fix the rails. However, people gradually realized that if you put iron plates on the rails, the rails would be more stable and effective.
This became the general practice, but the iron plates would cause more severe wear on the wooden wheels of the cart.
In the end, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron track was born.
The first known mode of transportation is walking. 2 million years ago, with the appearance of Homo Erectus, humans began to walk upright.
Their ancestors, the southern apes, did not have the habit of standing upright and walking.
The phenomenon of bipedalism was found in the fossils of ancient apes in the south between 4.2 million and 3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 70 million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, join environmental movements, and even become environmental activists, which can reduce the disasters in the future to a certain extent.
In many cases, this is similar to symptomatic treatment. However, if we want more than just a temporary solution, we should find the root cause of the problem and eradicate it completely.
It is clear that, due to human scientific and technological progress, the world has undergone great changes, and the problem has become more serious due to overpopulation and the luxurious lifestyle of human beings.
The handwritten draft, signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was approved by the Continental Congress on July 4 and was then sent to the John Dunlap Printing Company, located a few blocks away, for printing.
They printed 150 to 200 copies overnight, which is now known as the "Dunlap broadsides" version.
On July 8, John Nixon first publicly read the document in the courtyard of the Independence Hall.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, and Washington read the letter to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy of the letter arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 remaining copies of the Dunlap broadsides are the earliest versions of the document that have survived. The original manuscript has not survived.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and have continued to exist to this day, which is what we call "birds".
Many people believe that they are not dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds still have many places in common with dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs, and walk on two legs like the T-Rex.
Today, almost all computers in use are based on processing binary code information.
Binary numbers can only take one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or bits, in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not immediately appear, and symptoms such as vomiting are very common, so a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The most powerful indication of the ingestion of poison is a container that has been opened on the scene and contains drugs or household toxic chemicals.
Check the label on the poison for specific first aid instructions.
Entomologists use the word "bug" to formally refer to this type of insect.
This term comes from people's familiarity with the smell of maggots, which are a type of insect that is very adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both the bedbug and the cockroach are nesting insects that are adapted to living in the nests or homes of their hosts.
There are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in various regions of the United States, and this disease has become the main neurological disease of middle-aged people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system (composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves).
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis (MS).
A couple may decide not to have children for their own benefit or for the benefit of their children.
These couples may have adoption plans for their children.
In the adoption process, the biological parents terminate their rights as parents, so that another couple can raise the child.
The main purpose of science is to find out how the world works through scientific methods. In fact, this method can provide guidance for most scientific research.
An experiment is an experiment that eliminates one or more possible hypotheses, but an experiment is not the only way. Asking questions and making observations can also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers are interested in classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
The views of Aristotle on all scientific fields, including psychology, were accepted.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West was cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the physiological and behavioral rhythms observed by researchers are often heavily dependent on the endogenous cycles generated by the biological clock and their existence.
The cyclical rhythm is not just a simple response to external cyclical signals. This rhythm is recorded in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-maintaining oscillator that continues to operate freely for a period of time even in the absence of external cues.
The experiments of Hershey and Chase demonstrated that DNA is one of the main indicators of genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, one using radioactive phosphorus to label the bacteriophage's DNA and the other using radioactive sulfur to label the bacteriophage's protein.
Mutations can have a wide range of effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are reproductive cells.
Only mutations in reproductive cells are passed on to children, while mutations in other cells can lead to cell death or cancer.
Natural scenery tourism attracts visitors who are interested in natural areas, and they come to admire the natural scenery, including wild animals.
On-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits, and ecosystem research.
For example, visit, shoot and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of the small town to go to work, and the places where the people they pass on the road work are the places they leave.
In this dynamic traffic commute, everyone is connected to and supports the traffic system based on private cars in some way.
Now, science has shown that this large-scale carbon economy can no longer maintain the stability of the ecosystem that has supported human evolution for the past 2 million years.
Everyone is a part of society and will use the transportation system. Almost everyone has complaints about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about the quality of water or the extent of bridge collapses.
Why does the transportation system cause such complaints? Why do they break down every day? Is it because the transportation engineers are not doing their job well? Or is there a more fundamental reason?
Traffic flow studies are concerned with the movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because we cannot make 100% accurate predictions about the behavior of drivers.
Fortunately, the driver's behavior is usually within a reasonable consistency range; therefore, traffic flow often has a certain reasonable consistency, which can be roughly expressed in mathematical terms.
In order to better represent traffic flow, a relationship was established between the following three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships are helpful in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects are the earliest animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly makes it easier for them to evade enemies and more effectively find food and mates.
Most insects have an advantage in that they can fold their wings along their body.
This gives them more small areas to hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings backward are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people think he is right, but there are also many people who disagree; they believe that the solar system revolves around the Earth, and the Sun does too (even other stars do).
This seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. Its water volume is more than 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with some sections as wide as 6 miles.
The Amazon River accounts for 20% of all the world's river flow into the sea.
The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. The river water comes from thousands of smaller tributaries.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the grand scale and advanced construction technology of the Giza pyramids have never been surpassed.
The people of ancient Egypt during the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which had a history of more than a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and also the country with the fewest people.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its laws, regulations, and official communications.
Italian is also the language most people working in the country use on a daily basis, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because these elements can be found in their natural form in the natural world and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that any object is made up of one or more of the four elements of earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like the four states of matter (in order of solid, liquid, gas, and plasma), but he also proposed a theory that they will transform into new matter and form the things we see.
Alloys are basically made up of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Calcium, potassium, and other elements are metals, and silver and gold are of course metals as well.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements (such as carbon).
Everything in the universe is made up of matter, and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that the period at the end of this sentence can contain billions of atoms.
Therefore, when the pencil was first invented, it became the darling of many people.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods have emerged, the status of the pencil has become lower and its use has become less frequent.
People are now writing information on computer screens, and they never have to touch pens and paper.
People can only guess what the keyboard's fate will be when the updated product appears.
The principle of fission atomic bomb is as follows: it takes energy to bring a nucleus and many protons and neutrons together.
It's a bit like pushing a heavy little cart up a hill. It splits the atomic nucleus again, and then releases some energy.
Some atoms contain unstable atomic nuclei, which means that they are likely to split under little or no stimulation.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick near the surface and about 100 kilometers thick at the far end.
The crust under the dark side is thinner, and the crust under the highlands is thicker.
Because the crust is thinner, the near side may have more dark areas, and lava is more likely to rise to the surface.
The core of the content theory of motivation is to find factors that people can identify with or are interested in.
These theories suggest that as people mature to a certain degree, certain needs and/or desires are internalized.
These theoretical studies explain why some people want to do what they do and what in their environment causes them to do or not do certain things.
The two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, when managers start leading former colleagues, two behaviors occur. One is that they will try to maintain a "close relationship" with team members.
It is difficult for managers of this type to make unpopular decisions, and they also face difficulties in implementing disciplinary measures, performance assessment, allocation of responsibilities, and accountability.
In another extreme case, this person becomes a completely different individual from before, feeling that he/she must change everything the team does and take credit for the results.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams need to maintain the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the point of contact for their corresponding offline team.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their team may schedule meetings at different times zones, which the local management may not understand.
The existence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" refers to the management team that each member reports to. It sets standards for all members.
Why does an organization take so long to establish a learning organization? One of the goals of putting the concept of organizational learning into practice is innovation.
Creativity and originality occur when all available resources are effectively utilized among the functional departments of an organization.
Therefore, an organization, in the process of working together to overcome obstacles, often brings new innovative processes to meet the needs of customers.
Before an organization can innovate, leaders must create a culture of innovation, share knowledge, and engage in organized learning.
"Angels" (2006) explains the continuous improvement approach as a way to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neuroscience data provides physical evidence for the theoretical methods of cognitive research. Therefore, it narrows the scope of research and makes it more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior can provide support for scientists' research.
We have known for a long time that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors can affect a person's behavior and cause certain cognitive functions to change.
The rise of new technologies has allowed us to see and study the structure and workings of the brain, which we have never seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to build a simulation model, which helps us understand the process of brain operation.
Artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction flavor, but it is actually a very important branch of computer science, which studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
The study of artificial intelligence (AI) involves the creation of machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnosis and customer problems, handwriting recognition, voice and facial recognition.
All of these have become independent disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to problems in real life.
Artificial intelligence systems are now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, and some home computers and electronic game software applications have built-in artificial intelligence systems.
Field trips are an important part of any teaching activity. Usually, teachers are happy to take students to places that buses cannot reach.
Virtual field trips are a high-tech solution. Students can watch museum artifacts in class, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art.
Sharing the field trip virtually is also a good way to review the itinerary and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned every year, but the old versions are kept online as a scrapbook.
Blogging can also help students improve their writing skills. Although students often start blogging with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of readers usually changes this.
Students are often the most discerning readers, so bloggers begin to strive to improve their writing skills to avoid criticism.
In addition, writing blogs also "forces students to have a better understanding of the world around them." In order to meet the interests of the audience, students are encouraged and become smart and interesting.
Writing a blog is a tool that can stimulate cooperation and encourage students to extend their learning beyond traditional classroom teaching.
"Appropriate use of blogs can make students better at analyzing and reasoning; through active responses to online materials, students can find their own position in the context of others' articles and can put forward their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the capital of Canada, a charming city that uses a bilingual system, and is notable for a series of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south is Niagara Falls, and to the north is the Muskoka River and the unspoiled natural beauty across the river.
All of these things make Ontario the quintessential image of Canada that outsiders imagine.
Further north, the vast areas are sparsely populated, and some places are barren wildernesses with no human presence.
A striking comparison of population data: the number of African Americans living in the United States is greater than the number of Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is currently the largest island, and it is still a separate continent for wild animals.
The smaller islands are mostly independent countries or belong to France, and they are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to this land, and this doctrine is prevalent in the Comoros and Mayotte countries.
The influence and colonization of Europe began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape of Good Hope route from Europe to India.
It is bordered by the Sahel region to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female tourists, regardless of their actual marital status, should say that they are married.
Wearing a ring can also be helpful (but don't wear a ring that looks too expensive.
Women should be aware that cultural differences may lead to what they perceive as harassment; and being followed, grabbed, etc. is not uncommon.
When rejecting a man, be firm and don't be afraid to stick to your position (regardless of cultural differences, you must resolutely reject him!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it, naming it Casa Branca, until they abandoned it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya. Spanish merchants established a trading base here and named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring shopping destinations in all of Morocco.
In the old city of Medina, shops selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, and water pipes, as well as various small trinkets, can be found everywhere, but these shops are all aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located on the easternmost edge of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano. The volcanic lava buried most of the town's streets, especially the town center.
Although Goma is still considered safe, anyone traveling to any place outside of Goma should investigate in advance to see if the ongoing fighting in North Kivu has subsided.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking project in Africa.
You can take a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to explore Goma. The normal (local) price for a short trip is 500 Congolese francs.
Because it is relatively remote, "Tibet" is used to describe a distant foreign country.
Today, although Tinbaktoo has become a tourist destination due to its fame, and there is an airport, it is a poor town.
In 1990, it was listed as a World Heritage Site in danger due to the threat of the desert.
This is an important stop for Henry Louis Gates in the special program "The Wonders of the African World" on the American Public Broadcasting Service.
This city stands in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it is more Arabic in style than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, providing support for different wild plants and animals.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship attraction of the South African National Parks (SANParks) system.
Like all South African national parks, the park charges an entrance fee and a conservation fee every day.
Buying a Wild Card also has many benefits. With this card, you can enter some parks in South Africa or all national parks.
Hong Kong Island is a synonym for Hong Kong and is the focus of many tourists.
The many buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline are like a flashing bar graph, especially when they are reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
If you want to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, you can leave the island and head to the opposite side of Kowloon Waterfront.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land on the north shore.
This is where the British colonizers occupied, so if you want to find evidence of the colonial history of this territory, this is a good starting point.
Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove forest, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. This part of the forest in India is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, these forests are not just mangrove forests, but also the remains of some vast forests that once covered the entire Plain of Henghe.
The area of Sun Deberl is 3850 square kilometers, of which about one third is water/swamp area.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary. It is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 deer living in the area.
Buses run from the city center to the intercity bus station (across the river) all day, but most buses, especially those heading to the east and Jharkhand/Bhumangar, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Due to the high demand for the shuttle bus, it is recommended to purchase tickets a few days in advance.
Most areas have comfortable and sturdy Japanese Coaster buses.
If you want to go to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punaka (Nu 200), shared taxis are a convenient and comfortable way to go.
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects Oyapock, Brazil, with Saint George, French Guiana.
The two towers of the bridge are 83 meters high, and the length of the bridge is 378 meters, with two 3.50-meter-wide lanes.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The project was completed in August 2011, but it was not until March 2017 that it was opened to traffic.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, at which time the Brazilian customs inspection station is also expected to be completed.
The Guarani people are the most important indigenous group living in the current Paraguay region. They live a semi-nomadic hunting life and also engage in self-sufficient agricultural activities.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who make their living through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay was called the "Great Indian Province", which was the result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a three-century colonial period.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has always tried to preserve the many indigenous characteristics and features of the city.
Argentina is famous for having the world's top polo teams and players.
The largest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
On other days throughout the year, there are also smaller tournaments and competitions here.
For information on the tournament and how to buy tickets for the horse racing, please visit the Argentine Horse Racing Association website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound, which is equivalent to the British Pound.
You can exchange currency at the island's only bank, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The pound is generally accepted everywhere on the island, and credit cards and dollars are often accepted in Stanley.
On the outer islands, credit cards may not be accepted, but British and American currencies are accepted; please contact the landlord in advance to confirm the acceptable payment methods.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so it must be exchanged before leaving the islands.
Montpellier is located south of the equator, so during the winter in the northern hemisphere, it is summer there, and vice versa.
Montpellier is located in the subtropical region; in the summer months, the temperature often exceeds 30°C.
Winter may feel colder than it looks: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but when wind and humidity combine, it can feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There is no specific "rainy season" and "dry season" here: the rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to humans, wild animals are still wild animals, and we should not feed or disturb them.
The park's management said that you should keep at least 100 feet/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 feet/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how gentle they may appear, bison, elk, deer, bears, and almost all large animals are capable of attacking humans.
Every year, dozens of tourists are injured because they fail to maintain proper distance. These animals are large and wild, and have potential dangers, so please give them some space.
In addition, bears and other wild animals are attracted to smells, so avoid carrying or cooking food that emits smells and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The gulf was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom refused to leave the gulf.
All but one British cruiser sank, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the struggle organized by the Mekere movement to achieve independence, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the death of the great chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland spans two harbours, so there are many beaches in the area. The most popular beaches are spread across three areas.
The North Shore beaches (located within the North Harbour area) are located on the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
It is almost all beach here, swimming is safe, and most places have the shade of New Zealand Christmas trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located in Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in the central part of Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes crowded with families on vacation, and there are all kinds of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main beer in the area is "Number One" beer. It has a simple taste but is very refreshing and easy to drink. Another local beer is called "Manta".
You can buy a lot of French wines here, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be more suitable for long-distance transportation.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you are still worried, you can easily buy bottled water.
For Australians, the concept of "Ferrari White" coffee is still relatively unfamiliar. A small cup of black coffee is "espresso", the cream (not foam) in a cappuccino is piled high, and tea is not paired with milk.
Hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The price of fruit juice is expensive, but the quality is good.
Many people visit the Great Barrier Reef throughout the year, and there are few incidents of injury on the Great Barrier Reef as a result of participation in any of the activities mentioned above.
Despite this, you should still follow the advice of the relevant departments, comply with all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish can be found on the beaches and estuaries near 1770 town from October to April each year. They can also be found at other times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
The main habitat of the saltwater crocodile is not the ocean, but the mouth of the rivers in the north of Rockhampton.
Early booking can give travelers peace of mind, knowing that they have a place to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Although travel agencies can help you book camping and other forms of accommodation, they usually work with specific hotels.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport pick-up and drop-off, and some even offer flight and hotel accommodation packages.
If you need time to consider whether the price is suitable or if you need to obtain other documents (such as a visa) to go to your destination, they can reserve the booking for you.
If any changes or requests are needed, they should be made through the travel agent, not directly with the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants choose to camp on site, and most participants consider this to be an essential part of the festival experience.
If you want to watch the performance up close, you have to get there early and set up camp near the stage.
Remember, although the music on the main stage may have ended, other parts of the festival may continue to play music until late at night.
Some music festivals have special camping areas for families with children.
If you cross the North Sea in winter, you should check the location of the passenger cabin, because sailing on ice can cause very terrible noise for those who are most affected.
St. Petersburg cruises include sightseeing activities within the city. Cruise passengers may be exempt from visas (please refer to the terms and conditions for details).
Casinos usually try to make customers spend as much time and money as possible. Casinos usually have no windows or clocks, and the exits are hard to find.
They usually provide special food, drinks, and entertainment activities to keep guests happy and make them stay at the casino.
Some venues provide free alcoholic drinks. However, intoxication weakens a person's judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving or crossing a pass in a high latitude area should consider the possibility of encountering snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy roads, friction is low, and you cannot drive as you would on a clean asphalt road.
In a blizzard, snowfall can be enough to trap you in a very short time.
Snowfall, snow drifts, water droplets or ice on the windshield may also obstruct the view.
On the other hand, snow and ice weather is very common in many countries, and transportation is almost never interrupted throughout the year.
Hunting activities are perhaps the most attractive tourist activities in Africa, and are the highlight of many tourists' itineraries.
The word "safari" is commonly used to refer to a land-based journey to observe the impressive wildlife of Africa, especially in the tropical grasslands.

Ironing damp clothes can help them dry out. Even if there is no iron and ironing board in the room, many hotels offer a borrowing service.
If you don't have an iron, or you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer (if you have one).
Be careful not to let the clothes get too hot (this can cause shrinkage, and in extreme cases, it can cause the clothes to burn).
There are many ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific pollutants.
In some areas, boiling for one minute is enough, while in other areas it takes several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you are concerned about this, you should consider buying sealed bottled water produced by a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter harmful animals that are not common in their hometown.
Pests can damage food, causing irritation, and in more severe cases, allergic reactions, spreading toxins or infectious diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can kill humans through violence, are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping refers to the opportunity to purchase duty-free goods at a specific location.
Travelers to countries/regions that levy heavy taxes on cigarettes can sometimes save a lot of money, and buying products such as alcohol and tobacco is particularly cost-effective in these places.
The most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway are between Point Marion and Fairmont, where the road frequently passes through remote and isolated areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, you'd better keep your wits about you: there are steep hills, narrow roads, and sharp turns everywhere.
The speed limit posted on this stretch of road is significantly lower than that of the previous and subsequent stretches, with common speed limits being 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and the importance of strictly adhering to speed limits is greater than on other stretches.
However, strangely enough, the cell phone service here is much stronger than on many other routes along the way (such as the Pennsylvania prairie).
German pastries are good, but Bavarian pastries are even more diverse and colorful, similar to their southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit pastry is very common, and apples can be used to make pastry all year round, and you can also eat peaches and apricots in the summer.
Many German baked goods also feature almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes and strong coffee are often a great match.
If you want to try some flavorful little sweets, you can try fruit jam rolls, which have different names in different regions, such as Berliner, Pfannkuchen, and Krapfen.
Curry rice is a dish made with spices and herbs, and is usually served with meat or vegetables.
Curry rice can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on how much water is used.
In the northern part of India and the inland areas of Pakistan, curry is often made with sour milk; while in the southern part of India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
Indonesia has 17,000 islands, so Indonesian cuisine is just a collective term that encompasses all kinds of local cuisines across the country.
However, without further adjectives, this word usually refers to food that originates from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now, you can find Javanese cuisine all over the islands, including many dishes with simple seasoning methods. The main seasoning ingredients that Javanese people like are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various spices.
The stirrups hang on both sides of the saddle and are used to support the rider's feet.
They provide better stability for the rider, but also have safety risks because the rider's feet may get stuck.
If the rider is thrown off the horse, but one foot is caught in the stirrup, the horse may drag him along as it runs. To minimize this risk, some preventive measures can be taken.
First, most horseback riders wear shoes with spurs, and the soles are smooth and quite narrow.
Secondly, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety buckles that will release if the rider falls back, allowing the saddle to fall off the horse.
The Cochamó Valley in Chile, which is often called the Yosemite of South America, is a popular destination for climbers.
From the peaks, you can see the stunning and awe-inspiring scenery. Climbers from all over the world are constantly exploring new routes on the steep cliffs that serve as climbing walls.
High-mountain skiing includes downhill skiing and snowboarding, which is a very popular sport. In this sport, skis or snowboards are fixed to your feet and you slide down the snow-covered terrain.
Skiing is the main tourist activity for many ski enthusiasts, who are sometimes called "ski maniacs" because they plan to ski at a particular location for the entire holiday.
The idea of skiing has been around for a long time - cave paintings of skiers date back to 5000 BC!
As a sport, downhill skiing can be traced back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first leisure ski club in Australia.
Skiing self-guided tour: This activity is also called cross-country skiing, skiing tourism or skiing trekking.
This activity is related to Alpine skiing or mountaineering, but it is not usually done with these activities. These activities are done on steep terrain and require harder skis and boots.
Imagine the skiing route as a similar hiking route.
When conditions are good, you can go further than walking - but only in a few cases can you achieve the same speed as cross-country skiing on a flat track without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a continent with a relatively small area but many independent countries. In general, traveling across multiple countries means having to go through visa applications and passport checks multiple times.
However, in this regard, the Schengen area is a bit like a country.
As long as you are staying in this area, you can usually cross the border directly without having to go through a passport checkpoint again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately to each Schengen member country, saving you time, money, and hassle.
There is no uniform definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax agencies define an antique as an item that is more than 100 years old.
This definition has regional differences, and the year limit may be shorter in North America than in Europe.
Crafts may be defined as antiques, although they are much younger than mass-produced counterparts.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sami people. The culture surrounding this industry is also important for many people who make their living from other professions.
However, even if we start from the traditional sense, not all the Sami people are involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, they make a living from fishing, hunting and similar activities, and usually use reindeer as draft animals.
Nowadays, many Sami people are involved in modern industries. Tourism is a major source of income for the Sami, or the Sami region.

If the country you want to visit is subject to a travel warning, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the recommendations of governments other than your own, but their recommendations are made for their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different circumstances than Europeans or Arabs.
Travel alerts can only provide a brief summary of the local situation.
Compared to the more detailed information provided in other places, the recommendations provided here are often rough, general, and too simple.
Adverse weather is a general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon; such weather can cause destruction, serious social disorder or loss of life.

Anyone planning to visit a country that may be considered a war zone should receive specialized training.
Search for "counter-terrorism courses" on the Internet, and you may find the address of a local company that provides training.

Course training usually lasts 2-5 days and will involve role-playing, first aid training, and sometimes even weapons training.
Books and magazines about survival in the wild are common, but there are few publications about survival in combat zones.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must carry valid documents when returning.
As for whether or not they want to issue passports without gender (X) or whether or not they want to change documents to match the desired name and gender, the willingness of each government is different.
The degree of recognition of these documents by foreign governments also varies greatly.
In the post-September 11, 2001 era, security checkpoints have become more intrusive.
Transgender people who have not yet undergone surgery have to reveal their privacy when passing through the scanner, and cannot guarantee their dignity.
Offshore flow is the rapid return of waves from the beach to the sea, usually occurring on a reef or similar feature.
The underwater topography causes the backflow to concentrate in several deeper areas, where strong currents may form.
Most deaths are caused by swimming against the current, which is physically exhausting and unlikely to be successful.
After getting through the turbulent water flow, it was not so difficult to swim back.
Try to swim to a place where you won't get trapped again, or wait for rescue (depending on your skills and whether you have been found).
The impact of returning home is faster than the impact of culture (the honeymoon period is shorter), lasts longer, and may be more severe.
For travelers who easily adapt to new cultures, it is sometimes difficult to re-adapt to their native culture.
After living abroad for a while, you will find that you have adapted to the new culture and have dropped some of the habits of your hometown culture.
When you first come to a new country, people may be very patient and understanding with you, because they know that travelers need to adjust to a new country.
People may not realize that travelers also need patience and understanding on the way back.
For children, the sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting activities in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and before the show starts, you can see them silently standing there.
You can always hear the voices of tourists and street vendors here. The sound and light intertwine, like telling a touching story.
The lion-headed man is depicted on the backdrop, and it is also the narrator of the long story.
The scene is displayed on the pyramid, with different pyramids being lit up.
The South Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819. Several countries claim sovereignty over the islands, and the islands have the most bases, with 16 bases in use on the islands in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the Antarctic Peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, where the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
Others include Livinston Island and Deception Island. There, a still active volcanic crater is submerged by floodwaters, providing a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is located in the south of the peninsula, facing the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains on the peninsula join the highlands here, then reform as the Ellsworth Mountains, a 360-kilometer-long range that is bisected by the Minnesota glacier.
In the north, or rather, the Sentinel Range, the highest mountain range in Antarctica, the Mont Blanc Range, is located, with the highest peak being Mount Vinson at 4892 meters.
In remote areas where cell phone signals are not available, satellite phones may be your only option.
In general, satellite phones cannot replace mobile phones, because you can only make calls outdoors where the satellite signal is strong.
This service is often used in shipping, including yachts and expeditions that require remote data and voice communication.
Your local phone service provider should be able to provide you with detailed information about connecting to this service.
For those who plan to spend the slack year, studying abroad is becoming an increasingly popular choice.
This is particularly popular among high school graduates, who can take a year off before going to college without affecting their education.
In many cases, taking a gap year abroad can substantially improve your chances of getting into a good university when you return home.
In general, participation in these educational programs requires payment of tuition fees.
Finland is an excellent sailing destination, known as the "thousand lakes country", and it has thousands of islands within its lakes and coastal islands.
In the archipelago and lakes, yachts are not necessary.
The size of the coastal islands and the largest lakes is large enough to accommodate any yacht, but even smaller boats and kayaks can provide a different experience.
Boating is a nationwide leisure activity in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand also have similar situations, but are unique in other ways (for example, in the Netherlands, this figure is one to forty).
Most typical Baltic cruises will spend a longer time in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can have several days to fully explore this historic city, and then sleep on the ship at night.
If you are only disembarking for sightseeing, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise ships advertise Berlin, Germany as a highlight. As seen in the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and the cost of the cruise does not include the cost of visiting the city.
For people of all ages and backgrounds, flying can be a terrifying experience, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
This is not a matter of being left behind: it is no different from the fear and disgust that many people have for other things.
For some people, understanding the principles of how an airplane works and the procedures for flying can be helpful in overcoming fears caused by unknowns or uncontrollable situations.
Courier companies can earn high wages due to the speedy delivery of goods. Time is very important for business documents, goods, or parts used for urgent repairs.
On some routes, large companies have their own planes, but for other routes and small companies, there is a problem.
If they use air transport to transport goods, it may take several days to unload and clear customs on some routes.
The fastest way is to carry it as checked baggage. According to the airline's regulations, it is prohibited to carry luggage of passengers who have not boarded the plane, and you will need to be there at this time.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a lot of money to enjoy this privilege (or, better yet, let your company pay for it).
However, it is not cheap: according to a rough estimate, the price of a business class ticket may be four times that of an economy class ticket, and the price of a first class ticket may be as high as 11 times that of an economy class ticket!
In general, there is no need to look for discounted business or first class tickets when flying directly from A to B.
Airlines are very clear that some core customers are willing to pay a high price to get the privilege of fast and comfortable travel, so airlines will charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic, and it has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic of Moldova in the eastern part of the country. The republic has its own government and currency, but it has not been recognized by any member state of the United Nations.
Although the political negotiations failed, the economic ties between the two regions of Moldova were rebuilt.

There are still many men and women who survived here and are still alive today; and the relatives of more people were slaughtered there, and some worked hard until they died, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please give this place the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not make marks or graffiti on the buildings, so as not to damage the ruins.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the locals prefer to speak Catalan, and the vast majority of people understand Catalan, while Spanish is understood by almost everyone.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, as it is the first official language stipulated by law.

The regular announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but the automatic system will make temporary announcements in multiple languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are notorious for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is usually just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to live in Paris is to be as polite and well-mannered as possible, like someone with “bien élevé” (good manners). This will make it much easier to participate in social activities.
If you show a little basic courtesy, the rudeness of the Parisians will quickly disappear.

Similarly, men must wear long pants that cover their knees.
You can also borrow them from the wardrobe at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each use, so these dresses may feel a bit uncomfortable to wear. They are all the same size!
The cuisine of Mallorca is similar to that of the Mediterranean region, based mainly on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and using olive oil exclusively.

All nouns except for those that indicate your "Sie" should be capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important method for distinguishing certain verbs and objects.
This can also make reading easier, although it does make writing more complex to some extent, because you need to judge whether a verb or adjective is being used in a nominalized form.
Italian is relatively easy to pronounce because the pronunciation and spelling of most words are the same

However, someone who knows a little Spanish may be quick to draw this conclusion: Portuguese is very similar to Spanish, so there is no need to learn it separately.
Nowadays, most of the former modern observatories have been replaced and only preserved as museums or educational venues.
Because light pollution was not as severe as it is now during its peak, observatories are usually built in urban areas or on campuses, making them more accessible than modern observatories.
Most modern research telescopes are large facilities located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami, also known as cherry blossom viewing, has been a Japanese custom since the 8th century.
This concept comes from China, and peonies are a type of flower that the Chinese people love.
In Japan, the earliest cherry blossom party was held by the emperor for himself and other members of the royal family at the imperial palace.

Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, established to celebrate the birth of Christ.
Many traditions associated with this holiday are also accepted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
One tradition is to wake up and watch the sunrise outside on Easter night.
Of course, this tradition has its explanation in Christian theology, but it is likely that it was a celebration of spring and a prayer for a bountiful harvest that existed before the birth of Christ.
More traditional churches often hold Easter Vigils on Saturday nights during the Easter weekend, with the congregation usually flooding into the church at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
Initially, the animals arrived on these islands by swimming, flying, or floating.
Because they are far from the mainland, mammals cannot travel long distances to get here, which makes giant turtles the main herbivores of the Coral Islands.
After humans arrived on the Galapagos Islands, they introduced many mammals, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you go on a winter tour to the Arctic or Antarctic regions, you can experience the polar night, which is a period of time when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides an excellent opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark for most of the day.
These areas have a sparse population and generally do not have light pollution problems, so you can enjoy a dazzling starry sky.
