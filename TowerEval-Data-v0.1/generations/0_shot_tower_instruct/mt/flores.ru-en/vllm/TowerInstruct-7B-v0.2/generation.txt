This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely accepted theory, but also provides details that can't usually be gleaned from fossil remains, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were above a chestnut-brown color, and below - either pale or had carotenoid pigmentation.
The find also allows us to learn about the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft called a rachis, but still have other features, such as frills and crests, researchers concluded that the rachis likely evolved later from other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation and display. The researchers suggested that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample represents adult plumage, not chick down.
The researchers suggested that, despite the fact that it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen has the plumage of an adult, not a chick's down.

They found that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: it was established that the activity of all stars in the system is determined by their brightness, rotation and nothing else.
The combination of luminosity and spin is used to determine the number of Rossby waves in the star associated with the plasma flow.
The fewer Rossby numbers, the less active the star is in relation to magnetic field inversions.

The work done was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the galaxy in Sagittarius.
The effect the team was looking for could be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon pulls the Earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way affects the galaxy in Sagittarius.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way as it does with regular matter.
According to this theory, a significant portion of the dark matter around the Galaxy is located in the form of a halo and consists of a large number of small particles.

In research in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal, Dr Tony Moll has found exceptionally drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB).
In an interview, he said the new strain "raises very big concerns because it leads to a very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have caught the virus in hospital, Dr Moll thinks, and at least two were healthcare workers at the hospital.
In one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 people through close contact.
However, the percentage of people with multi-drug resistant TB in the total TB population still seems low; 6000 out of a total of 330 000 infected at this particular moment in South Africa.

The government also promised several million doses of vaccine against encephalitis, which will help to prepare healthcare facilities for next year.
Plans to deliver vaccines to the historically hardest-hit areas this year have been delayed due to a lack of funding and low priority compared to other diseases.

During the day they are colder than the surrounding surface, and at night they are warmer.
Their thermal characteristics aren't as stable as those of larger caves on Earth, which often maintain nearly constant temperatures, but they're consistent with those of deep pits in the ground, said Glen Cushing, a planetary geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey and the University of Northern Arizona in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally carried out using low-tech methods: the voter closes themselves in a booth and puts a pre-printed slip of paper, indicating their chosen candidate, into an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the person drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
French election laws are quite strict in terms of procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that there are no envelopes inside at the start of the vote and that no other envelopes have been added, except those of those who have been authorised to vote and whose votes have been counted properly.
Candidates can send their representatives to monitor the entire process, and in the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision according to a special procedure.

Four skiers in the women's sitting group failed to finish their runs, and 45 of 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to finish the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police have returned the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector-General D.K. Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and returned her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are named as Baba Kandhjar, Bhuta Kandhjar, Rampo Kandhjar and Vishnu Kandhjar.
Police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused were produced before judges with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the building at the moment the car crashed into it, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Subsequently, the Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged Adekoye with the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting charges and trial, but any testimony could be tainted because her celebrity has been widely exploited by the media.
This is standard practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish law works differently and the courts found the publication of the photographs to be potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to be really walking on the edge, publishing photos and other data about suspects."
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is responsible for prosecuting the case, told reporters that no further comment would be made, at least until a verdict is delivered.
The document, according to the leaked information, will concern the dispute over the borders that Palestine wants to establish on the basis of those that existed before the start of the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other topics reportedly discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both peoples, and the issue of the Jordan River valley.
Israel is demanding a permanent military presence in the valley for a decade after the signing of the agreement, while the PNA is agreeing to the preservation of such a presence for only five years.
The deer involved in the additional deer-proofing test had to be closely monitored by rangers as the test was being observed and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of the NPWS and NSW Sporting Shooters Association partnership, during the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program, qualified volunteers were recruited.
The four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have undergone comprehensive training and safety briefings, said Mike O'Flahavan, acting director of the Wildlife and National Park Service's Law Enforcement and Investigations Division.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), consisting of nine members.
This is the fifth CEP Marty has received in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the previous interim electoral council resign as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the massive protests against the government that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were caused by the failure to hold elections, some of which were supposed to have taken place as early as 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of defective iPod devices have been reported, resulting in six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 cases involving the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Labor and Industry announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called "not serious."
In response, the ministry called Apple's delay in reporting the issue "very regrettable."
At 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday) an earthquake occurred in Mariana.
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman hijacked a tourist bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and took Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were freed earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
Later, photographers took the place of the elderly woman, as she went to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Lygins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and gynaecologist and started working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating cases of premature birth in his free time.
His research showed that if the hormone is introduced, it will enhance the development of the child's lungs during the period of fetal development.
Xinhua reports that on Wednesday, state investigators discovered two flight recorders, or "black boxes".
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to the Moon.
Here's what Tommy Dreamer said: "Moon was the first Queen of Extreme. She was my first manager. Moon passed away on a night of two moons. It's already a unique event, like she was. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said: "The moon was as infected as I am... Maybe even more infected... I love her and I'm going to miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
Of 1,400 people surveyed ahead of the 2010 federal election, the number who opposed Australia becoming a republic has grown by 8 per cent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard during the 2010 federal election campaign said Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34% of those surveyed share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
The survey found that 29 per cent of respondents believed Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent believed the country did not need the form of government.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games but his fitness is now in doubt after he complained of illness.
He was unable to take painkillers as they are banned in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at Central Missouri University, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
On Tuesday, it was announced that by early February, several people had confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software.
Comets may have been the source of water delivery to Earth, as well as the source of organic compounds that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, as comets have been colliding with Earth for a very long time.
The 53-year-old Cuomo took office as governor earlier this year and signed the same-sex marriage bill into law last month.
He called the rumours "political nonsense and stupidity".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration says will allow planes to fly more direct routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology instead of the old ground-based radar technology, which will allow air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the position of aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport has been sent to Wembley, there will be no stopping of land trains, and there are no parking lots or lay-bys on the surface.
Concerns over a lack of transport have led to speculation that the game may have to be played behind closed doors without fans.
The study, published Thursday in the journal Science, describes the emergence of a new species of bird on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden) reported that due to mating between the endemic Darwin's finch (Geospiza fortes) and the transplanted cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris), a new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process would take much longer.
Gold can be given any shape. It can be cast into very small forms.
It can be drawn into thin wire, which can be twisted and plated. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It could be made very thin and attached to another metal. It could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the illuminated illustrations in books - the so-called 'facing page'.
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make a pH indicator using red cabbage juice.
The juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH value is determined by the degree of saturation with hydrogen ions (H in pH) of the chemical compound under investigation.
Hydrogen ions are protons with electrons removed (hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Get a new mixture by mixing the two dry powders in one container, and then mold a ball with your clean, damp hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the top layer, which will be unusual, then a kind of shell will form.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet connected to a complex sewage system.
Remnants of the sewage systems have been found in the homes of Minoan cities on the islands of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women bathed together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down almost instantly.
The satellite was delivered into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere somewhat distorts our light and view.
A giant rocket more than 100 feet tall is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed our world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel has done for us is to give us much easier and faster transportation.
It gave us the train, the car and many other vehicles.
Below them are larger cats that eat prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
And finally, many small cats (including domestic house cats) eat and hunt much smaller animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, the special work that each type of cat does, which keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
The pride consists of one to three adult males that are related, as well as females and cubs, the number of which can reach thirty.
Females are usually related to each other and make up a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave very similarly to packs of wolves or dogs - animals that, in their behavior, are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) and are also very dangerous to their prey.
As a fully developed athlete, a tiger can climb trees (albeit not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with the strength of five strong men.
Tigers belong to the same family (Felidae) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that have the ability to roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like the barking of sentences made up of indistinct words.
Cheetahs love to eat small animals. If the opportunity arises, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that the cheetah hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow the trail of animals and find prey by smell, tracking its movements on the ground with their sense of smell.
They are able to see perfectly in the dark with the help of night vision and move almost imperceptibly. Ocelots track their prey by blending in with their surroundings, and then pounce on their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population it came from (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or changes from what it had before to become a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed at all - it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to a new environment, it begins to look less and less like the rest of the population.
Over time, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that it will be impossible to say they are the same species.
We call this process speciation, the origin of new species, and it is a necessary consequence and a crucial part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants feed on the sun with the help of photosynthesis. In addition, they cast a shadow.
We build our homes and make our clothes from plants, and most of our food comes from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the most fearsome predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were lined with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, and it had an extra row of teeth on its palate, so that anyone who crossed its path was doomed.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that his tongue was forked. He fed on turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and may have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that went into the water; even a giant dinosaur like a tyrannosaur would not have been a match for it.
Although much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans did have some strange and unusual dishes served at feasts, such as wild boar, peacock, snails and a type of rodent called a hedgehog.
There was another difference: while poor people and women ate while sitting on chairs, the rich liked to have communal feasts, during which they ate while lying on their sides.
The diet of ancient Romans could not have included foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in the following centuries.
In particular, they had no maize, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of the gods, which was considered the god's home.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to please the gods' desires in ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which only priests could enter.
Sometimes special towers in the form of pyramids called "zikkurats" were built as elements of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not particularly important.
Most of the Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; the shops had open counters that opened onto the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Icelandic sagas tell how Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and, pushing on further west, he discovered Greenland and gave it its name.
But regardless of his discovery, at that time the Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each of the countries was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the peoples, rulers, traditions, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you saw the movie National Treasure, you might think the Declaration of Independence had a treasure map on the back.
However, this is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence reads: "The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a Declaration of the causes which impel them to the separation.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that, in its early days, this large parchment document (29¾ by 24½ inches) was folded for easier storage.
So it's quite possible the recording was added simply as a placeholder.
As a result of Operation Neptune and subsequent battles, the north of France was liberated, but the south was not yet liberated.
It was run by "Vichy" French, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of opposing them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France. The invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just 2 weeks, the Free French forces and Americans liberated southern France and headed towards Germany.
Civilization is a separate culture, the bearers of which are a fairly large group of people who live and work together, society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin civilis, which means "civil" and is a relative of the Latin words civis, meaning "citizen", and civitas, meaning "city" or "city-state", and it also expresses the size of society in a certain way.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. Civilizational culture implies the transfer of knowledge across several generations, an uninterrupted cultural presence, and a continuous spread.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving corresponding historical evidence, and therefore cannot be recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen states, under the Articles of Confederation, formed a weak central government, with a single body, the Congress.
Congress had no taxing powers, and since there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the states, which often refused to cooperate and refused to enforce its acts.
He also lacked the authority to repeal state tax laws and tariffs.
To pass amendments, according to the articles, requires unanimous approval from all states, but states have been so irresponsible with the central government that their representatives have often been absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions. Residents of these regions of Italy participate in international competitions and the Olympics.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to its belonging to the cluster/group of islands, Japan is often called an archipelago from a geographical point of view.
Taiwan has its origins many years ago, in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating the transformation of indigenous grain production methods and hiring Chinese workers to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which it ceded the rights to Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a more accurate idea of what they looked like originally.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored. Restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the world's most common format for static photos is 35mm, and that's the size that dominated film in the analogue era's twilight.
It's still made today, but more importantly, it's the aspect ratio that digital camera image sizes have inherited.
The 35mm format is actually somewhat confusing, it's 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get a ratio with small integers) is therefore taken as 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format family) are equal to or close to these proportions.
The oft-used and often derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while still maintaining a certain amount of order in the composition.
It says that the main object should be placed at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity united European states despite differences in languages and traditions.
Its pervasive power touched everyone, from the king to the commoner.
One of the central Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds exist precisely for this purpose.
The center of church power was based in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether this dogma was being observed.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
That strategy proved effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, though the blockade violated universally accepted international laws laid out in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sectors of the oceans, putting even neutral ships at risk.
As the response to this tactic was muted, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, among the majority of citizens and peoples, sentiments such as pacifism and isolationism prevailed.
Having experienced the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, states wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America and accepted an offer to work for the Edison company in the city of New York.
He arrived in the US with four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, who had been his boss at his previous job, to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, a unique way of indicating periods of time was used; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a special dynasty.
Furthermore, during the reign of each dynasty, there was fragmentation and instability. The most famous period was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years during the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, there were fierce military actions between many noble people fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms era was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in battles over who would sit on the throne in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many such social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not a single ruler.
After the Revolution, work opportunities opened up for all men, which allowed the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same goes for the army, because ranks are based on qualities, not on origin.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in topics unrelated to worldly life. He often visited a cave, which became known as "Hira" on the mountain "Nur" (light) for reflection.
Well, the cave, which has survived to this day, gives us a very vivid idea of Muhammad's spiritual aspirations.
The cave is located on top of a mountain to the north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It is very difficult to find, even for someone who knows it exists. In the cave, a person is in complete isolation.
There is nothing to see but the pure, beautiful sky above your head and the many surrounding mountains. From the depths of the cave, you can only see and hear a very small part of this world.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C. and is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor the pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the Giza Necropolis, in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and relatives.
The upward hook sign looks like a V, and the downward hook sign looks like a bracket or a square with no bottom.
"Up" means you start at the tip and pull the bow forward, and "down" means you start where your hand holds the bow and pull it back.
The upward movement of the bow usually produces a softer sound, while the downward movement of the bow produces a stronger and more forceful sound.
You can draw your own stroke, but remember that the stroke is printed for musical reasons and it is usually worth following it.
On October 6, 1789, an angry mob of women from the market forced King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles in terror.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted threats at the king and queen.
A crowd of people forced the King and Queen to open the windows wide.
At one point, a member of the crowd gestured to the head of the royal guardsman killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The military expenses of American imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the expenses and interest on bond loans moved on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking offices.
Of course, the superprofits brought in by the long exploitation of the Filipinos constituted the main income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era in which these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history that spans the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 CE).
The High Middle Ages succeeded the earlier Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, which according to the accepted view ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of practical ideas, from technological progress or technological imperative to the strict view that the fundamental logic that drives human destinies is related to the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
Most views of technological determinism share two broad ideas: that the direction of technological development is largely impervious to cultural or political influence, and that, in turn, the "effects" of technology on society are determined by the technology itself, rather than by society.
For example, one could say that the automobile is a necessary cause of the development of roads.
However, the nationwide road network is economically unviable for only a small group of vehicles, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increase in the number of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new healthcare treatments for the injuries sustained.
Romanticism in many ways included cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time, customs and culture arose that were in harmony with the place of residence of that society, which were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is called the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Word of it as a center of luxury began around 400 CE and lasted until around 1100 CE.
Its status declined throughout the twelfth century mainly because the Crusaders returned with such luxury goods as silk and spices that were more highly valued than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
It was at this point that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, the clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow communication channels, styles in the West can be 25-30 years behind.
Own styles began to develop in Western Europe by the end of the Middle Ages. One of the greatest achievements of that time, thanks to the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture practiced to produce enough food to meet the needs of only the farmer and his/her family.
Natural farming is a simple, often organic, system of agriculture that uses the seeds of plants that grow in a given ecosystem, along with crop rotation and other relatively simple methods of increasing yields.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel constrained by society's standards and allow such people to define themselves.
Differences may exist between subcultures based on age, nationality, social status, place of residence and/or gender of the people that make up the subculture.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often declare their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to illustrate several unfortunate cases where children, due to lack of attention, unfortunate circumstances or intentional abuse, did not have contact with adults during their upbringing.
Such children are called "feral" or "wild". Some feral children were isolated by humans (usually their own parents). In some cases, such rejection of their child was the result of the parents' rejection of their child's serious intellectual or physical disability.
Children living on the streets may have experienced severe forms of violence or trauma before running away or being abandoned.
Others were allegedly raised by animals; some of them lived in the wild on their own.
If he is fully domesticated by animals instead of humans, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) that are almost identical to the specific animal that raised him - for example, his fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should be simpler and more engaging, scaffolding beats out many technologies.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather a form of assistance to those going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is Clippy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding, which helps with learning, is built into the software and is designed to remind, explain and ask questions about procedures that the learner might find too difficult to handle alone.
Children are handed over to care for a multitude of reasons, from abandonment to abuse and even extortion.
Children should not be allowed to grow up in an environment where they are not provided with upbringing, care and education, but they do grow up.
We believe the foster care system is safe for children.
Our foster care system should provide safe housing, loving foster parents, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care should provide all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique features of the Internet lead to additional scope in terms of approach to use and satisfaction.
Thus, the idea that "learning" and "socialization" are important motivating factors for Internet use (James et al., 1995)
"Personal involvement" and "long-term contact" were also named by Eimme and McCardle (1998) as new dimensions of motivation when they studied how people respond to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the field of interpreting microexpressions - facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to determine whether a person is lying by means of the correct interpretation of their micro-expressions.
In the article "The President's Speech," Oliver Sachs described how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage can nevertheless correctly assess the sincerity of the speaker.
According to his assumption, animals, for example, domestic dogs, may possess similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
Studies conducted in the twentieth century showed that there are two types of genetic variability: hidden and expressed.
A mutation introduces a new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the set of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination with each generation shuffle the variations between the two pools.
In the savannah, primates with a digestive system like humans have a hard time meeting their amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
Failure to do so will result in serious consequences such as stunted growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but they are poorly digested by primates like ourselves if not cooked.
On the contrary, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also a rich source of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
Given all of the above, it is not surprising that our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in much the same way as chimpanzees in the savannah do to this day.
Sleep interruption is a process of deliberate waking during normal sleep and falling asleep again after a short time (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily done with a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you out of sleep without fully waking up.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm in your sleep, then it can be placed on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options that are based on biological rhythms include drinking large amounts of liquid (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, which causes the person to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and soul.
The lower the voltage, the more positive the life force within you is. Every human being is potentially given the ability to find absolute peace and a sense of fulfillment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment, the only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negative attitude.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been supplemented with the Mahayana path of love and a variety of techniques from Indian yoga.
The principle of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple: it consists of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-consuming love.
The energy of kundalini (the energy of enlightenment) in kundalini yoga is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The heart of Tibetan meditation is Yoga of Deities. Through visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleaned, chakras are activated, and the enlightenment of consciousness is achieved.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the US. After the war ended, disagreements regarding the system, process, and culture led to discord between the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last the next 40 years, with real wars fought through proxies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other places around the world.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already been breached, and the only hope was retreat and reorganisation along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became irrelevant almost overnight when some 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after seizing eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is certainly the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The job of sailors has traditionally been to ensure a country's ability to move its people and goods, while also preventing an enemy from moving its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic convoy during World War II, where the Americans tried to ferry people and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mostly its submarines, tried to stop this movement.
If the anti-Hitler coalition had failed, Germany would most likely have been able to conquer Britain, just as it had conquered the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them for milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often watched over by goat-herders who were usually children or teenagers, much like the more common practice of a shepherd. These grazing methods are still in use today.
Cart roads were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the packhorse roads were little more than parallel rows of wooden planks, they allowed horses to carry larger loads at greater speed than the slightly more rutted roads of the time.
Sleepers were first used a long time ago to keep the rails in place, but it was later realised that the tracks were more effective with a layer of iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Over time, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron appeared.
The first known form of transportation was walking, humans started walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (which means upright man).
For their Australopithecus ancestors, bipedalism was not so common.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally conscious lives, we can become members of environmental groups and even activists to help alleviate the suffering that is to come.
Typically, it's like treating the symptoms. If we're not looking for a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and address it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot under the influence of the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and due to overpopulation and people's extravagant lifestyles, the problems have become more widespread.
After passage by Congress on July 4, a manuscript copy of the document, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to printer John Dunlap's shop.
150-200 copies were made overnight, now known as the "Dunlap Broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nicholson in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8.
On July 6, one copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 known Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of the document; the original manuscript copy has not survived.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and made it to the present day. We call them birds.
They are often not considered dinosaurs because they have feathers and are capable of flight.
But there is still much to be said about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have claws and scales on their paws, they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on processing information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1. These numbers are called "binary digits" or "bits" in computer jargon.
It can be difficult to immediately identify oral poisoning, as symptoms such as vomiting are too general to make a quick diagnosis.
The best sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicine or toxic household chemical.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for poisoning by that particular poison.
The term "beetle" is used by entomologists formally to refer to a group of insects.
This concept comes from the well-known bed bugs, insects that have been around since ancient times and are well adapted to parasitizing on humans.
Both predators and bed bugs are nesting species adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the US, there are an estimated 400,000 cases of MS, making it the leading neurological disease of young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that twice as many women as men suffer from multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their child.
When adoption or fostering takes place, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main goal of science is to figure out how the world works by applying the scientific method, which is actually the basis of most scientific research.
It is not, however, the only one. Scientific research is also guided by experimentation (an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses), asking questions, and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the ancient texts, and especially the Bible in Latin.
In all scientific matters, including psychology, the views of Aristotle were adopted.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often heavily dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their generation by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that are not simply a response to external periodic stimuli have been recorded in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue autonomous cycling over a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the first suggestions that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase implanted their DNA into a bacterium using phages, i.e., viruses.
They conducted two experiments, labeling the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus and the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can cause a wide variety of outcomes, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected stretch of genetic material, and whether the mutated cells are embryonic stem cells.
Only mutations in the germ line cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is interesting for those who like to go to nature to enjoy the landscape, including wild animals and plants.
Examples of active recreation at the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits and learning about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small towns in the countryside to go to their workplaces, while those whose workplaces are in the place they have just left drive past them.
In this active traffic movement, everyone is connected to and supports the personal car-based transportation system in one way or another.
Now science indicates that the vast hydrocarbon economy has affected one of the stable states of the biosphere that has sustained human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone is a member of society and uses transport systems, and virtually everyone complains about these systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about the quality of water or collapsing bridges.
Why are there so many complaints about transport systems, why do they break down every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent, or are there more fundamental reasons for this?
The study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other is carried out as part of the study of transport flows.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the intensity of traffic because it is impossible to predict the behavior of drivers with 100% probability.
Fortunately, driver behavior is often quite systematic; thus, traffic flows as a whole have some systematicity and can be approximately described mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships were established between three main variables: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of rail facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily, find food and mates.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their body, which gives them an advantage.
This provides them with more hiding places from predators.
Dragonflies and damselflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Many believed him to be right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems like a reasonable idea, because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world, carrying more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with a width of up to six miles at times.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long, and it is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the pyramids at Giza could never be surpassed.
In the new kingdom of the ancient Egyptians, they admired the monuments created by their predecessors more than a thousand years ago.
The Vatican has a population of about 800 people, making it the smallest independent country in the world, as well as the country with the smallest population.
Italian is used in legislation and official communications in the Vatican.
Italian is also the everyday language for most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Catholics.
People have known the basic chemical elements since ancient times, such as gold, silver and copper, because they can all be found in nature in their pure form and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything was made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
They were like the four states of matter (in that order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also suggested they transitioned into a new state to make what we see.
Essentially, alloys are mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
It is also possible to make alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them could fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil became a good friend for many people when it appeared.
It's sad that when new ways of writing appeared, the pencil lost its former status and people started using it less.
Now people type messages on computer screens and never have to deal with a typewriter.
It is impossible to say what will happen to the keyboard with the advent of newer technologies.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that in order for a lot of protons and neutrons to be in one nucleus, energy is required.
It's like rolling a heavy cart up a hill, and then the re-splitting of the nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means they tend to decay with or without little provocation.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km under the oceans and 100 km under the continents.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
The visible side may have more lunar seas because the crust is thinner there, making it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what makes people act or what might interest them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that accumulate inside them as they grow up.
These theories address what drives particular people to want to do what they do, and what their environment causes them to do or not do.
Two popular theories about content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory of Motivation.
Typically, there are two types of behavior when managers start to manage people who were previously their peers: one extreme is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or "one of the girls").
Such managers find it difficult to make unpopular decisions, take disciplinary action, evaluate job performance, allocate responsibilities, and hold employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that they must change everything the team has done and take credit for it.
After all, the manager is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This kind of behavior often leads to conflicts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are some differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They are usually more autonomous than employees in traditional teams, because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which local management may not always understand.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the team of managers, to whom each participant reports. The invisible team sets standards for each participant.
Why would an organization go through the laborious process of creating a self-organizing organization? One of the goals of applying the concepts of self-organizing organizations in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used in all functional units of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the organization's concerted efforts to overcome the obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that will meet the client's interests.
Before an organization can become innovative, executives must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum Approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of effectiveness.
The data of neurobiology provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to the study of consciousness, thus narrowing the field of research and making it much more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is used by scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, insults and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen structures and processes in the brain.
This provides us with a wealth of data and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes that occur in our consciousness.
Despite the fact that AI is firmly associated with science fiction, it forms a very important area of computer science, which examines the behavior and training of machines and the "imparting" of intelligence to them.
AI research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Here are some examples: control, scheduling and creation of schedules, reaction to diagnoses and client questions, as well as face, handwriting and voice recognition.
Similar questions have been singled out into separate disciplines, the goal of which is to solve the problems we face in everyday life.
Currently, AI systems are often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, being embedded in some software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are very important for any class. Very often, teachers want to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The technology offers a solution with virtual tours, allowing pupils to explore museum exhibits, visit an aquarium or enjoy fine art, all while sitting with their class.
Putting a tour online for all to see is also a great way to refresh your memory of the tour and share your newfound knowledge with future classes.
For example, each year Bennett High School students in North Carolina create a website about their visit to the state capital, and each year the website is updated, but access to old versions is still preserved - they serve as a memory album.
Blogs can also improve students' writing skills. Although students often start their blog using shoddy grammar and spelling, this usually changes due to the presence of an audience.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to strive for improvement in their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Also, by blogging, "students begin to better understand the world around them." Students are inspired to be smart and interesting by engaging readers (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a collaborative tool that motivates students to extend the learning process far beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can enable students to become more analytical and critical, by actively engaging with online materials, students can position themselves in relation to others' work, and articulate their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a delightful bilingual capital of Canada with a huge number of art galleries and museums that reveal the past and present of Canada.
Further south is Niagara Falls, while the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and the surrounding areas.
All of this and more makes Ontario something truly Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabited.
A surprising population comparison: there are more African Americans in the US than citizens in Canada.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is much larger than the others and is a unique continent in terms of wildlife.
Almost all of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region, and it took root particularly on the Comoros and Mayotte.
The spread of European influence and colonisation began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened up a route through the Cape of Good Hope from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahara, and in the south and west, by the Atlantic Ocean.
For women: all tourists are advised to say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (just not too expensive looking).
Women should be aware that because of cultural differences, they may feel like they are being harassed, followed, touched, etc.
Firmly refuse men and don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself (this is unacceptable regardless of cultural differences!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE. It was used by the Romans, Phoenicians and the Merinids as a strategic port, called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Caza-Branca, but abandoned it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city, which was called Ed-Dar-el-Beyda, and the Spanish merchants who established trading bases here called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a whole range of trinkets, but all of it is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, on the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the central part of the city.
Although Goma is a relatively safe place, it is advisable to obtain information in advance about any trips outside of Goma to understand the state of the fighting in the North Kivu province.
This city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, and you can also see mountain gorillas in the wild here for one of the cheapest prices in Africa.
You can get to Goma by bodaboda (mototaxi). The usual (local) price is 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu became a metaphor for an exotic far-off land.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation attracts tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger due to the danger from desert sands.
During the filming of Henry Louis Gates's PBS series "African American Lives," one of the most important stops was made here.
This city is very different from other cities in the country, as it is dominated by Arabic culture, rather than African culture.
Kruger National Park is located in northeastern South Africa, along the border with Mozambique to the east, and Zimbabwe to the north, with the Crocodile River serving as its southern boundary.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km²; it is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which is home to different wild animals.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the leading one among South African national parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there is a daily conservation fee to visit the park.
It may also be worth buying a Wild Card, which allows you to visit South African national parks either selectively or all at once.
The territory of Hong Kong was named after Hong Kong Island, a place that many tourists consider the main object of their attention.
The string of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline is compared to a glittering bar chart, framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the most picturesque places of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and head to the coast of the Jilin Peninsula, which is located opposite.
The bulk of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on reclaimed land on the north shore.
This is the place that the British colonisers took for themselves, and if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, then this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest belt of coastal mangrove forests, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the shore inland in Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
These forests are not just mangrove swamps - they also include some of the last remaining great jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square km, of which about one-third is covered by water or marshes.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer living on its territory.
Buses depart from the intercity bus terminal (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakarta/Bandung, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
As intercity buses are often crowded, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and reliable.
The minibus is a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places like Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
These two towers reach 83 meters in height, and the bridge itself is 378 meters in length and has two traffic lanes 3.5 meters wide.
The height of the substructure is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting the area that is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to various groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycuru and the Payaguá, who survived through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, which was previously called the "huge province of the East Indies," emerged as a result of the clash between Spanish conquerors and local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has largely managed to preserve much of its distinct character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams, as well as the best players in the world in sports such as polo.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Canitas.
Less major tournaments and matches can also be watched here at other times of the year.
To find out about the polo matches and where to buy tickets, visit the Argentine Polo Association website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the value of which is equivalent to the value of one British pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Port Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
Pounds sterling are generally accepted throughout the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
In remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; clarify in advance with the owners which method of payment is acceptable.
The Falkland Islands currency is almost impossible to exchange outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it has summer when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity creates a colder feel than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons here: the amount of precipitation is approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the nature is still wild, so you should not feed or disturb the animals.
The park advises: keep at least 100 yards/metres away from bears and wolves, and at least 25 yards/metres away from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they look, bison, moose, bears and virtually all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep the proper distance. These animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so respect their personal space.
Also, remember that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid cooking or carrying smelly foods, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The bay was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US and Britain refused to leave the bay.
All the ships sank, except for one British cruiser. About 200 American and German sailors died.
During the Mau movement's struggle for independence, a peaceful assembly in the town led to the killing of the supreme chief, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches here, as Auckland is located on the shores of two harbours. The most popular beaches are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of these beaches are sandy with safe swimming, and many of them are shaded by trees such as the hutukara.
In the central area of Auckland, where in the Waitemata Harbour are the prestigious residential suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, Tamaki Drive beaches stretch out.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the shore, and swimming is safe.
The most popular local beer is "Number One", it has a simple, pleasant and refreshing taste. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines that are drinkable, but New Zealand and Australian wines are better transported.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are still concerned, it is easy to find bottled water.
Australians don’t understand the idea of “flat white”. “Small black” is an espresso, cappuccino is served with a high layer of whipped cream (not foam), and tea without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Although fruit juices are expensive, they are of excellent quality.
There are a lot of trips to the reef all year round, and injuries caused by any of these reasons on the reef are rare.
Still, follow the recommendations of the authorities, obey all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Cubomedusa is found near beaches and river mouths north of 1770 from October to April, and sometimes outside this period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not lead an active life in the ocean, and their main habitat is the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking allows the traveler not to worry about where to stay upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, but you can book through a travel agent for other forms of accommodation, such as campsites.
Travel agents usually sell package deals that include breakfast, airport transfers or even combined packages that include flights and hotel accommodation.
They can also hold the reservation if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for the destination (e.g. a visa).
Any changes or requests must first be sent to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of attendees sleep on the festival grounds, and most consider it a mandatory part of the program.
If you want to be near the stage, you need to arrive early to find a campsite near the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages has finished, there may be areas at the festival where the music will continue to play late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter, find out about the location of your cabin, as going through the ice makes a pretty scary noise that can disturb the sleep of the most sensitive people.
St. Petersburg cruises include city tours. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to keep visitors inside and spending money, with no windows or clocks and exits that can be hard to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests happy and prevent them from leaving.
Some establishments offer free alcohol, but intoxication clouds the mind, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone travelling through high-altitude areas or mountain passes should be prepared for snow, ice or frost.
On an icy or snowy road, the friction is low and you won't be able to drive your car in the same way as on a regular asphalt road.
During a blizzard, enough snow to cause a traffic jam can fall in a very short period of time.
Visibility may also be restricted due to snow, sleet, fog, mist, or ice on the windshield.
On the other hand, snow and ice weather conditions are normal in many countries, and road traffic continues all year round with almost no interruptions.
A safari is probably the biggest drawcard for tourists in Africa and the main event for many travellers.
The term "safari" in everyday use means a land trip with the aim of seeing the stunning wildlife of Africa, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, often come close to cars, so even with normal equipment, you can get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better through binoculars.
Walking safari (also called "bush-bashing", "hiking safari" or "walking safari") consists of a hike lasting from several hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events taking place in different locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will become the only city in Asia to host the Summer Olympics twice; the first time was in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the date was postponed, you may be in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies may vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-related rules do not apply to July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a standard ticket price of around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes helps them dry. Many hotels rent out irons and ironing boards, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron to hand or aren't keen on the idea of wearing ironed socks, you can try a hairdryer if you have one.
Do not expose the fabric to too high temperatures (which can cause shrinkage or, in very rare cases, burns).
There are different ways to clean water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, it's enough to boil the water for a minute, in others it will take several minutes.
Filters are effective in different ways, and in case of doubts, you should think about buying water in sealed bottles and from a trustworthy company.
Travellers may encounter pests they have not seen in their home country.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, even worse, cause allergic reactions, release toxins or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can cause injury or death are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods without taxes and excise duties at certain points.
Travellers heading to high-tax countries can sometimes save a significant amount, especially on items such as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fermoyle has the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, often passing through isolated, desolate, and wooded terrain.
If you're not used to driving on rural roads, be aware that there are steep slopes, narrow alleys and sharp turns.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than on the previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than elsewhere.
Oddly enough, however, cell phone service is much better here than in many other parts of the route, such as Pennsylvania's Wilds.
German pastry is quite good, and in Bavaria it is plentiful and varied, and resembles the baking of their southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, apple cakes are available all year round, and cherries and plums appear in the summer.
Almonds, hazelnuts and other tree nuts are often used in German baking. Often, popular cakes are perfectly combined with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small, but filling, baked goods, try what is called, depending on the region, oladji or filled donuts.
Curry is a dish made from herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the liquid content, curry can be "dry" or "wet".
In the interior of Pakistan and northern India, yogurt is actively used in curry. In southern India and in certain regions on the coast of the subcontinent, coconut milk is usually used.
Indonesian cuisine, with 17,000 islands to choose from, is a general term used to describe the huge variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But without qualification, the term most commonly refers to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is now widespread throughout the archipelago, includes a range of unpretentious dishes. The Javanese people prefer additives such as peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are the supports for the rider's feet, hanging from both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with better stability, but there may be safety issues, as there is a risk of the foot getting stuck.
If the horse throws off the rider but the rider's foot is caught in the stirrup, the running horse may drag the rider along. To minimize this risk, a number of precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel, which have a smooth and fairly thin sole.
In addition, some saddles, especially English ones, are equipped with safety bars, which cause the leather stirrup to fall off the saddle if the rider falls back.
The Coquimbo Valley is the main destination in Chile for mountaineering. It is known as the Yosemite of South America and has a large number of large granite walls and rocks.
At the top, you can enjoy stunning mountain scenery, and rock climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes in its enormous potential for mountaineering.
Mountain winter sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending a snow-covered landscape on skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is the main tourist destination for many ski enthusiasts (sometimes called "ski bums") who plan their entire vacation around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old: rock paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.!
Skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Cross-country skiingThis activity is also called backcountry, skitouring or ski hiking.
It is related to, but usually does not include hiking up the peak and then skiing down unprepared slopes, as skiing across the plain requires stiffer skis and boots.
Imagine that the ski route is a hiking route.
In good conditions, you can cover a greater distance than when walking, but you can only develop such speed on skis in extremely rare cases when you don't have a heavy backpack and there is a marked ski trail.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it is home to many independent states. In ordinary circumstances, traveling through many countries would mean the need to apply for visas and go through passport control multiple times.
But the Schengen zone functions in this regard as a single country.
While in this zone, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for a visa in each of the Schengen countries separately, which will save you time and money, and avoid paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique, and some tax authorities define goods as antiques if they are 100 years old.
The concept has geographical variations, with the age limit in places such as North America being lower than in Europe.
Crafts can be defined as antiques, despite the fact that they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding this activity is also important to many other professions.
Although this is the tradition, not all members of the Saami people engaged in the mass breeding of reindeer; they lived on fishing, hunting and other similar occupations, using reindeer mainly as pack animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern professions, and tourism is an important source of income in the Sami region of Lapland.
Although the word "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Roma, it is often considered offensive because of associations with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Roma people.
If the country you are going to visit is subject to a travel warning, this may affect your travel health insurance or your cancellation insurance.
You may also want to consult other governments besides your own, but their advice is aimed at their own citizens.
Here's one example: U.S. citizens in the Middle East may face situations that Europeans or Arabs cannot.
The information reports only briefly describe the political situation in one country.
The opinions expressed are often superficial, vague and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information that is widely available.
Adverse weather conditions are a general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social upheaval or loss of life.
Adverse weather conditions are found all over the world, and they come in many different types, depending on geography, terrain, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall and forest fires are manifestations and effects of severe weather phenomena such as storms, tornadoes, waterspouts and hurricanes.
Regional and seasonal dangerous weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, and ice and dust storms.
Travellers are advised to take into account any risks associated with harsh weather in their area, as they may affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone must undergo professional training.
A search online for the phrase "hostile environment safety course" may yield the address of a local company.
In the course, all the topics covered here are usually dealt with in much more detail, often with practical training.
The course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, a large amount of first aid information, and sometimes training with weapons.
Books and magazines that tell about survival in the wild are common, but there are not many publications about war zones.
People planning to have gender reassignment surgery abroad should make sure they have valid documents for the return journey.
The readiness of governments to issue passports without a gender marker (X) or documents updated to reflect a preferred name and gender varies from place to place.
The willingness of foreign governments to meet their obligations under these instruments is similarly varied.
Security checks at checkpoints have also become much more thorough since the events of September 11, 2001.
Transgender people preparing for surgery should not expect to be able to go through scanners without their privacy and dignity being violated.
A rip current is a current created by waves that break on the shore, or sometimes on a reef or something similar.
The return flow is concentrated in several deeper areas, where rapid descent to great depths can occur, due to the similar underwater topography.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion when attempting to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back won't be any harder than usual.
Try to go somewhere where you won't be caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, you may want to wait for rescue.
The shock of returning home is earlier than the culture shock (here a shorter romantic period), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who are easily adaptable to new cultures sometimes find it especially difficult to re-adapt to their home culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you are adapted to a new culture and have lost some of the habits of your home culture.
When you first went abroad, people were likely to be patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adjust to a new country.
It may come as a surprise to people that patience and understanding are also required for travellers returning home.
The sound and light show against the backdrop of the pyramid is one of the most interesting events in this area for children.
The pyramids can be seen in the dark, and you can also see them in silence before the show begins.
There is always noise from tourists and vendors, and the story of sound and light is like a book of stories.
The Sphinx acts as a backdrop and narrator for a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
Several countries lay claim to the South Shetland Islands, which were first opened in 1819. The islands are home to the largest number of bases, and in 2020, sixteen were operational.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers from the peninsula. The largest island is named after King George, with the settlement of Villa las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the submerged caldera of an active volcano forms an impressive natural harbour.
The land of the Antarctic Peninsula is the area to the south of the Antarctic Peninsula, washed by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of this peninsula here merge with the plateau, and then rise again and form the 360-kilometer-long Elsworth mountain range, divided by the Minnesota glacier into two parts.
In the north, that is, on the Sentinele Range, are the highest mountains of Antarctica - the Vinson Massif, the highest point of which reaches 4892 m and is called Vinson Peak.
In remote areas beyond cell phone range, a satellite phone may be your only option.
As a rule, a satellite phone is not a replacement for a mobile phone, since you need to be outside in a direct line of sight with the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used in shipping, including leisure and high-speed vessels, where there is a need for remote data and voice communication.
As a rule, you will be able to obtain additional information about connecting this service by contacting your local telephone operator.
An option that is becoming increasingly popular for those planning to take a gap year is to travel and study.
This is especially popular among high school graduates, allowing them to take a year off before starting university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, studying abroad during an academic break can indeed boost your chances of getting into a top university back home.
As a rule, tuition fees are charged when enrolling in such educational programs.
Finland is an excellent place for boating. In the "land of a thousand lakes", there are also thousands of islands on the lakes and in the archipelagos off the coast.
When exploring archipelagos or visiting lakes, you can easily manage without a yacht.
While the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes can accommodate any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks leave a completely different impression.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for seven or eight people.
A similar situation is seen in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in other cases it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands this figure is between one and forty).
Most Baltic cruises include an overnight stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can spend several full days in this historic city, but you will have to return to the ship to sleep.
If you only go ashore on a ship excursion, you don't need a separate visa (since 2009).
Berlin, Germany is featured in some cruise brochures. As you can see on the map at the top, Berlin is far from the sea and the visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying can be daunting for anyone of any age or social status, especially if it's their first flight or if they've had a traumatic experience in the past.
There's no shame in that: it's no different from personal dislike and fear of other things that many people have.
Understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome the fear that arises from uncertainty or a lack of control.
Delivery services are well paid for fast delivery. Often, the speed of delivery of commercial documentation, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs is very important.
Some routes have their own planes for the larger companies, but for other routes and smaller companies, this has been a problem.
If they shipped anything as air cargo, some routes could take days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to get it dealt with more quickly is to send it as checked baggage. The airline's regulations do not allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, so you need to be involved here.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay for the privilege (or, better yet, get your company to pay for you).
However, it is not cheap at all - according to experience, you will pay four times more for business class than for economy class and eleven times more for first class!
As a rule, there is no point in even looking for discounts on business class or first class for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay a premium for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, which is why they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multinational republic that has fallen victim to an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between the two parts of Moldova have been restored.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is Turkey's third-largest city with a population of around 3.7 million, the largest port after Istanbul and a major transport hub.
The once ancient city of Smyrna today is a modern, developed and bustling commercial center, located along a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
Broad boulevards, glass-fronted modern buildings and shopping centres are interspersed with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, old mosques and churches, although the city has more of a Mediterranean European feel than traditional Turkey.
From the village of Halldorsvik, there is a view of the nearby Esturay island, and there is also an unusual octagonal church located there.
There are interesting marble sculptures of doves on the church cemetery over some graves.
It is worth taking half an hour to take a walk around this unusual village.
Not far to the north is the romantic and charming town of Sintra, celebrated by Lord Byron and since then known throughout the world.
The Scotturb bus number 403 makes regular trips to Sintra and stops at the Cabo da Roca.
To the north, also visit the great Temple of Our Lady of Fatima (mausoleum) - the site of world-famous apparitions of the Virgin Mary.
Please remember that you are, in principle, standing on a place of a common grave, as well as a place that is unspeakably important for a significant percentage of the inhabitants of the globe.
There are many more men and women alive who survived their time here, but there are even more people whose loved ones were killed here or worked to death here, whether Jewish or of other nationalities.
Please treat this place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Don't joke about the Holocaust and the Nazis.
Don't deface this place by spraying or scratching graffiti on the objects around it.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the majority understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as it is the first official language by law.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other public places.
The usual announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unscheduled interruptions are announced by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known to be self-centered, rude and arrogant.
While it is often just a false stereotype, the best way to succeed in Paris is to behave in the best possible way, as a "bien élevé" (well-bred) person. This will significantly facilitate adaptation in this city.
The unfriendly appearance of Parisians will immediately disappear if you show a little basic politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mostly with beech, spruce and pine, and is a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a combination of microclimates, different soils and altitude differences, it is home to a particularly wide variety of plant communities.
The area is teeming with a huge variety of animals and birds.
Here you can meet rare representatives of the fauna, for example, the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and capercaillie, as well as many other common species of animals.
When visiting monasteries, women must be dressed in skirts below the knee and with their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries will provide robes for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in a particularly bright color, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men must wear pants that cover their knees.
They can also be rented at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after each use, so you might feel uncomfortable in these skirts. One size fits all men!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on vegetables, bread and meat (especially pork), with olive oil used throughout.
A simple and popular lunch dish, especially in the summer, is pa amb oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any filling you have on hand, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word Sie, meaning You, are always written with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
It is important to distinguish between verbs and adverbs.
This also makes reading easier, while writing is somewhat more complicated by the need to determine whether a verb or adjective is being used in the substantivized form.
Italian pronunciation is relatively simple, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are spelled.
You should be especially careful with the letters c and g, as their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel.
Don't forget that r and rr are pronounced differently: caro means "expensive", and carro means "cart".
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this Persian grammar textbook will help you learn a lot of new things and better understand expressions.
Obviously, if you speak a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish may hastily conclude that Portuguese is similar enough and can be learned separately.
Ancient observatories are generally considered obsolete today and serve as museums or educational institutions.
Since light pollution wasn't as much of a problem during their heyday, they're usually located in cities or on campuses that are easier to get to than those built in our time.
Most modern research telescopes are huge structures in remote locations with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The contemplation of the cherry blossom, called "hanami", entered Japanese culture back in the 8th century.
The idea came from China, where the favorite flower was plum blossom.
In Japan, the first celebrations of the sakura blossoming were arranged by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so don't be tempted to take even one specimen.
Collecting "samples" in an officially organised garden will also get you thrown out without a word.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to be, easy to navigate, and almost everything can be bought upon arrival.
But, being in the "deep tropics" only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to cope with both heat (constantly) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
There are also several buses heading north to Hebron, the legendary burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, as well as their wives.
Make sure the bus you are getting on is going to Hebron and not just the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways could be a good theme for any celebration.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, a cruise along the Danube sights, or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also identify routes for popular walking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night, without going to bed, in some open place to see the sunrise.
Of course, this tradition has a Christian theological explanation, but it could also be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold Easter services on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with worshippers usually starting the celebration of Christ's resurrection at midnight.
All the animals that originally arrived on these islands got here by swimming, flying or being washed up by the tide.
Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to reach the islands, making the giant tortoise the primary herbivore on the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans arrived on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you will experience a polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This presents a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, because the sky will be more or less dark for 24 hours.
As these areas are sparsely populated, and as a result light pollution is often not an issue, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
The costumes are standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by their last name or by their title.
Harmony in the workplace is extremely important, and the results of group work are valued above individual achievements.
Typically, workers must obtain permission from their supervisor before making any decisions and are required to carry out their supervisor's orders without question.
