Despite the fact that an experimental vaccine has been found that can reduce mortality from the Ebola virus, so far no medication has demonstrated a clear effect in treating the existing infection.
The ZMapp antibody cocktail initially showed promising results in this area, but official studies have shown that it has less benefit in preventing death than previously expected.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as the control, meaning scientists used it as a baseline and compared it to three other treatments.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the US Olympic Committee and agrees with the absolute necessity of creating a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the statement by the USOC that it is in the best interests of our athletes, clubs, and their sports to pursue reforms within our organization rather than to revoke its certification.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely accepted theory, but also provides details that are usually not obtainable from fossil remains, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut-brown on top and either pale or had carotenoid pigmentation on the bottom.
The find also allows us to learn about the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the feathers of dinosaurs lack a well-developed stem called rachis, but there are still other distinctive features - barbules and barbicels - researchers have concluded that the rachis most likely appeared later through the evolutionary development of other distinctive features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation and display. The researchers suggested that although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample represents adult plumage, not the down of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, despite the fact that it is the tail of a young dinosaur, this specimen has the plumage of an adult, and not the down of a chick.

They found that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: it was established that the activity of all stars in the system is determined by their brightness, rotation, and nothing else.
The combination of luminosity and rotation is used to determine the Rossby number of the star, associated with the plasma flow.
The fewer Rossby numbers, the less active the star is in relation to magnetic field inversions.

Commons administrator Adam Cuerden expressed his frustration with the removals in a conversation last month with Wikinews.
"He [Wales] essentially lied to us from the beginning, first by acting as if it was necessary to do so for legal reasons, and second by pretending to listen to us right up until his removal of the images."
The public outcry has led to efforts to develop guidelines for sexual content on the site, which hosts millions of open-licensed media.
The work carried out was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the galaxy in Sagittarius.
The effect that the team was looking for may be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon attracts the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way affects the galaxy in Sagittarius.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way as with ordinary matter.
According to this theory, a significant portion of dark matter around the Galaxy is arranged in the form of a halo and consists of a large number of small particles.

During research in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal, Dr. Tony Moll managed to discover tuberculosis with exceptionally high resistance to drugs (XDR-TB).
In an interview, he said that the new strain "is a very big concern because it leads to a very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have been infected in the hospital, Dr. Moll thinks, and at least two were health care workers at the hospital.
In one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 people through close contact.
However, the percentage of people with multi-drug resistant TB in the overall group of TB patients still seems low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 currently infected in South Africa.

According to infrared images, the difference in night and day temperatures suggests that they are most likely caves.
During the day they are colder than the surrounding surface, and at night they are warmer.
Their thermal characteristics are not as stable as those of large caves on Earth, which often maintain an almost constant temperature, but they are consistent with what is found in deep pits in the ground, said Glen Cushing of the Planetary Geology Division of the U.S. Geological Survey and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally conducted using low-tech methods: the voter closes themselves in a booth and puts a pre-printed piece of paper indicating the chosen candidate in an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
France's election laws are quite strict in terms of systematizing procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that at the beginning of the vote there are no envelopes inside and that no other envelopes have been added to them, except for the envelopes of those people who were allowed to participate in the vote and whose votes were counted properly.
Candidates can send their representatives to monitor the entire process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision according to a special procedure.

Schneider testified via video link from a US Air Force base in his home country.
In addition to Wednesday's competition, Carpendo has competed in two individual events at the championships.
Her first competition was a slalom, in the first run of which she did not make it to the finish line. 36 out of 116 participants had the same result in that race.
In another race, this time in the giant slalom, she finished tenth among women in the sitting position with a combined time of 4:41.30. She was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place finisher, Austrian Claudia Lesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place finisher, Hungarian Diengyi Dani.
Four skiers in the women's sitting group failed to complete their runs, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to finish the race.
The police in the state of Madhya Pradesh returned the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said, "We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and returned her mobile phone and laptop to her."
The accused have the names of Baba Kandjar, Bhuva Kandjar, Rampro Kandjar and Vishnu Kandjar.
Police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused were presented before the judges with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the building at the moment when the car crashed into it, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Subsequently, the Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged Adekoya with the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting charges and trial, but any testimony could be tainted because her celebrity was widely exploited by the media.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice works differently, and the courts found the publication of the photos to be potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line by publishing photographs and other details of suspects".
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is responsible for prosecutions, told reporters that no further comment would be made, at least until a verdict is reached.
The document, according to the leak, will concern the dispute over the borders that Palestine wants to establish based on those that existed before the start of the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other topics reportedly include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both peoples, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PA agrees to maintain such a presence for only five years.
The hunters who participated in the additional test on pest control had to be under the close supervision of rangers, since this test was being monitored and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
As part of the partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia (NSW), the Sporting Shooters' Association recruited qualified volunteers for the hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of parks and heritage conservation at the Wildlife and National Parks Service, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation underwent comprehensive training and safety instruction.
Yesterday, Martiyev swore in a new Temporary Electoral Council (TEC), consisting of nine members.
This is Martiya's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the previous interim electoral council resign as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the mass protests against the state regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were caused by the non-implementation of elections, some of which were due to take place as far back as 2011.
There were about 60 cases of overheating of defective iPod devices, resulting in six fires and four people with minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 cases related to these devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Labor and Industry announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called "not serious."
In response, the ministry called Apple's delay in reporting "very regrettable".
At 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday) an earthquake occurred in Mariana.
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said there were no reports of damage in the territory.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer hijacked a tourist bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and took Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages were rescued, and at least six were confirmed dead at this time.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers took the place of the elderly woman, as she had gone to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Following in his father's footsteps, Liggins began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and gynaecologist and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
When Liggins was working at the hospital, in his free time he began investigating cases of premature births.
His research showed that if the hormone is administered, it will accelerate the maturation of the child's lungs during fetal development.
As Xinhua reports, on Wednesday, state investigators discovered two flight recorders, or, in other words, "black boxes".
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to the Moon.
Here's what Tommy Dreamer said: "The Moon was the first Queen of Extreme. She was my first manager. The Moon passed away on the night of two moons. This is such a unique event, just like she was herself. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Rhodes said: "The Moon was as plague-ridden as I am... Perhaps even more plague-ridden... I love her and will miss her... I hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed ahead of the 2010 federal election, the number opposed to Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 per cent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard during the 2010 federal election campaign expressed the view that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34% of those surveyed share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
The survey showed the following: 29 percent of respondents are convinced that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that it does not need this form of government.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness is now in doubt due to his complaints.
He was unable to take the medication necessary to alleviate the pain, as it is banned in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, on January 25 discovered the largest prime number known to date.
On Tuesday, it was announced that by the beginning of February, several people had confirmed this discovery using various hardware and software.
Perhaps comets were the source of water delivery to Earth, as well as the source of organic substances that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
The 53-year-old Cuomo began his tenure as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called these rumors "political chatter and nonsense."
It is expected that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the US Federal Aviation Administration, will allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel annually, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology instead of the old technology based on ground-based radar, which will allow air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the position of aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport has been launched to Wembley, no ground trains will stop there, in addition, there are no parking lots or transfer parking lots on the surface.
Concerns about the lack of transportation have raised the possibility that the game may have to be played behind closed doors without fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science describes the emergence of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden) reported that due to the mating of the endemic Darwin's finch (Geospiza fortes) with the migrated cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris), a new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process would take much longer.
Gold can be given any shape. It can be cast into very small forms.
It can be drawn into thin wire, which can be twisted and plated. It can be stamped or rolled into coils.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books - the so-called "face manuscript".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH value is determined by the degree of saturation of the hydrogen ions (H in pH) of the chemical compound being studied.
Hydrogen ions are protons, from which electrons are separated (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
To make a new mixture, mix two dry powders in one container, and then roll a ball out of this mixture with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the top layer, which will be unusual, then a kind of shell will form.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flushing toilet connected to a complex sewage system.
Preserved fragments of sewer systems were discovered in the houses of Minoan cities on the islands of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also present in Ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women bathed together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and almost instantly reflects it back down.
The satellite was delivered into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and view to some extent.
A giant rocket over 100 feet tall is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has incredibly changed our world. The most important thing that the wheel has done for us is to give us much easier and faster transportation.
It gave us the train, the automobile, and many other means of transportation.
Beneath them are larger numbers of medium-sized cats, which eat smaller prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including house cats) eat and hunt much more numerous small animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the concept of a niche, the special work that each type of cat performs, which keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
A pride consists of one to three adult males who are related, as well as females and cubs, the number of which can reach thirty.
Females are usually related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave very similarly to packs of wolves or dogs – animals that, in their habits, are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) and are also very dangerous to their prey.
As a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb trees (although not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with the strength of five strong men.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that have the ability to roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like the shouting of sentences from unintelligible words.
Cheetahs love to eat small animals. If the opportunity arises, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that the cheetah hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that cougars follow the trail of animals and find prey by smell, tracking its movements on the ground with their sense of smell.
They are excellent at seeing in the dark with night vision and can move almost invisibly. Cheetahs stalk their prey, blending in with their surroundings, and then pounce on their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they came (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or changes compared to what it had before in order to become a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed at all — it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it starts to look less and less like the rest of the population.
Over time, after thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that it will not be possible to say that they are the same species.
We call this process speciation, that is, the emergence of new species. Speciation is a necessary consequence and an extremely important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants feed on the sun through photosynthesis, and they also cast shadows.
We build our houses and make our clothes from plants. Most of our food is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the most fearsome predator of its time, so it feared no one except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, and it had an extra row on the roof of its mouth, so there was no escape for those who crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that his tongue was forked. He ate turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and may have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; not even a giant dinosaur like a Tyrannosaurus would have stood a chance against it.
Despite the fact that most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans still had their own strange and unusual dishes served during feasts. For example, wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a ground squirrel.
There was another difference: while poor people and women ate while sitting on chairs, the rich liked to have communal feasts during which they ate while lying on their sides.
The diet of ancient Romans could not have included foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
In particular, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main sanctuary for each of the gods, which was considered the god's dwelling place.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to please the gods' wishes at ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called "zikkurats" were built as elements of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not of particular importance.
Most of the Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; the shops had open counters facing the street. Stone was used for building houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Scandinavian sagas tell of how Eric the Red was expelled from Iceland for murder, and, moving further west, he discovered Greenland and gave it its name.
But regardless of his discovery, tribes of Eskimos were already living there at that time.
Although each of the countries was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the peoples, rulers, traditions, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence was a map to treasure.
However, this is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence it says: "This Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776". The text is written at the bottom of the document and upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence, this large parchment document (29¾ by 24½ inches) was folded for more convenient storage.
So it's quite possible that the entry was added simply as a note.
As a result of Operation Neptune and subsequent battles, the north of France was liberated, but the south was still not liberated.
It was under the control of "Vichy" French, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of opposing them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the southern part of France. The invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just 2 weeks, the forces of Free France and the Americans liberated southern France and headed towards Germany.
Civilization is a separate culture, whose carriers are a fairly large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin civilis, which means "civil" and is related to the Latin words civis, meaning "citizen," and civitas, meaning "city" or "city-state," and it also expresses in a certain way the size of a society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. Civilizational culture implies the transfer of knowledge through several generations, an uninterrupted cultural presence and a continuously spreading influence.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving corresponding historical evidence, and therefore cannot be recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the American War of Independence, thirteen states, in accordance with the Articles of Confederation, first formed a weak central government, the only body of which was the Congress.
The Congress had no authority to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on the states, which often refused to cooperate and declined to enforce its acts.
He also did not have the power to overturn state tax laws and tariffs.
According to the articles, amendments require unanimous approval from all states, but the states were so irresponsible towards the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions. Residents of these regions in Italy participate in international competitions and the Olympics.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to its belonging to the cluster/group of islands, Japan is often called an archipelago from a geographical point of view.
Taiwan's origins date back many years, to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of indigenous grain production methods and hiring Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after its defeat in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, by which it ceded Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a more accurate idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored. Restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common format in the world for static photographs is 35 mm, and this size was the dominant size of film at the end of the analog era.
Today it is still produced, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by the dimensions of digital camera images.
The 35mm format is actually a bit confusing, it is 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get a ratio with small whole numbers) is therefore accepted as 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are equal to or closely approximate these proportions.
The much-used and often derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while still maintaining a sense of order in the image.
It states that the main object should be placed at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under intense scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity united European states despite differences in languages and traditions.
Its pervasive power touched everyone - from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds exist for this purpose.
The center of church authority has been based in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth has led many to question whether this dogma is being upheld.
Soon after the start of hostilities, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This strategy proved effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated universally accepted international laws enshrined in several international agreements over the past two hundred years.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sectors of the oceans, endangering even neutral ships.
As the response to this tactic was muted, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
Among the majority of citizens and nations in the 1920s, sentiments such as pacifism and isolation prevailed.
Having experienced the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, states wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America, and accepted an offer to work for the Edison company in the city of New York.
He came to the US with four cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, who had been his boss at his previous job, to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, a unique way of designating periods of time was used; each stage of China or each family in power was a special dynasty.
Furthermore, between the reigns of each dynasty, there was fragmentation and instability. The most famous was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years during the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, there were fierce military actions between many noble people fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms era was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting for a place on the throne in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many such social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, work opportunities opened up for all men, which allowed the most ambitious and talented to achieve success.
The same applies to the army, because ranks are now based on qualities, not on origin.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed members of the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in topics not related to worldly life. He often visited a cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain "Nur" (light) for contemplation.
Well, the cave that has survived to this day gives us a very clear idea of the spiritual aspirations of Muhammad.
The cave is located on the top of a mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It is very difficult to find, even for someone who knows about its existence. In the cave, a person is completely isolated.
You can see nothing but the pure beautiful sky above your head and the many surrounding mountains. From the depths of the cave, you can see and hear only a very small part of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that exists today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC and is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the memory of the pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the Giza Necropolis, in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and relatives.
The upward movement of the bow looks like a V, and the downward movement of the bow looks like a bracket or a square without a bottom side.
"Up" means you start at the tip and move the bow forward, and "down" means you start where your hand is holding the bow and move it back.
The movement of the bow upwards usually produces a softer sound, while the movement of the bow downwards produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
You can draw your own stems, but remember that the stems are printed for musical reasons and it is usually best to follow them.
On October 6, 1789, an angry mob of women from the market forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister Madame Elizabeth to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted threats at the king and queen.
A crowd of people forced the King and Queen to open the windows wide.
At one point, one member of the crowd waved a royal guard's head, killed in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The military expenses of American imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the expenses and interest on bond loans moved on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the superprofits brought by the long exploitation of the Filipinos constituted the main income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era in which these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history covering the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages replaced the earlier Middle Ages and preceded the late Middle Ages, which, according to the accepted view, ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of practical ideas, from technological progress or technological imperative to the strict view that the fundamental logic associated with the laws of science and their manifestation in technology drives the fate of people.
Most views on technological determinism share two common ideas: that the direction of technological development is practically impervious to cultural or political influence and that, in turn, the "impact" of technology on society is determined by its own properties, rather than by society.
For example, one could say that the automobile is the necessary cause of the development of roads.
However, the nationwide road network is economically unprofitable only for a small group of vehicles, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increase in the number of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new methods of treatment for injuries in the healthcare industry.
Romanticism largely included cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time, customs and culture emerged that, in harmony with the society's place of residence, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is called the capital of fashion in the modern world, Constantinople was considered the capital of fashion during the feudal times of Europe.
The fame of it as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined throughout the twelfth century mainly because the crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more highly than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
It was at this point that the title of Fashion Capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West can lag behind by 25-30 years.
Own styles began to develop in Western Europe by the end of the Middle Ages. One of the greatest achievements of that time, thanks to the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothing.
Natural farming is farming conducted to produce enough food to meet the needs of only the farmer and his/her family.
Natural farming is a simple, often organic, farming system that uses seeds from plants that grow in a particular ecosystem, along with the use of crop rotation and other relatively simple methods to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers have engaged in agriculture for subsistence purposes, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel oppressed by society's standards, and allow such people to define themselves.
There may be differences between subcultures, depending on the age, nationality, social status, place of residence and/or gender of the people who make up the subculture.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a particular subculture often declare their affiliation through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to illustrate several unfortunate cases where children, due to a lack of proper attention, unfortunate circumstances, or intentional mistreatment, did not have contact with adults during their development.
Such children are called "feral" or "wild". Some feral children have been isolated by humans (usually their own parents). In some cases, such abandonment of a child was the result of the parents' inability to accept their child's serious intellectual or physical disability.
Children living on the streets may have experienced severe forms of violence or trauma before running away or being abandoned.
Others, it is claimed, were raised by animals; some of them lived in the wild on their own.
If he is completely raised by animals instead of humans, a feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limitations) that are similar in almost every way to the specific animal that raised him - for example, his fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should be simpler and more engaging, scaffolding is ahead of many technologies.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather a form of assistance for those going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is Screencastify in Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolding, which helps with learning, is built into the software and is designed to remind, explain and ask questions about procedures that the learner might find too difficult to handle alone.
Children are placed under guardianship for a variety of reasons: from homelessness to abuse and even extortion.
Children should never grow up in an environment where they are not provided with care, education and upbringing, but they do.
We believe the foster care system is safe for children.
Our foster care system should provide safe housing, loving foster parents, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should provide for all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the approach to use and satisfaction.
Thus, it has been suggested that "learning" and "socialization" are important motivating factors for Internet use (James et al., 1995)
"Personal involvement" and "long-term contact" were also identified by Ammi and McCord (1998) as new dimensions of motivation when they studied how people respond to Web sites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the field of interpreting microexpressions – facial movements lasting several milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting their microexpressions.
In the article "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks described how people who, due to brain damage, are unable to understand speech, nevertheless can correctly assess the sincerity of the speaker.
According to his assumption, animals, such as domestic dogs, may possess similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
Studies conducted in the twentieth century showed that there are two types of genetic variability: hidden and expressed.
Mutation introduces a new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the set of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle the variations between the two pools with each generation.
In the savannah, primates with a digestive system like that of humans find it difficult to meet their amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so will lead to serious consequences such as stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most accessible plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but they are poorly digested by primates like us unless they are cooked.
On the contrary, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also represents a rich source of proteins containing all the main amino acids.
Taking all of the above into account, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees in the savannah do to this day.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during normal sleep and falling back asleep after a short time (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily done with a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options that are based on biological rhythms include drinking large amounts of fluid (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which makes a person get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the voltage, the more positive the vital force present in you. Every person is potentially given the ability to find absolute peace and a sense of satisfaction.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negative attitude.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been supplemented with the Mahayana path of love and a variety of techniques from Indian yoga.
The principle of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-consuming love.
Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) in kundalini yoga is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The heart of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of Deities. Through visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightenment of consciousness is achieved.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war ended, disagreements regarding the system, process, and culture led to discord between the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years, with real wars fought using proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places around the world.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been breached, and the only hope was retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became irrelevant practically overnight when about 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after seizing the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for transporting goods is, without a doubt, the most effective way to transport large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The job of the sailors has traditionally been to ensure the country's ability to move its people and goods, while simultaneously impeding the enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was a company in the North Atlantic during World War II. The Americans were trying to move people and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly its submarines, tried to stop this movement.
If the anti-Hitler coalition had failed, Germany would most likely have been able to conquer Britain, just like the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for the sake of having milk, wool, meat, and skin at hand.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed over hills or other grazing areas, which were often tended by goat-herders, who were usually children or teenagers, much like the more common activity of shepherding. These grazing methods are still used today.
Roads for carriages were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the cart tracks were simply parallel planks of wood, they allowed horses to carry larger loads and at a faster speed than the slightly more rutted roads of the time.
The sleepers were introduced a long time ago to keep the rails in place, but it later became clear that the tracks were more effective with an iron top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Over time, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron appeared.
The first known form of transportation was walking on foot, people started walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
For their australopithecine ancestors, bipedalism was not so common.
Bipedal specialization is found in the remains of Australopithecus from the period of 4.2–3.9 million years ago, although, perhaps, Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living by caring more about the environment. We can become members of the environmental movement and even activists to alleviate further suffering, even if it is just a little bit.
As a rule, it is similar to treating symptoms. If we need more than just a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problem and eliminate it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot under the influence of human scientific and technological progress, and due to overpopulation and people's extravagant lifestyle, problems have become more widespread.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, the handwritten draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
150-200 copies were produced overnight, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of this document was done by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
On July 6, one copy was sent to George Washington, who on July 9 ordered it to be read to his troops in New York. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dundas leaflets known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript copy has not survived.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lived to our days. We call them birds.
They are often not considered dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there is still much to be said about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have scales on their paws and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on processing information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, that is, 0 or 1. These numbers are called "binary digits" or "bits" if we use computer jargon.
It can be difficult to identify oral poisoning right away. Symptoms like vomiting are too common to make a quick diagnosis.
The best sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicine or a toxic household chemical.
Read the label, which provides special instructions for first aid in case of poisoning with this particular poison.
The term "beetle" is used by entomologists formally to denote a group of insects.
This concept comes from the bedbugs known since ancient times – insects that are perfectly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both predators and bed bugs are nest-dwelling species adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States, approximately 400 thousand cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) have been detected, making multiple sclerosis the leading neurological disease among young people and middle-aged people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to suffer from multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their interests or the interests of their child.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption or fostering, biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take the child.
The main goal of science is to figure out how the world works by applying the scientific method. This method is actually the basis of most scientific research.
It is, however, not the only one. Scientific research is also guided by experimentation (an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses), asking questions, and conducting observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused their attention on ancient texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
In all scientific matters, including psychology, the views of Aristotle were adopted.
As knowledge of the Greek language deteriorated, the West found itself cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, not simply a response to external periodic stimuli, have been recorded in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to cycle autonomously over a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the first suggestions that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase implanted their DNA into the bacterium using phages, i.e. viruses.
They conducted two experiments, labeling the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus and the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can cause a wide variety of outcomes, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected stretch of genetic material, and whether the mutated cells are germ line cells.
Only mutations in germ line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is interesting for those who like to go to nature to enjoy the landscape, including wild animals and plants.
Examples of active recreation at the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small towns in rural areas to go to their workplaces, and those who work in the place they just left drive past them.
In this active transportation movement, everyone is connected to, and supports, the personal automobile-based transportation system in one way or another.
Now science indicates that the vast hydrocarbon economy has disrupted one of the stable states of the biosphere that has sustained human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone is a member of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about these systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear such complaints about water quality or falling bridges.
Why are there so many complaints about transport systems, why do they break down every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or are there more fundamental reasons for this?
The study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other is carried out as part of the study of transport flows.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the intensity of motor vehicle traffic because it is impossible to predict the driver's behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers is often quite systematic; thus, traffic flows as a whole have some systematicity and can be approximately described mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships were established between three main variables: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of railway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them to escape from enemies more easily, find food and partners.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their body, which gives them an advantage.
This provides them with more hiding places to escape from predators.
Dragonflies and damselflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Many believed he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
That seems like a reasonable idea, because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times the amount of water compared to the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with a width sometimes reaching six miles.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers of our planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. Thousands of smaller rivers flow into it.
Despite the fact that the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the pyramids in Giza were never surpassed.
In the new kingdom of the ancient Egyptians, they admired the monuments created by their predecessors more than a thousand years ago.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. This is the smallest independent country in the world, as well as the country with the smallest population.
In the Vatican, Italian is used in legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language for most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Catholics.
The basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver and copper, have been known to people since ancient times, since they can all be found in nature in their pure form and can be relatively easily extracted using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
They were like the four states of matter (in that order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, though he also suggested that they transition into a new state to make what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
It is also possible to make alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of the smallest particles, called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them can fit in the dot at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil became a good friend for many people when it first appeared.
It is sad that when new ways of writing appeared, the pencil lost its former status and it became less popular.
Nowadays people write messages on computer screens and they never have to deal with a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard with the advent of newer technologies.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that in order for many protons and neutrons to be in one nucleus, energy is required.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, and then the nuclear fission releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means they tend to decay with or without a little push.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km under the oceans and 100 km under the continents.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more lunar seas on the visible side because the crust is thinner there. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what makes people act or what might interest them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that accumulate within them during the process of growing up.
These theories address what makes specific individuals want to do what they do and what their surroundings make them do or not do.
Two popular theories about content are the "Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs" and the "Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory of Motivation".
Typically, two types of behavior can manifest when managers start to lead people who were previously their equals in status. One extreme of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
It is difficult for such managers to make unpopular decisions, take disciplinary measures, evaluate work results, distribute responsibilities, and hold employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes an unrecognizable individual who thinks he has to change everything the team did and take credit for it.
After all, the manager is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to conflicts between leaders and the rest of the team members.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are some differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They are usually more autonomous than employees from traditional teams, because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not always be understood by local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is a team of leaders, to whom each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why should an organization go through the laborious process of creating a learning organization? One of the purposes of applying the concept of learning organizations in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used in all functional units of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Ultimately, the organization's concerted effort to overcome the obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that will meet the customer's interests.
Before an organization can become innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and learning.
Angle (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of effectiveness.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of consciousness. This narrows the scope of the study, and it becomes much more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is used by scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, injuries, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen structures and processes of the brain.
This provides us with a large amount of data and materials for creating simulation models that help us understand the processes taking place in our consciousness.
Despite the fact that AI is firmly associated with science fiction, it forms a very important area of computer science, which considers the behavior and training of machines and "imparting" them intelligence.
Research in the field of AI includes the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Here are some examples that can be cited: control, planning and scheduling, response to client diagnoses and questions, as well as recognition of faces, handwriting and voice.
Such issues are highlighted in separate disciplines, the purpose of which is to solve the problems we face in everyday life.
Currently, the AI system is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, being built into some software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are very important for any class. Very often, teachers want to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The technology offers a solution in the form of virtual tours. Students can explore museum exhibits, visit an aquarium or enjoy fine art, all while sitting with their class.
Posting the excursion in a virtual space for all to see is also a great way to refresh the memory of the excursion and share your acquired knowledge with future classes.
For example, each year, students at Bennett High School in North Carolina create a website about their visit to the state capital, and each year the website is updated, but access to the old versions is still preserved – they serve as a memory album.
Blogging can also improve students' writing skills. Although students often start their blogs using poor grammar and spelling, this usually changes due to the presence of an audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog author starts to strive for improvement in their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, by blogging, "students begin to better understand the world around them." Students are inspired to be smart and interesting, attracting readers' attention (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that fosters collaboration and motivates students to extend the learning process far beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can give students the opportunity to become more analytical and critical. By actively responding to online materials, students can determine their position in the context of other people's work, as well as express their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming bilingual capital of Canada with a huge number of art galleries and museums that reveal the past and present of Canada.
Further south is Niagara Falls, while the north is the domain of the unspoiled natural beauty of the Muskoka and surrounding areas.
All of this and much more makes Ontario something truly Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and some of them are practically uninhabited wilderness.
A surprising population comparison: there are more African Americans in the US than there are citizens in Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is much larger than others and is a unique continent in terms of wildlife.
Almost all of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to this region, especially on the Comoros and Mayotte.
The spread of European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a route around the Cape of Good Hope from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west, by the Atlantic Ocean.
For women: all female tourists are advised to say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that due to cultural differences, they may feel like they are being harassed, women are often followed, taken by the hand and so on.
Firmly refuse men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (this is unacceptable regardless of cultural differences!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE. It was used by the Romans, Phoenicians and Merinids as a strategic port, called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city, which was called Ed-Dar-el-Beyda, and the Spanish traders who established trading bases here called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in the whole of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it's easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of trinkets are sold, but all of this is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, on the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the central part of the city.
Although Goma is a relatively safe place, it is advisable to check in advance for any travel outside Goma to understand the state of the fighting in the North Kivu province.
This city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, and it is also possible to see mountain gorillas in the wild at one of the cheapest prices in Africa.
You can go to Goma by mototaxi. The usual (local) price is 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu became a metaphor for the exotic faraway land.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, but its reputation attracts tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites under threat due to the danger from the sands of the desert.
One of the most important stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS series "African American Lives" was made here.
This city is very different from other cities in the country, as it is dominated by Arab rather than African culture.
Kruger National Park is located in northeastern South Africa, along the border with Mozambique in the east, with Zimbabwe in the north, and the Crocodile River serves as its southern border.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km²; it is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which is home to different wild animals.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there is a daily fee for the protection and maintenance of the park.
It may also be beneficial to buy a Wild Card, which allows you to visit South African national parks either selectively or all at once.
The territory of Hong Kong was named after the island of Hong Kong, a place that many tourists consider to be the main object of their attention.
The line of buildings forming the Hong Kong skyline is compared to a shimmering bar chart, accentuated by the water of Victoria Harbour.
To see the most picturesque places in Hong Kong, you should leave the island and head to the coast of the Zhuilu Mountain Peninsula, which is located opposite.
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development areas are concentrated on reclaimed land on the northern shore.
This is a place that British colonizers took for themselves, and if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove belt, stretching from the coast 80 km (50 miles) inland in Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A part of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
These forests are not just mangrove swamps - they also include some of the last remaining mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometers, of which about a third is covered with water or swamps.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife reserve, and, according to available estimates, 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer currently live on its territory.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since intercity buses are often overcrowded, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and reliable.
The bus is a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places like Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
These two towers reach 83 meters in height, and the bridge itself is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.5 meters wide.
The height of the underpass is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
According to the plan, the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs inspection points are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting the area now occupied by eastern Paraguay, they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region served as home to different groups of local tribes, such as the Guaycuru and Payaguá, who survived through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, which was previously called the "great province of the East Indies", emerged as a result of the clash between Spanish conquerors and local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has largely managed to preserve much of its distinctive character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams, as well as the best players in the world in a sport like polo.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
To find out about polo matches and where to buy tickets for them, check out the website of the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the value of which is equivalent to the value of one British pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on these islands, which is located in Port Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands. Credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards may not be accepted on remote islands, although British and American currency may be accepted; clarify with the owners in advance which method of payment is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely drops below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity creates a feeling of colder weather than what the thermometer shows.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons here: the amount of precipitation is approximately the same all year round.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing people, nature is still wild, so you should not feed or disturb the animals.
The park administration warns: do not approach bears and wolves closer than 100 yards/meters, and all other wild animals closer than 25 yards/meters!
No matter how docile they look, bison, elk, bears, and virtually all large animals can be dangerous.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance. These animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so respect their personal space.
Also, remember that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid cooking or carrying smelly food, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The bay was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the US and Britain refused to leave the bay.
All the ships sank, with the exception of one British cruiser. About 200 American and German sailors died.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the killing of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches here, as Auckland is located on the shores of two harbors. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour area) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of these beaches are sandy with safe swimming, and many of them are shady thanks to trees such as the pohutukawa.
In the central area of Auckland, where the prestigious suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers are located in the Waitemata Bay, the Tamaki Drive beaches stretch out.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The most popular local beer is "Number One", it has a simple, pleasant and refreshing taste. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines that can be drunk, but New Zealand and Australian wines can be transported better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are still concerned, it is not difficult to find bottled water.
The idea of "flat white" is incomprehensible to Australians. "Small black" is an espresso, cappuccinos are served with a high layer of whipped cream (not foam), and tea without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Although fruit juices are expensive, they are of excellent quality.
A large number of trips are made to the reef throughout the year, and injuries caused by any of these reasons on the reef are rare.
Still, follow the recommendations of the authorities, obey all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Cubomedusae are found near beaches and river mouths north of 1770 from October to April, although they can sometimes be found outside of this period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
Estuarine crocodiles do not lead an active life in the ocean, and their main habitat is the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking allows the traveler not to worry about where to stay upon arrival at the destination.
Travel agents often make deals with specific hotels, but you can book through a travel agent and other forms of accommodation, such as camping sites.
Tour agents usually sell packages that include breakfast, transfer to/from the airport, or even combined packages that include flight and hotel accommodation.
In addition, they can hold the reservation if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for the destination (for example, a visa).
Any changes or requests should be sent to the travel agency first, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of attendees sleep right on the festival grounds, and most of them consider it an essential part of the program.
If you want to be close to the stage, you need to arrive early to find a camping spot close to the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages may have already ended, there may be areas at the festival where music will continue to play until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter, find out about the location of the cabin, as walking on the ice leads to a rather eerie noise, which can disturb the sleep of the most sensitive people.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include city tours. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Usually, casinos make every effort to ensure that visitors spend as much time and money as possible in the establishment. There are no windows or clocks, and it can be difficult to find the exits.
They usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and prevent them from leaving the establishment.
Some establishments offer free alcohol, but intoxication clouds the mind, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who is planning to travel through the high latitudes or mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or frost.
On an icy and snowy road, the friction is low, and you won't be able to drive the car the same way as on regular asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow to cause a blockage can fall in a very short period of time.
Visibility can also be restricted due to snowfall, blizzards, condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, weather conditions with snow and ice are normal in many countries, and traffic continues almost without interruption throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest draw for tourists in Africa and the main event for many travelers.
In everyday usage, the term "safari" means a land-based trip to see Africa's stunning wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, often approach cars, so you can get a good view even with regular equipment.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better through binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari" or "walking tour") consists of a hike lasting from several hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in different locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will become the only city in Asia to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice. They were first held here in 1964.
If you booked airline tickets and accommodation for 2020 before the date was postponed, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies may vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-related policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with the standard ticket price around 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes helps it dry. Many hotels rent out irons and ironing boards, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron handy or you're not keen on the idea of wearing ironed socks, you can try a hairdryer if you have one.
Do not expose the fabric to excessive heat (which may cause shrinkage or, in very rare cases, burns).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, it is enough to boil the water for a minute, in others it will take several minutes.
Filters are effective to varying degrees, and if in doubt, you should consider buying bottled water and from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that they have not seen in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, even worse, trigger allergic reactions, secrete poison or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases in themselves or dangerous animals that can cause injury or death to humans are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods at certain points without taxes and excise duties.
Travelers heading to high-tax countries can sometimes save a significant amount, especially on items like alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fermon has the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through isolated, hilly and wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be on your guard: steep slopes, narrow alleys, and sharp turns predominate.
The established speed limits are noticeably lower than on previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict compliance with them is even more important than anything else.
However, oddly enough, cell phone coverage here is much better than in many other parts of the route, such as in Pennsylvania's Wilds.
German baked goods are quite good. In Bavaria, they are quite plentiful and diverse and resemble the baked goods of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit-based baked goods are common, with apple-based baked goods available year-round, and cherries and plums appearing in the summer.
German baked goods often use almonds, walnuts, and other tree nuts. Often, popular cakes go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but filling baked goods, try what is called a pancake or a filled doughnut, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the liquid content, curry can be "dry" or "wet".
In the interior regions of Pakistan and Northern India, yogurt is actively used in curries. In Southern India and some regions on the coast of the subcontinent, coconut milk is usually used.
Indonesian cuisine, with 17,000 islands to choose from, is a general term used to describe the vast variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But without qualification, the term usually refers to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, which is now widely spread throughout the archipelago, includes a range of simply seasoned dishes. The Javanese people prefer such flavorings as peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet, hanging from both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with better stability, but there may be safety issues, as there is a risk of getting a foot caught.
If a horse has thrown its rider but their foot is caught in the stirrup, the running horse can drag them along. To minimize this risk, a number of precautions can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel, which have a smooth and fairly thin sole.
In addition, some saddles, especially English ones, are equipped with safety bars, thanks to which the leather seat falls off the saddle if it is pulled back by a falling rider.
The Coyahuma Valley is the main destination in Chile for mountaineering. It is known as the Yosemite of South America and has a large number of large granite walls and rocks.
At the top, you can enjoy stunning mountain scenery. Climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes in its huge potential for mountaineering.
Mountain winter sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending snowy terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is the main tourist destination for many ski enthusiasts (they are sometimes also called "ski bums"), who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old: rock paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BCE!
Skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened the first ski club in Australia.
Cross-country skiingThis activity is also called backcountry, skitouring or ski hiking.
This involves, but usually does not include, hiking to the top and then skiing down unprepared slopes, as skiing in tundra requires stiffer skis and boots.
Imagine that the ski route is a hiking route.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover somewhat longer distances than when walking, but you will only be able to develop such speed on cross-country skis in extremely rare cases, when you do not have a heavy backpack and there is a prepared ski track.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling through many countries would mean having to apply for visas and go through passport control multiple times.
But the Schengen zone functions in this regard as a single country.
While in this zone, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each of the Schengen countries separately, which will save you time and money, as well as avoid paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured items are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define items that are over 100 years old as antiques.
This concept has geographical variations, where the age limit in places like North America may be lower than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be defined as antiques, despite the fact that they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important source of livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding this activity is also important for many other professions.
Although this is the tradition, not all members of the Saami people were engaged in mass breeding of reindeer; they lived by fishing, hunting and other similar occupations, using reindeer mainly as pack animals.
Today, many Sami are employed in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sami region of Lapland.
Although the word "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Roma, it is often considered offensive because of the associations with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Roma people.
If there are travel advisories warning against travel to the country you are visiting, this may affect your travel insurance or trip cancellation insurance.
You may also want to consult with other governments besides your own, but their advice is directed at their own citizens.
Here's one example: U.S. citizens in the Middle East can face situations that Europeans or Arabs cannot.
In the news reports, the political situation in one country is only briefly described.
The opinions expressed are often superficial, vague and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information widely available.
Adverse meteorological conditions are a general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, cause serious social upheaval, or result in human casualties.
Adverse weather conditions occur all over the world, and they come in various forms that depend on geography, terrain, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall and forest fires are manifestations and effects of severe weather phenomena such as storms, tornadoes, water spouts and hurricanes.
Regional and seasonal hazardous weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to take into account any risks associated with severe weather in their area, as it may affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
A search on the internet for the phrase "safety course in a hostile environment" may yield the address of a local company.
In the course, all the topics covered here are usually discussed in much more detail, most often with hands-on training.
The course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes the playing out of situations, a large amount of information on first aid, and sometimes training with weapons.
Books and magazines that talk about survival in the wilderness are common, but publications about combat zones are few and far between.
People planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should make sure they have valid documents for the return journey.
The readiness of governments to issue passports without specifying gender (X) or documents updated to reflect the desired name and gender varies from place to place.
The willingness of foreign governments to fulfill their obligations under these documents is just as varied.
Searches at checkpoints also became much more thorough after the events of September 11, 2001.
Transgender people preparing for surgery should not have to expect to be able to pass through scanners without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
A rip current is a current created by waves breaking on the shore, or sometimes on a reef or something similar.
The return flow is concentrated in several deeper areas, where a rapid current can form, going to great depths, due to a similar underwater topography.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion while attempting to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you are out of the current, swimming back will be no harder than usual.
Try to go somewhere where you won't be caught again, or depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, you might want to wait for rescue.
The shock of returning to one's home country comes earlier than the culture shock (here there is a shorter romantic period), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapt to a new culture sometimes find it especially difficult to readjust to their own culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you are adapted to the new culture and have lost some of the habits of your native culture.
When you first went abroad, people were likely to be patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adapt to a new country.
It may come as a surprise to people that patience and understanding are also needed for travellers returning home.
The sound and light show against the backdrop of the pyramid is one of the most interesting events in the area for children.
The pyramids can be seen in the dark, and you can also see them in silence before the start of the show.
Usually there is always noise from tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is like a book with stories.
The Sphinx acts as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes show pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
Several countries claim the South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819. There are more bases on these islands than anywhere else, and sixteen of them were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers from the peninsula. The largest island is named after King George, with the settlement of Villa las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston and Desolation Islands, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano to this day represents an impressive natural harbor.
The Ellsworth Land is an area south of the Antarctic Peninsula, washed by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of this peninsula here merge with the plateau, and then rise again and form the 360-kilometer-long Elsworth mountain system, divided into two parts by the Minnesota glacier.
In the northern part, that is, on the Sentinel Range, the highest mountains in Antarctica are located — the Vinson massif, the highest point of which reaches 4892 m and is called Vinson Peak.
In remote locations outside of cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Typically, a satellite phone is not a replacement for a cell phone, as you need to be outside in direct line of sight with the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used in shipping, including pleasure and high-speed vessels, where there is a need for remote data transmission and voice communication.
You should generally be able to get more information about connecting this service by contacting your local phone company.
A growing option for those planning to take a gap year is to travel and study.
This is particularly popular among school leavers, allowing them to take a year off before going to university without compromising their education.
In many cases, taking a course abroad during your academic break can actually increase your chances of being accepted into a higher education institution in your home country.
As a rule, tuition fees are charged for admission to such educational programs.
Finland is an excellent place for boating tourism. In the "land of a thousand lakes," there are also thousands of islands on the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
When exploring archipelagos or visiting lakes, you can easily do without a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes can indeed accommodate any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak leave a completely different impression.
Boating is a national form of leisure in Finland. In particular, there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
The situation is similar in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in other cases it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands this value ranges from one to forty).
Most individual Baltic cruises include an extended stay in Russia's St. Petersburg.
This means that you can spend several full days in this historic city, and then return to the ship to sleep.
If you go ashore only as part of a ship excursion, you won't need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures feature Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be frightening for people of all ages and social statuses, especially if it is their first flight or if they have had a traumatic experience in the past.
There is no need to be ashamed of this: it is no different from personal dislike and fear of other things that many people have.
Understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome the fear that arises from the unknown or the inability to control the process.
Delivery services are well paid for fast delivery. Often, the speed of delivery of commercial documentation, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs is very important.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, this was a problem.
If they were to send anything as air cargo, then on some routes unloading and customs clearance could take several days.
The only way to deal with it faster is to send it as registered luggage. The airline's regulations do not allow for luggage to be sent without a passenger, so your involvement is needed here.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to shell out for the privilege (or, better still, get your company to pay for you).
However, it is not cheap at all - based on experience, you will pay roughly four times more for business class than for economy class, and eleven times more for first class!
As a rule, it doesn’t even make sense to look for discounts on business class or first class for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know full well that there is a core group of passengers who are willing to pay a pretty penny for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, which is why they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has fallen victim to an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between these two parts of Moldova were restored.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is Turkey's third-largest city with a population of around 3.7 million, the largest port after Istanbul, and an excellent transport hub.
Once an ancient city, Smyrna today is a modern, developed and bustling commercial center, located along a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades, modern shopping centers alternate with places with traditional roofs with red tiles, an 18th-century market, old mosques and churches, although the city has more of an atmosphere of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
From the village of Halldorsvik, you can see the nearby island of Esturoy, and it is also home to an unusual octagonal church.
In the church cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves on some graves.
It is worth taking half an hour to walk around the unusual village.
Not far away, to the north, is the romantic and charming town of Sintra, celebrated by Lord Byron and subsequently famous throughout the world.
The Scotturb bus number 403 makes regular trips to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
To the north, you should also visit the great Temple of Our Lady of Fatima (mausoleum) – the site of the world-famous apparitions of the Virgin Mary.
Please remember that you are, in principle, in a place of a mass grave, as well as a place that is incredibly important for a significant percentage of the inhabitants of the globe.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, but there are even more people whose loved ones were killed here or worked to death here, whether they were Jews or people of other nationalities.
Please treat this place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust and the Nazis.
Do not desecrate this place by painting or scratching graffiti on the objects around it.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, most understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as it is the first official language by law.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other public places.
The usual announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known to be self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although it is often just a false stereotype, the best way to succeed in Paris is to behave in the best possible way, like a "bien élevé" (well-bred) person. This will greatly facilitate adaptation in this city.
The unfriendly appearance of Parisians will immediately disappear if you show a little basic politeness.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce and pine trees, and represents a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to the combination of microclimates, different soils and altitude differences, it is home to a particularly wide variety of plant communities.
The area is teeming with a huge number of different species of animals and birds.
Here you can meet rare representatives of the fauna, for example, the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and grouse, as well as many other common species of animals.
When visiting monasteries, women must be dressed in skirts below the knee and with covered shoulders.
In most monasteries they give clothing to women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one of bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men should wear trousers that cover their knees.
You can also get them at the entrance, but this clothing is not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable in these skirts. One size fits all men!
The cuisine of Majorca, as well as the cuisines of similar regions of the Mediterranean, is based on vegetables, bread and meat (especially pork), with the widespread use of olive oil.
A simple and popular lunch dish, especially in the summer, is Pa-amb-oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available fillings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word Sie, which means You, are always written with a capital letter even in the middle of a sentence.
It is important to distinguish between verbs and complements.
This also probably simplifies reading, while writing is somewhat complicated by the need to determine whether a verb or adjective is used in the substantivized form.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively simple, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
One should be especially careful with the letters c and g, as their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel.
Don't forget that r and rr are pronounced differently: caro means "expensive", while carro means "cart".
The Persian language has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this textbook on Persian grammar will help you learn a lot of new things and better understand expressions.
It is obvious that if you know a language from the Romance subgroup, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish may hastily conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it doesn't need to be learned separately.
Ancient observatories are generally considered outdated today and serve as museums or educational institutions.
Because light pollution wasn't as much of a problem during their heyday, they're usually located in cities or campuses that are easier to get to than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge structures located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, called "hanami", has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This idea came from China, where the favorite flower was the color of a plum.
In Japan, the first celebrations of the cherry blossom were organized by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural habitat, so resist the temptation to take even one specimen.
When visiting an officially organized garden, collecting "samples" will also result in you being kicked out without any discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to be, easy to navigate, and almost everything can be bought after arrival.
But, being in the "deep tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with both heat (constantly) and strong sun (on a clear day, less often).
There are also several buses going north to Hebron, a legendary burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, as well as their wives.
Make sure the bus you are about to board is going to Hebron, not just the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme for any holiday.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, taking a cruise along the Danube, or traveling by boat along the Erie Canal.
They also determine the routes for popular walking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with this holiday have also been adopted by non-Christians in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night without going to bed, in some open place, to see the sunrise.
Of course, this tradition has a Christian theological explanation, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold Easter services on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with parishioners usually starting the celebration of Christ's Resurrection at midnight.
All the animals that originally arrived on these islands got here by swimming, flying or being washed up by the current.
Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals could not get there, which makes the giant tortoise the main herbivorous animal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since the arrival of humans to the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctica in the winter, you will experience polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This presents a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, because the sky will be more or less dark all day long.
Since these areas are sparsely populated, and as a result, light pollution is often not an issue, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what people in the West are used to.
Costumes are standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by their last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is extremely important, and the results of group work are valued higher than individual achievements.
Normally, workers must obtain permission from the boss before making any decisions and are obliged to unquestioningly carry out the boss's orders.
