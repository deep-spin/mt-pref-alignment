Despite the fact that an experimental vaccine has been found that can reduce mortality from the Ebola virus, no medication has yet demonstrated a clear effect in treating the existing infection.
The antibody cocktail ZMapp initially showed promising results in this area, but official studies have shown it to be less effective in preventing death than previously expected.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control, meaning researchers used it as a baseline and compared it to three other treatments.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely accepted theory, but also provides details that cannot usually be obtained from fossil remains, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were above a chestnut-brown color, and below - either pale or with carotenoid pigmentation.
The find also allows us to learn about the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the feathers of dinosaurs lack a well-developed shaft called a rachis, but still have other distinguishing features - beards and whiskers - researchers concluded that the rachis most likely appeared later through the evolutionary development of other distinguishing features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for regulating temperature and display. The researchers assumed that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample represents adult plumage, not the down of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, despite the fact that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, this specimen has the plumage of an adult, not a chick's down.

They found that the Sun operates according to the same basic principles as other stars: it was established that the activity of all stars in the system is determined by their brightness, rotation, and nothing else.
The combination of luminosity and rotation is used to determine the number of Rossby waves in the star associated with the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to magnetic field inversions.

The work done was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the galaxy in Sagittarius.
The effect the team was looking for could be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon attracts the Earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way affects the galaxy in Sagittarius.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way as it does with regular matter.
According to this theory, a significant portion of the dark matter around the Galaxy is located in the form of a halo and consists of a large number of small particles.

During research in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa, Dr Tony Moll managed to discover tuberculosis with exceptionally high resistance to drugs (XDR-TB).
In an interview, he said that the new strain "raises very big concerns, as it leads to a very high mortality rate".
Some patients may have been infected in the hospital, Dr. Moll thinks, and at least two were health care workers at the hospital.
In one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 people through close contact.
However, the percentage of people with multi-drug resistant TB in the overall TB population still seems low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 infected at any given time in South Africa.

According to the data from the infrared images, the differences in night and day temperatures suggest that these are most likely caves.
During the day they are colder than the surrounding surface, and at night they are warmer.
Their thermal characteristics are not as stable as those of larger caves on Earth, which often maintain almost constant temperatures, but they are consistent with those of deep pits in the ground, said Glen Cushing, of the Department of Planetary Geology at the U.S. Geological Survey and the University of Northern Arizona, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally conducted using low-tech methods: the voter closes themselves in a booth and puts a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, they drop the envelope into the ballot box and sign the voter list.
French laws on elections are quite strict in terms of procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can ensure that there are no envelopes inside at the start of the vote and that no other envelopes have been added, except those of those people who have been allowed to vote and whose votes have been counted properly.
Candidates can send their representatives to monitor the entire process, and in the evening the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision according to a special procedure.

The Uki gun malfunctioned when it was aimed at the head of the fifth man. Schneider is in constant pain, he is blind in one eye, he has a missing part of his skull, and his face has been reconstructed using titanium.
Schneider testified via video link from a US Air Force base in his home country.
In addition to Wednesday's competition, Carpendale took part in two individual competitions at the championships.
Her first competition was a slalom, in the first run of which she did not make it to the finish line. 36 out of 116 participants had the same result in that race.
In another race, this time in the giant slalom, she finished tenth among women in the sitting position with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place Austrian Claudia Lesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place Hungarian Diengi Dani.
Four skiers in the women's sitting group were unable to complete their runs, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to finish the race.
The police of the state of Madhya Pradesh returned the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and returned her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused have the names Baba Kandjar, Bhuta Kandjar, Rampro Kandjar and Vishnu Kandjar.
Police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused were presented before the judges with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the building at the time the car crashed into it, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Subsequently, the Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged Adekoye with the murder of her son.
She is in custody pending charges and trial, but any testimony could be tainted because her celebrity has been widely exploited by the media.
This is standard practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish law works differently and the courts found the publication of the photographs to be potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to be truly walking on the edge by publishing photos and other data about suspects".
The Royal Prosecutor's Office, which is generally responsible for prosecution, told reporters that no further comments would be made, at least until a verdict is handed down.
The document, according to the leaked information, will concern a dispute over the borders that Palestine wants to establish based on those that existed before the start of the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other topics reportedly discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both peoples, and the issue of the Jordan River valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PNA agrees to the maintenance of such a presence for only five years.
The deer that participated in the additional test for pest control had to be under the close supervision of rangers, since the test was being monitored and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
As part of the partnership between NPWS and the New South Wales (NSW) Sporting Shooters Association, qualified volunteers were recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flaherty, acting director of conservation and heritage for the National Park Service, the four shooters selected for the first firing operation underwent comprehensive training and safety briefings.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new Interim Electoral Council (CEI), consisting of nine members.
This is the fifth CEP Marty has received in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the previous interim electoral council resign as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Marthelli's response to the mass protests against the government that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were caused by the failure to hold elections, some of which were supposed to have taken place as early as 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of defective iPod devices have been reported, resulting in six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 cases related to these devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Labor and Industry announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company described as "not serious."
In response, the ministry called Apple's delay in reporting the issue "very regrettable."
At 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday) an earthquake occurred in Mariana.
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office stated that there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer hijacked a tourist bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and took Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired shots from his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers took the place of an elderly woman, as she had gone to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Lygins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and gynaecologist and started working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, in his free time, Liggins began investigating cases of premature birth.
His research showed that if the hormone is introduced, it will accelerate the maturation of the child's lungs during fetal development.
Xinhua reports that on Wednesday, government investigators discovered two flight recorders, or "black boxes".
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to the Moon.
Here's what Tommy Dreamer said: "The Moon was the first Queen of Extreme. She was my first manager. The Moon passed away on the night of two moons. It's already a unique event, just like she was. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said: "The Moon was as infected as I am... Maybe even more infected... I love her and I'll miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed ahead of the 2010 federal election, the number who oppose Australia becoming a republic has grown by 8 per cent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard during the 2010 federal election campaign expressed the view that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34% of those surveyed share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
The survey showed the following: 29 percent of respondents are sure that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that it does not need this form of government.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games but his fitness is now in doubt following his complaints.
He was unable to take painkillers, which are banned in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date on January 25.
On Tuesday it was announced that by the beginning of February several people had confirmed this discovery using various hardware and software.
Comets may have been a source of water delivery to Earth, as well as a source of organic compounds that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth was formed, as comets have been colliding with the Earth for a very long time.
The 53-year-old Cuomo took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called these rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
It is assumed that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, will allow planes to fly on shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology instead of the old ground-based radar technology, which will allow air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the position of aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport has been sent to Wembley, there will be no stopping of land trains, and there are no parking lots or lay-bys on the surface.
Concerns over a lack of transportation have led to speculation that the game may have to be played behind closed doors without fans.
The description of the study, published on Thursday in the journal Science, talks about the emergence of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden) reported that due to mating between the endemic Darwin's finch (Geospiza fortes) and the transplanted cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris), a new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process would take much longer.
Gold can be given any shape. It can be cast into very small forms.
It can be drawn into thin wire, which can be twisted and plated. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It could be made very thin and attached to another metal. It could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books - the so-called "illuminated manuscript".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH value is determined by the degree of saturation with hydrogen ions (H in pH) of the chemical compound being examined.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Get a new mixture by mixing the two dry powders in one container, and then form a ball with your clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the top layer, which will be unusual, and then a kind of shell will form.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet connected to a complex sewage system.
Remnants of the sewage systems have been found in the houses of Minoan cities on the islands of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women bathed together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and almost instantly reflects it back down.
The satellite was delivered into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere somewhat distorts our light and view.
A giant rocket more than 100 feet tall is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed our world in an incredible way. The most important thing the wheel has done for us is to give us much easier and faster transportation.
It gave us the train, the car and many other vehicles.
Beneath them are larger cats that eat prey ranging in size from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
And finally, many small cats (including domestic house cats) eat and hunt much smaller animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in the concept of a niche, the special work that each type of cat performs, which keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
The pride consists of one to three adult males that are related, as well as females and cubs, the number of which can reach thirty.
Females are usually related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave very similarly to packs of wolves or dogs - animals that, in their behavior, are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) and are also very dangerous to their prey.
As a fully developed athlete, a tiger can climb trees (although not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with the strength of five strong men.
Tigers belong to the same family (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that have the ability to roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like the barking of sentences made up of indistinct words.
Cheetahs love to eat small animals. If the opportunity arises, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that a cheetah hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow the trail of animals and find prey by smell, tracking its movements on the ground with their sense of smell.
They are able to see perfectly in the dark with the help of night vision and move almost imperceptibly. Ocelots track their prey by blending in with their surroundings, and then pounce on their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population it came from (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or changes compared to what it had before to become a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed at all - it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to a new environment, it begins to look less and less like the rest of the population.
Over time, after thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that it will be impossible to say that they are the same species.
We call this process speciation, the origin of new species, and it is a necessary consequence and a crucial part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants feed on the sun through photosynthesis, and they also cast shadows.
We build our homes and make clothes from plants. Most of our food comes from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the most fearsome predator of its time, so it feared no one except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were lined with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, and it had an additional row on its throat, so that there was no escape for those who crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that his tongue was forked. He fed on turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and may have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that went into the water; even a giant dinosaur like a tyrannosaur would not have been a match for it.
Despite the fact that much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans still had their strange and unusual dishes served during feasts, such as wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a coney.
There was another difference: while poor people and women ate while sitting on chairs, the rich liked to have joint feasts during which they ate while lying on their sides.
The diet of ancient Romans could not have included products that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in the following centuries.
In particular, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and not a single ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of the gods, which was considered the god's home.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the desires of the gods in ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which could only be entered by priests.
Sometimes special towers in the form of pyramids called "zikkurats" were built as elements of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house was not particularly important.
Most of the Jewish family's life took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; the shops had open counters that faced the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Scandinavian sagas tell us that Erik the Red was expelled from Iceland for murder, and, moving further west, he discovered Greenland and gave it its name.
But regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each of the countries was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the peoples, rulers, traditions, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you saw the movie "National Treasure," you might think that the Declaration of Independence was printed on the reverse side with a map of treasures.
However, this is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence reads: "The Declaration of Independence was signed on the 4th of July 1776." The text is written at the bottom of the document and upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence, this large parchment document (29¾ by 24½ inches) was folded for easier storage.
Thus, it is quite possible that the recording was added simply as a note.
As a result of Operation Neptune and subsequent battles, the north of France was liberated, but the south was not yet liberated.
It was run by "Vichy" French, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of opposing them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the southern part of France. The invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just 2 weeks, the forces of Free France and the Americans liberated southern France and headed towards Germany.
Civilization is a separate culture, the bearers of which are a fairly large group of people who live and work together, society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin civilis, which means "civil" and is related to the Latin words civis, meaning "citizen", and civitas, meaning "city" or "city-state", and it also expresses the size of society in a certain way.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. Civilizational culture implies the transfer of knowledge across several generations, an uninterrupted cultural presence, and a sustainable spread.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving corresponding historical evidence, and therefore cannot be recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the American War of Independence, thirteen states, in accordance with the Articles of Confederation, formed a weak central government, the only body of which was the Congress.
The Congress had no authority to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the states, which often refused to cooperate and refused to enforce its acts.
He also did not have the authority to repeal state tax laws and tariffs.
To pass amendments, according to the articles, requires the unanimous approval of all states, but the states have been so unresponsive to the central government that their representatives have often been absent.
The Italian football team, along with the German team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions. Residents of these regions of Italy participate in international competitions and the Olympics.
In Japan, there are approximately 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to its belonging to a cluster/group of islands, Japan is often referred to from a geographical point of view as an archipelago.
Taiwan has its origins many years ago, in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of the indigenous methods of grain production and hiring Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which it ceded the rights to Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a more accurate idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored. Restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for static photographs in the world is 35 mm, and this size was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue era.
Today it is still produced, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by the image sizes of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually somewhat confusing, it has a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get a ratio with small whole numbers) is therefore accepted as 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS family) are equal to or close to these proportions.
The rule of thirds, too often used and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a certain degree of order in the image.
It states that it is best to place the main object at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, came under close scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity united European states despite differences in languages and traditions.
Its pervasive power touched everyone, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds exist precisely for this purpose.
The center of ecclesiastical power was based in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether this dogma was being observed.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This strategy proved effective by cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated universally accepted international laws laid out in several international agreements over the past two hundred years.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sectors of the oceans, endangering even neutral vessels.
As the response to this tactic was restrained, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, among the majority of citizens and peoples, sentiments such as pacifism and isolation prevailed.
Having experienced the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, states wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America and accepted an offer to work for the Edison company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, who had been his boss at his previous job, to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, a unique way of designating periods of time was used; each stage of China or each family that held power was a special dynasty.
In addition, during the reigns of each dynasty, there was fragmentation and instability. The most famous era was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years during the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, there were fierce military actions between many noble people fighting for the throne.
The Age of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in battles over the throne in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many such social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people rather than a single ruler.
After the Revolution, opportunities for work also opened up for all men, which allowed the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same applies to the army, because ranks are based on qualities, not on origin.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in topics unrelated to worldly life. He often visited a cave, which became known as "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (light) for contemplation.
Well, the cave, which has survived to this day, gives us a very vivid idea of Muhammad's spiritual aspirations.
The cave is located on the top of a mountain to the north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It is very difficult to find, even for someone who knows it exists. In the cave, a person is completely isolated.
There is nothing to see except for the pure beauty of the sky above and the many surrounding mountains. From the depths of the cave, one can only see and hear a very small part of this world.
The Great Pyramid in Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC and is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor the pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the Giza Necropolis, in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and relatives.
The upward hook sign looks like a V, and the downward hook sign looks like a bracket or a square with no bottom.
"Up" means you should start from the tip and draw the bow forward, and "down" means you should start from where your hand holds the bow and draw it back.
The movement of the bow up usually produces a softer sound, while the movement of the bow down is stronger and more forceful.
You can draw your own stroke, but remember that the stroke is printed for musical reasons and it is usually worth following it.
On October 6, 1789, an angry crowd of women from the market forced King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles in terror.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted threats at the king and queen.
A crowd of people forced the King and Queen to open the windows wide.
At one point, one member of the crowd gestured to the head of the Royal Guardsman killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The military expenses of American imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the expenses and interest on bond loans moved on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking offices.
Of course, the superprofits brought in by the long exploitation of the Filipinos constituted the main income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era in which these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history that spans the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 CE).
The High Middle Ages succeeded the earlier Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, which, according to the accepted view, ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of practical ideas, from technological progress or the technological imperative to the strict view that the fundamental logic of human destiny is linked to the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
Most views of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the direction of technological development is largely impervious to cultural or political influence, and that, in turn, the "impact" of technology on society is determined by its own properties, rather than by society.
For example, one could argue that the automobile is a necessary cause of the development of roads.
However, the nationwide road network is economically unprofitable for only a small group of vehicles, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increase in the number of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new methods of treating injuries in healthcare.
Romanticism largely included cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time, customs and culture associated with it emerged, which, being in harmony with the place of residence of that society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is called the capital of fashion in the modern world, Constantinople was considered the capital of fashion during the feudal era in Europe.
Glory as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined throughout the twelfth century mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were more highly valued than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
It was at this point that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West can be 25-30 years behind.
Own styles began to develop in Western Europe by the end of the Middle Ages. One of the greatest achievements of that time, thanks to the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture practiced to produce enough food to meet the needs of only the farmer and his/her family.
Natural farming is a simple, often organic, system of agriculture that uses the seeds of plants that grow in a given ecosystem, along with crop rotation and other relatively simple methods of increasing crop yields.
Historically, most farmers have engaged in agriculture for subsistence, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel oppressed by society's standards, and allow such people to define themselves.
There may be differences between subcultures based on age, nationality, social status, place of residence, and/or gender of the people that make up the subculture.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a particular subculture often declare their affiliation through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to illustrate several unfortunate cases where children, due to a lack of attention, unfortunate circumstances, or intentional abuse, did not have contact with adults during their upbringing.
Such children are called "feral" or "wild". Some feral children were isolated by humans (usually their own parents). In some cases, such rejection of their child was the result of parents' non-acceptance of their child's serious intellectual or physical disability.
Children living on the streets may have experienced severe forms of violence or trauma before running away or being abandoned.
Others, it is claimed, were raised by animals; some of them lived in the wild on their own.
If he is fully raised by animals instead of people, a feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limitations) that are almost identical to those of the specific animal that raised him or her—for example, a fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should be simpler and more engaging, scaffolding beats many technologies.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather a form of assistance to those going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Skaufolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of skaufolding, but so is Scribble in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding, which helps with learning, is built into the software and is designed to remind, explain and ask questions about procedures that the learner may find too difficult to handle on their own.
Children are handed over to care for a multitude of reasons: from homelessness to abuse and even extortion.
Children should not have to grow up in an environment where education, care, and upbringing are not provided, but they do.
We believe the foster care system is safe for children.
Our foster care system should provide safe housing, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care should provide for all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique features of the Internet lead to additional scope in terms of approach to use and satisfaction.
Thus, the idea that "learning" and "socialization" are important motivating factors for using the internet (James et al., 1995) is expressed.
"Personal involvement" and "long-term contact" were also named by Ajrami and McCorved (1998) as new dimensions of motivation when they studied how people respond to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the field of interpreting microexpressions—facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to determine whether a person is lying by means of a proper interpretation of their microexpressions.
In the article "The President's Speech," Oliver Sachs described how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage can nevertheless correctly assess the sincerity of the speaker.
According to his assumption, animals, such as domestic dogs, may possess similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
Studies conducted in the twentieth century showed that there are two types of genetic variability: hidden and expressed.
A mutation introduces a new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the set of manifest variations.
Segregation and recombination with each generation shuffle the variations between the two pools.
In the savannah, primates with a digestive system like humans find it difficult to meet their amino acid needs from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so will result in serious consequences such as stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but they are poorly digested by primates like us if not cooked.
On the contrary, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also a rich source of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
Taking all of the above into account, it is not surprising that our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in much the same way as chimpanzees in the savannah do to this day.
Interrupted sleep is a process of deliberate waking up during normal sleep and falling asleep again after a short time (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily done with a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you out of sleep without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm in your sleep, then you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options that are based on biological rhythms include drinking large amounts of liquid (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which causes the person to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the voltage, the more positive the life force within you is. Every person is potentially given the ability to find absolute peace and a sense of fulfillment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment, the only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negative attitude.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been supplemented with the Mahayana path of love and a variety of techniques from Indian yoga.
The principle of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple: it consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-consuming love.
The energy of kundalini (the energy of enlightenment) in kundalini yoga is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The heart of Tibetan meditation is Yoga of the Gods. Through visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and enlightenment of consciousness is achieved.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the US. After the war ended, disagreements regarding the system, process, and culture led to a rift between the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last the next 40 years, with real wars fought through proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places around the world.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been breached, and the only hope was retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became irrelevant almost overnight, when about 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after seizing the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is certainly the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The job of sailors has traditionally been to ensure a country's ability to move its people and goods, while simultaneously preventing an enemy from moving their people and goods.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples of this was the company in the North Atlantic during World War II, when the Americans tried to transport people and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mostly its submarines, tried to stop this movement.
If the anti-Hitler coalition had failed, Germany would most likely have been able to conquer Britain, just as it had conquered the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, which were often watched over by goat herders, who were often children or teenagers, much like the more common practice of a shepherd. These grazing methods are still used today.
Cart tracks were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the packhorse roads were little more than parallel rows of wooden planks, they allowed horses to carry larger loads at a faster speed than the slightly more rutted roads of the time.
Tie rods were first used a long time ago to keep the rails in place, but it later became clear that tracks were more effective with a layer of iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Over time, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron appeared.
The first known form of transportation was walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (which means upright man).
For their Australopithecus ancestors, bipedalism was not so common.
Bipedal specializations are found in the remains of Australopithecus from the period of 4.2–3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally conscious lives, we can become members of environmental movements and even activists to alleviate the suffering to some extent.
Typically, this is like treating the symptoms. If we need more than a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and address it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed dramatically under the influence of the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and due to overpopulation and people's extravagant lifestyles, the problems have become more widespread.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4, the handwritten draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
150-200 copies were made overnight, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of this document was done by John Nicholson in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8.
On July 6, one copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered it to be read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 known Danlap leaflets are the oldest surviving copies of the document; the original handwritten copy has not survived.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and made it to the present day. We call them birds.
They are often not considered dinosaurs because they have feathers and are capable of flight.
But there is still much to be said about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have paws with spikes and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on processing information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, that is, 0 or 1. These numbers are called "binary digits" or "bits" when using computer jargon.
It can be difficult to immediately identify oral poisoning, as symptoms such as vomiting are too general for a quick diagnosis.
The best sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicine or toxic household chemical.
Check the label for specific instructions on first aid in case of poisoning with this particular poison.
The term "beetle" is used by entomologists formally to refer to a group of insects.
This concept comes from the well-known bed bugs, insects that have been around since ancient times and are well adapted to parasitizing on humans.
Both predators and bed bugs are nesting species adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
Approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) have been detected in the United States, making MS the leading neurological disease in young people and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that twice as many women as men suffer from multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their child.
When adopting or fostering, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main goal of science is to figure out how the world is structured by applying the scientific method. This method is actually the basis of most scientific research.
It is not, however, the only one. Scientific research is also guided by experimentation (an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses), asking questions, and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused their attention on ancient texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
In all scientific matters, including psychology, the views of Aristotle were adopted.
As knowledge of the Greek language deteriorated, the West found itself cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often heavily dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their generation by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, not simply a response to external periodic stimuli, have been recorded in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue autonomous cyclicity over a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the first assumptions that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase implanted their DNA into a bacterium using phages, i.e. viruses.
They conducted two experiments, labeling the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus and the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can cause a wide variety of outcomes, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected stretch of genetic material, and whether the mutated cells are embryonic stem cells.
Only mutations in the embryonic lineage cells can be passed on to the children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is interesting for those who like to go to nature to enjoy the landscape, including wild animals and plants.
Among the examples of active recreation at the site are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small towns in the countryside to go to their workplaces, while those whose workplaces are in the place they have just left drive past them.
In this active transportation movement, everyone is connected to and supports the personal vehicle-based transportation system in one way or another.
Currently, science indicates that the vast hydrocarbon economy has affected one of the stable states of the biosphere, which has supported the evolution of humanity over the past two million years.
Everyone is a member of society and uses transportation systems. Virtually everyone complains about these systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about the quality of water or collapsing bridges.
Why are there so many complaints about transportation systems, why do they break down every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent, or are there more fundamental reasons for this?
The study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other is carried out as part of the study of transport flows.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the intensity of traffic because it is impossible to predict the behavior of drivers with 100% probability.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers is often quite systematic; thus, transportation flows as a whole have some systematicity and can be approximately described mathematically.
To better represent the transport flow, relationships were established between three main variables: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of railway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them to escape enemies more easily, find food and partners.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their body, which gives them an advantage.
This provides them with more hiding places from predators.
Dragonflies and damselflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Many believed him to be right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system rotates around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems like a reasonable idea because we don't feel that the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world, carrying more than 8 times the amount of water compared to the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with a width that sometimes reaches six miles.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers of our planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon has a length of 6,387 km (3,980 miles). Thousands of small rivers flow into it.
Despite the fact that the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical sophistication of the pyramids in Giza were never surpassed.
In the new kingdom of the ancient Egyptians, they admired the monuments created by their predecessors more than a thousand years ago.
The Vatican's population is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, as well as the country with the smallest population.
Italian is used in legislation and official communications in the Vatican.
Italian is also the everyday language for most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have been aware of the basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, as they can all be found in nature in their pure form and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
They were like four states of matter (in that order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also suggested they transitioned into a new state to make what we see.
Alloys, in essence, are a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
It is also possible to make alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them can fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil became a good friend for many people when it first appeared.
It's sad that when new writing methods appeared, the pencil lost its former status and people started using it less.
Now people type messages on computer screens and never have to deal with a typewriter.
It is impossible to say what will happen to the keyboard with the advent of newer technologies.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that in order for a large number of protons and neutrons to be in the same nucleus, energy is required.
It's a bit like rolling a heavy cart up a hill, and then the re-splitting of the nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means they tend to decay with little or no provocation.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km under the oceans and 100 km under the continents.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more lunar seas on the visible side because the crust is thinner there, making it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what makes people act or what can interest them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that accumulate inside them as they grow up.
These theories address what drives specific people to want to do what they do, and what their environment causes them to do or not do.
Two popular theories about content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory of Motivation.
As a rule, two types of behavior can be observed when managers begin to manage people who were previously their equals in status. One extreme of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or "one of the girls").
It is difficult for such managers to make unpopular decisions, take disciplinary measures, evaluate the results of work, distribute responsibilities, and hold employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that they must change everything the team has done and take credit for it.
After all, the manager is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This kind of behavior often leads to conflicts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are some differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They are usually more autonomous than employees from traditional teams, since their teams may meet according to different time zones, which local management may not always understand.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is a team of managers, to whom each participant reports. The invisible team sets standards for each participant.
Why would an organization go through the laborious process of creating a self-learning organization? One of the goals of applying the concepts of self-learning organizations in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used in all functional units of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the organization's concerted efforts to overcome the obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that will meet the client's interests.
Before an organization can become innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and experience accumulation.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of effectiveness.
The data of neuroscience provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of consciousness, thus narrowing the field of research and making it much more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is used by scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen structures and processes in the brain.
This provides us with a large amount of data and materials for creating simulation models that help us understand the processes occurring in our consciousness.
Despite the fact that AI is firmly associated with science fiction, it forms a very important area of computer science, which deals with the behavior and training of machines and the "imparting" of intelligence to them.
Research in the field of AI involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Here are some examples that can be cited: control, planning and scheduling, reaction to diagnoses and client questions, as well as face, handwriting and voice recognition.
Such questions have been singled out into separate disciplines, the goal of which is to solve the problems we face in everyday life.
Currently, AI systems are often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, being embedded in some software applications for home computers and video games.
Educational excursions are very important for any class. Very often, teachers want to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The technology offers a solution through virtual tours, allowing students to examine museum exhibits, visit an aquarium or enjoy fine art while sitting with their class.
Posting a tour in a virtual space for all to see is also a great way to refresh your memory of the tour and share your newfound knowledge with future classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennett High School in North Carolina create a website about their visit to the state capital, and every year this website is updated, but access to the old versions is still preserved - they serve as a memory album.
Blogs can also improve students' writing skills. Although students often start their blog using shoddy grammar and spelling, this usually changes due to the presence of an audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to strive for improvement in their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Also, by blogging, "students begin to better understand the world around them". Students are inspired to be smart and interesting by engaging the attention of readers (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a collaborative tool that motivates students to extend the learning process far beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can enable students to become more analytical and critical. By actively responding to online materials, students can define their position in the context of other people's work, as well as express their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a delightful bilingual capital of Canada with a huge number of art galleries and museums that reveal Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, while the north is home to the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and the surrounding areas.
All of this and much more makes Ontario something truly Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and some of them are practically uninhabited.
A surprising comparison of population numbers: there are more African Americans in the US than citizens in Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is much larger than the others and is a unique continent in terms of wildlife.
Almost all the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region, especially to the Comoros and Mayotte.
The spread of European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened a route through the Cape of Good Hope from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahara, and in the south and west, by the Atlantic Ocean.
For women: all tourists are advised to say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that due to cultural differences, they may feel like they are being harassed, followed, touched, etc.
Firmly refuse men and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (this is unacceptable regardless of cultural differences!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE. It was used by the Romans, Phoenicians, and Merinids as a strategic port, called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Caza-Branca, but abandoned it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt a city called Ed-Dar-el-Beyda, and the Spanish traders who established trading posts here called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
It is easy to find places around the old medina where traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of trinkets are sold, but all of this is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, on the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the central part of the city.
Although Goma is a fairly safe place, you should obtain information in advance about any trips outside of Goma to understand the state of the fighting taking place in the North Kivu province.
This city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, and you can also see mountain gorillas in the wild here at one of the cheapest prices in Africa.
You can get around Goma by bodaboda (mototaxi). The usual (local) price is 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu became a metaphor for an exotic far-off land.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation attracts tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites under threat due to the danger posed by desert sands.
During the filming of Henry Louis Gates's program "The African Americans: Many Rivers to Cross" on the PBS channel, one of the most important stops was made here.
This city is very different from other cities in the country, as it is dominated by Arabic culture rather than African culture.
The Kruger National Park is located in the northeast of South Africa, along the border with Mozambique to the east, and with Zimbabwe to the north; the Crocodile River serves as its southern border.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km²; it is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which is home to different wild animals.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the leading national park in South Africa (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there is a daily fee for its protection and visitation.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which allows you to visit South African national parks either selectively or in their entirety.
The territory of Hong Kong was named after Hong Kong Island, a place that many tourists consider the main attraction.
The string of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline is compared to a glittering bar chart, framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the most picturesque places in Hong Kong, you should leave the island and head to the coast of the Zhulun Peninsula, which is located opposite.
The largest part of the urban development areas of Hong Kong Island is closely concentrated on the land reclaimed from the sea on the north shore.
This is the place that the British colonizers took for themselves, and if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest belt of coastal mangrove forests, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the shore inland in Bangladesh and India.
Sundarban has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A part of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarban National Park.
These forests are not just mangrove swamps - they also include some of the last remaining primeval jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square km, of which about a third is covered by water or swamps.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife reserve, and according to estimates, there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer living on its territory.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakarta/Bumang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since intercity buses are often crowded, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are convenient and reliable.
A minibus is a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
These two towers reach a height of 83 meters, and the bridge itself is 378 meters long and has two traffic lanes 3.5 meters wide.
The height of the substructure is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
According to the plan, the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting the area now occupied by eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region served as home to different groups of local tribes, for example the Guaycuru and Payaguá, who survived through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, which was previously called the "huge province of the East Indies", emerged as a result of the clash between Spanish conquerors and local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has largely managed to preserve much of its distinct character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams, as well as the best players in the world in sports like polo.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Less major tournaments and matches can also be watched here at other times of the year.
To find out the latest news about polo matches and where to buy tickets for them, visit the website of the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the value of which is equivalent to the value of one British pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on these islands, which is located in Port Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
As a rule, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands. Credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards may not be accepted on remote islands, although British and American currency may be accepted; clarify in advance with the owners which method of payment is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside of the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, there is summer when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity creates a colder feel than what the thermometer shows.
There are no particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons here: the amount of precipitation is approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the nature is still wild, so you should not feed or disturb the animals.
The park administration warns: do not approach bears and wolves any closer than 100 yards/meters, and any closer than 25 yards/meters to all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may appear, bison, elk, bears, and virtually all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep the necessary distance. These animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so respect their personal space.
Also, remember that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid cooking or carrying smelly food with you, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The bay was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the US and Britain refused to leave the bay.
All the ships sank, except for one British cruiser. About 200 American and German sailors died.
During the Mau movement's struggle for independence, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the assassination of the supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Leaofi III.
There are many beaches here, as Auckland is located on the shores of two harbors. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour area) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of these beaches are sandy with safe swimming, and many of them are shaded by trees such as the hutukara.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the central area of Auckland, where the prestigious suburbs of Mischin Bay and St Heliers are situated on the Waitemata Harbour.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the shore, and swimming is safe.
The most popular local beer is "Number One", it has a simple, pleasant and refreshing taste. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines that can be drunk, but New Zealand and Australian wines can be better transported.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are still concerned, it is easy to find bottled water.
Australians don’t understand the idea of “flat white”. “Small black” is an espresso, and they serve cappuccino with a high layer of whipped cream (not foam), and tea without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Although fruit juices are expensive, they are of excellent quality.
There are a lot of trips to the reef year-round, and injuries caused by any of these reasons on the reef are rare.
Still, follow the recommendations of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Cubomedusa is found near beaches and river mouths north of 1770 from October to April, and sometimes outside of this period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not lead an active life in the ocean, and their main habitat is the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking allows the traveler not to worry about where to stay upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agents often make deals with specific hotels, but you can book through a travel agent for other forms of accommodation, such as campsites.
Travel agents usually sell package deals that include breakfast, transfer to/from the airport or even combined packages that include the flight and hotel stay.
In addition, they can hold the reservation if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for the destination (e.g., a visa).
Any changes or requests must first be sent to the travel agency, and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of attendees sleep on the festival grounds, and most consider this a mandatory part of the program.
If you want to be close to the stage, you need to arrive early to find a campsite near the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages has already finished, there may be areas at the festival where the music will continue to play until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter, find out about the location of your cabin, as passing over ice creates quite a scary noise that can disturb the sleep of the most sensitive people.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include city tours. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos usually make every effort to ensure that visitors spend as much time as possible and spend as much money as possible in the establishment. There are no windows or clocks, and the exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and prevent them from leaving the establishment.
Some establishments offer free alcohol. However, intoxication clouds the mind, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who is going to travel through high-altitude areas or mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice or frost.
On an icy and snowy road, the friction is low, and you won't be able to drive your car the same way as on regular asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow to cause a traffic jam can fall in a very short period of time.
Visibility may also be limited due to snowfall, blizzards, condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, snow and ice weather conditions are normal in many countries, and road traffic continues all year round with almost no interruptions.
A safari is probably the biggest drawcard for tourists in Africa and the main event for many travellers.
The term "safari" in everyday use means a land trip with the aim of seeing the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, often come close to cars, so even with regular equipment, you can get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, and you will see them better through binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bushwalking safari" or "walking safari") consists of a hike lasting from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events taking place in different locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will become the only city in Asia to host the Summer Olympics twice; the first time was in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the date was postponed, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies may vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-related rules do not apply to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most tickets for the events will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a standard ticket price of around 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes helps them dry faster. Many hotels rent out irons and ironing boards, even if they are not present in the room.
If you don't have an iron to hand or aren't keen on the idea of wearing ironed socks, you can try a hairdryer if you have one.
Do not expose the fabric to too high temperatures (which can cause shrinkage or, in very rare cases, burns).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, it is enough to boil the water for a minute, in others it will take a few minutes.
Filters work differently, and in case of doubt, you should consider buying water in sealed bottles from a trustworthy company.
Travelers may encounter pests they have not seen in their home countries.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, even worse, cause allergic reactions, release toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can cause injury or death are generally not considered pests.
Shopping with a "duty-free" discount is an opportunity to buy goods without taxes and excise duties in certain outlets.
Travelers heading to high-tax countries can sometimes save a significant amount, especially on items such as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fermoyle has the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, often passing through isolated, desolate, and wooded areas.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, be careful: steep slopes, narrow alleys, and sharp turns are common.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than on the previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than elsewhere.
However, oddly enough, mobile phone coverage is much better here than in many other parts of the route, for example in Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is quite good. In Bavaria it is abundant and varied and resembles the pastry of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, those with apples are available all year round, while cherries and plums appear in the summer.
Almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts are often used in German baking. Often, popular cakes go perfectly with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small, but hearty, baked goods, try what is called, depending on the region, oladji or poñcakes with filling.
Curry is a dish made from herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the liquid content, curry can be "dry" or "wet".
In the interior regions of Pakistan and northern India, yogurt is actively used in curry. In southern India and in certain regions on the coast of the subcontinent, coconut milk is usually used.
Indonesian cuisine, with its 17,000 islands to choose from, is a general term used to describe the vast variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But without qualification, the term most often implies food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is now widespread throughout the archipelago, includes a range of simply seasoned dishes. The Javanese prefer flavourings such as peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet, hanging from both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with better stability, but there may be safety issues, as there is a risk of getting a foot caught.
If the horse throws off the rider, but his foot gets stuck in the stirrup, the running horse can drag him along. To minimize this risk, a number of precautions can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel, which have a smooth and fairly thin sole.
In addition, some saddles, especially English ones, are equipped with safety bars, which cause the leather stirrup to fall off the saddle if the rider falls backward.
The Coquimbo Valley is the main destination in Chile for mountaineering. It is known as the Yosemite of South America and has a large number of large granite walls and cliffs.
At the top, you can enjoy stunning mountain landscapes. Climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes in its enormous potential for mountaineering.
Winter mountain sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending a snow-covered terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is the main tourist destination for many ski enthusiasts (they are sometimes also called "ski bums") who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a particular place.
The idea of skiing is very old: rock drawings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BCE!
Skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first skiing club for recreation in Australia.
This activity is also called backcountry, ski touring, or hiking on skis.
This is related, but usually does not include hiking to the summit and then descending down unprepared slopes, as skiing across the plain requires more rigid skis and boots.
Imagine that the ski route is a hiking route.
Under good conditions, you can cover a greater distance than when walking, but you can only develop this speed on cross-country skis in extremely rare cases when you don't have a heavy backpack and there is a marked trail.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent states. In ordinary circumstances, traveling through many countries would mean the need to apply for visas and go through passport control multiple times.
But the Schengen zone functions in this regard as a single country.
While in this zone, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each of the Schengen countries separately, which will save you time and money, as well as avoid paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured goods are antiques. Some tax authorities define goods that are 100 years old as antiques.
This concept has geographical variations, in which the age limit can be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be defined as antiques, despite the fact that they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding this activity is also important for many other professions.
Although this is the tradition, not all members of the Saami people engaged in mass breeding of reindeer; they lived off fishing, hunting, and other similar activities, using reindeer mainly as pack animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sami region of Lapland.
Although the word "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Roma, it is often considered offensive because of the associations it carries with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Roma people.
If the country you are planning to visit is subject to travel advisories warning against travel there, this may affect your travel health insurance or your cancellation insurance.
You may also want to consult other governments besides your own, but their advice is aimed at their own citizens.
Here's one example: US citizens in the Middle East may face situations that Europeans or Arabs cannot.
Information reports only briefly describe the political situation in one country.
The opinions expressed are often superficial, vague and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information that is widely available.
Adverse weather conditions are a general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social upheaval, or loss of life.
Adverse weather conditions exist all over the world, and they come in various types that depend on geography, terrain, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall and forest fires are manifestations and effects of severe weather phenomena such as storms, tornadoes, waterspouts and hurricanes.
Regional and seasonal dangerous weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, and dust and sandstorms.
Travellers are strongly advised to take into account any risks associated with harsh weather in their area, as they may affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone must undergo professional training.
A search online for the phrase "security course in a hostile environment" may yield the address of a local company.
In the course, all the topics covered here are usually discussed in much more detail, often with practical training.
The course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing scenarios, a large amount of first aid information, and sometimes training with weapons.
Books and magazines that tell about survival in the wild are common, but there are not many publications about war zones.
People planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without a gender designation (X) or documents updated to reflect a desired name and gender varies from place to place.
The willingness of foreign governments to fulfill their obligations under these documents is equally varied.
Security checks at checkpoints have also become much more thorough since the events of September 11, 2001.
Transgender people preparing for surgery should not expect to be able to go through scanners without their privacy and dignity being violated.
A rip current is a current created by waves that break against the shore, or sometimes against a reef or something similar.
The reverse flow is concentrated in several deeper areas, where rapid currents can form, descending to great depths, due to this similar underwater topography.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion when attempting to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back won't be any harder than usual.
Try to go somewhere where you won't be caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, you may want to wait for rescue.
Culture shock upon returning to one's home country comes earlier than culture shock (here the more brief romantic period), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapt to new cultures sometimes find it especially difficult to re-adapt to their home culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you are adapted to a new culture and have lost some of the habits of your home culture.
When you first went abroad, people were likely to be patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adapt to a new country.
It may come as a surprise to people that patience and understanding are also required for travellers returning home.
The sound and light show against the backdrop of the pyramid is one of the most interesting events in this area for children.
The pyramids can be seen in the dark, and you can also see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually, the noise of tourists and vendors can always be heard. The story of sound and light is like a book of stories.
The Sphinx acts as a backdrop and narrator for a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
Several countries claim the South Shetland Islands, which were first opened in 1819. The most bases are located on these islands, and in 2020, sixteen were operational.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers from the peninsula. The largest island is named after King George, with the settlement of Villa las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the submerged caldera of an active volcano forms an impressive natural harbor.
The land of the Antarctic Peninsula is the area to the south, washed by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of this peninsula here merge with the plateau, and then rise up again to form the 360-kilometer-long Elsworth mountain range, divided into two parts by the Minnesota glacier.
In the northern part, that is, on the Sentinele Range, are the highest mountains of Antarctica - the Vinson Massif, the highest point of which reaches 4892 m and is called Vinson Peak.
In remote areas outside the range of mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
As a rule, a satellite phone is not a replacement for a mobile phone, since you need to be outside in an area in direct satellite range to make a call.
The service is often used in shipping, including leisure and high-speed vessels, where there is a need for remote data and voice communication.
As a rule, you will be able to obtain additional information about connecting this service by contacting your local telephone operator.
An option that is becoming increasingly popular for those planning to take an academic year is to travel and study.
This is especially popular among high school graduates, allowing them to take a year off before entering university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, studying abroad during an academic break can indeed increase your chances of getting into a top university back home.
As a rule, a tuition fee is charged when enrolling in such educational programs.
Finland is an excellent place for boating tourism. In the "land of a thousand lakes", there are also thousands of islands on the lakes and in the archipelagos along the coast.
When exploring archipelagos or visiting lakes, you can easily do without a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes can accommodate any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks leave a completely different impression.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for seven or eight people.
A similar situation is seen in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in other cases it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands this figure ranges from one to forty).
Most individual Baltic cruises include an extended stop in Russia's St. Petersburg.
This means that you can spend several full days in this historic city, but you will have to return to the ship to sleep.
If you only go to the shore as part of a ship excursion, you won't need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures feature Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map at the top, Berlin is far from the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying can be daunting for anyone of any age or social status, especially if it's their first flight or if they've had a traumatic experience in the past.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from personal dislike and fear of other things that many people have.
Understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome the fear that arises from ignorance or the inability to control the process.
Delivery services are well paid for fast delivery. Often, the speed of delivery of commercial documentation, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs is very important.
Some larger companies have their own planes on some routes, but for other routes and smaller companies, this has been a problem.
If they sent anything as air cargo, then on some routes, unloading and customs clearance could take several days.
The only way to deal with it more quickly is to send it as checked baggage. The airline's regulations do not allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, so your participation is required here.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay for the privilege (or, better yet, get your company to pay for you).
However, it is not cheap at all - by experience, you will pay four times more for business class than for economy class, and eleven times more for first class!
As a rule, there is no point in even looking for discounts on business class or first class for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay a premium for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, which is why they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multinational republic that has fallen victim to an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been restored.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is Turkey's third-largest city with a population of around 3.7 million, the largest port after Istanbul, and an excellent transport hub.
The once ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, developed and bustling commercial center, situated along a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
Broad boulevards, buildings with glass facades and modern shopping centers are interspersed with traditional roofs made of red tiles, an 18th-century market, old mosques and churches, although the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than traditional Turkey.
From the village of Halldorsvik, there is a view of the nearby Esturuy Island, and there is also an unusual octagonal church located there.
In the church cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves over some graves.
It’s worth taking half an hour to walk around this unusual village.
Not far to the north is the romantic and charming town of Sintra, celebrated by Lord Byron and since then known throughout the world.
The Scotturb bus number 403 makes regular trips to Sintra and stops at Cape Roca.
To the north, you can also visit the Great Temple of Our Lady of Fatima (the mausoleum) - the site of world-famous apparitions of the Virgin Mary.
Please remember that you are, in principle, standing on the site of a common grave, as well as a place that is unspeakably important to a significant percentage of the inhabitants of the globe.
There are many more men and women alive who survived their time here, but there are even more people whose loved ones were killed here or worked to death here, whether they were Jews or people of other nationalities.
Please treat this place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Don't joke about the Holocaust and the Nazis.
Do not defile this place by painting or scratching graffiti on the objects around it.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, most people understand it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as it is the first official language by law.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other public places.
Ordinary announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unscheduled interruptions are announced by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known to be self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Even if it is often just a false stereotype, the best way to succeed in Paris is to behave in the best possible way, as a "bien élevé" (well-bred) person. This will significantly facilitate adaptation in this city.
The unfriendly appearance of Parisians will immediately disappear if you show a little basic courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mostly with beech, fir and pine trees, and is a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a combination of microclimates, different soils, and altitude differences, it features a particularly wide variety of plant communities.
The area is teeming with a huge variety of animals and birds.
Here you can encounter rare representatives of the fauna, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat, and capercaillie, as well as many other common species of animals.
When visiting monasteries, women must be dressed in skirts below the knee and with their shoulders covered.
In most monasteries, they provide robes for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in a particularly bright color, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men must wear pants that cover their knees.
They can also be borrowed at the entrance, but this clothing is not washed after each use, so you may not be comfortable in these skirts. One size fits all men!
The cuisine of Majorca, as well as the cuisines of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on vegetables, bread, and meat (especially pork), with the widespread use of olive oil.
A simple and popular lunch dish, especially in the summer, is Pa-amb-oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any filling you have available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word Sie, meaning You, are always written with a capital letter even in the middle of a sentence.
It is important to distinguish between verbs and adverbs.
It also likely makes reading easier, while writing is somewhat complicated by the need to determine whether a verb or adjective is being used in the substantivized form.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively simple, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
You should be especially careful with the letters c and g, as their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel.
Don’t forget that r and rr are pronounced differently: caro means “expensive”, while carro means “cart”.
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this textbook on Persian grammar will help you learn a lot of new things and better understand expressions.
Obviously, if you speak a Romance language sub-group, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish may hastily conclude that Portuguese is similar enough and can be learned separately.
Ancient observatories are generally considered obsolete today and serve as museums or educational institutions.
Since light pollution was not as much of a problem during their heyday, they are usually located in cities or on campuses that are easier to access than those built in our time.
Most modern research telescopes are huge structures in remote locations with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The practice of admiring the blossoming of sakura, called "hanami", became a part of Japanese culture back in the 8th century.
This idea came from China, where the favorite flower was plum-colored.
In Japan, the first celebrations of the sakura bloom were arranged by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so don't be tempted to take even just one specimen.
If you visit an officially organized garden, collecting "samples" will also result in you being kicked out without any discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to be, with easy navigation and almost everything available to buy upon arrival.
But, being in the "deep tropics" only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with both heat (constantly) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
There are also several buses heading north to Hebron, the legendary burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as well as their wives.
Make sure the bus you are getting on is going to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways could be a good theme for any celebration.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, taking a cruise along the sights of the Danube, or travelling by boat along the Erie Canal.
They also identify paths for popular walking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night without going to bed, in some open space, in order to see the sunrise.
Of course, this tradition has a Christian theological explanation, but it may also be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold Easter services on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with worshippers usually starting the celebration of Christ's resurrection at midnight.
All the animals that originally arrived on these islands got here by swimming, flying or being washed up by the tide.
Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to reach the islands, making the giant tortoise the primary herbivorous animal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans arrived on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctica in winter, you will experience a polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This presents a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, because the sky will be more or less dark for 24 hours.
Since these areas are sparsely populated, and as a result, light pollution is often not an issue, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
The costumes are standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by their last name or by their position.
Harmony in the workplace is extremely important, and the results of group work are valued above individual achievements.
Normally, employees must obtain permission from their supervisor before making any decisions and are required to carry out their supervisor's orders without question.
