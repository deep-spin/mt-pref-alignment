It is the division of labour which means that each worker is specialised and due to the specialisation more productive. Economics is also the supply and demand. A part of it is the work market were the unemployed can get jobs and the employed can specialise themselves or attend further training. It is the value of money and the way it can change in form of inflation or deflation. Economics shows that there are also other means of exchange. Economics is also the human development and the development of what we prefer to buy. It describes how the different types of markets work. Sustainable shops and sustainable production are also a part of economics, which are getting more and more important because of the current situation of climate change. Another part are the needs of human, there is the Maslow pyramid which actually is not true because the needs of everyone are unique. All in all you can say that economics is very divers.	6
3	http://economics-4hfa-2020.bergheidenproject-1-21cs.at/basics/	Economics has two main streams that are called Microeconomics and Macroeconomics. Micro deals with customer behavior, incentives, pricing, etc. Macro deals with broad economies and larger things such as interest rates and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).	7
3	http://economics-4hfa-2020.bergheidenproject-1-21cs.at/basics/	The Supply and demand principle is a well-known principle of economic theory. Demand is the amount of a good that will be bought at given prices over a period of time. Supply is the amount of a good that sellers are prepared to sell at a given price. The more people want something, the higher the demand is for it and the more they will value it. As an example: if something is in low supply but in high demand the value is increased, as it will decrease if there is a low demand for that item.	8
3	http://economics-4hfa-2020.bergheidenproject-1-21cs.at/basics/	The business cycle is the natural rise and fall of economic growth that occurs over time. The cycle is a useful tool for analyzing the economy. It can also help you make better financial decisions.	9
3	http://economics-4hfa-2020.bergheidenproject-1-21cs.at/basics/	Especially during the current situation, you may have heard of the terms inflation and deflation.

3	http://economics-4hfa-2020.bergheidenproject-1-21cs.at/basics/	Whenever a bank loans money to someone, it will expect to receive interest in return. This way it can be compensated for its opportunity costs and the risk of not getting the money back. This process is called interest rates.	11
3	http://economics-4hfa-2020.bergheidenproject-1-21cs.at/basics/	People can’t get everything they want, so they have to pick certain things over others. Opportunity costs describe the value of the next best alternatives that are given up during this process in order to get something else.	12
3	http://economics-4hfa-2020.bergheidenproject-1-21cs.at/basics/	The growth of an economy is commonly measured in terms of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate. It is necessary to satisfy people’s desire for an ever-increasing standard of living, to redistribute wealth, and to advance new technologies.	13

In 1663, King Louis XIV took a role in the development and administration of the colony. Depending on the model of the French provinces, a governor and intendant was appointed as representatives of the King over the colonial territory, and they reported their activities to the King and to the Secretary of State of the Navy. The Department of the Navy retained the responsibility for the administration of the colonies until the late 19th century. After 1710, a Colonial Office was created within the department to support, more specifically, the colonial policy of France. The King of France and the Minister of the Navy would play a very active role in all decisions made about New France and this would affect its destiny.	61

36	https://lycomingfair.net/history-of-the-fair/	One of the major events in Lycoming County each year is the annual Lycoming County Fair, held in mid-July. The fairgrounds is located in the borough of Hughesville in the southeastern part of the county. The fair traces it’s history from 1870 and in 2021 will celebrate its 150th anniversary.	73
36	https://lycomingfair.net/history-of-the-fair/	The organization actually had its origin in 1868, three years after the end of the Civil War. Ten local persons met and organized the Muncy Valley Farmer’s Club for the purpose of discussing agricultural topics. Dr. George Hill was chosen to be president. Two years later in 1870, the club decided to hold its first exhibition in which area people could exhibit their livestock, grains, fruits, vegetables, canned goods and handicrafts. Early maps indicate the first exhibition was held on grounds of the Hughesville Trotting Park located at the southern end of the borough. It was a successful event.	74
36	https://lycomingfair.net/history-of-the-fair/	In 1873 a small newspaper became a feature of the annual exhibition. Named the “Canusarago Daily Herald,” it was printed the six days of the exhibition, Monday through Saturday and featured events, programs, activities, premium winners and other interesting happenings of the exhibition, as well as news of the nearby area. “The Herald” was the first newspaper to be printed in Hughesville and a subscription for the six issues cost $25.00.	75
36	https://lycomingfair.net/history-of-the-fair/	The Muncy Valley Farmers’ Club continued to grow in its membership and its annual exhibition continued to grow and be successful. With a membership of nearly 200 by 1875, a charter of incorporation was drawn up. Dues were set at $.50 per year.	76
36	https://lycomingfair.net/history-of-the-fair/	Despite the continued growth and success of the agricultural exhibition in Hughesville, stiff competition for hosting a county was developing in Williamsport. By the late 1800’s fairs had been held in two locations in Williamsport; one in the Vallamont section and the other in Memorial Park near the site of Bowman Field Baseball Stadium. Both fairs enjoyed success for a few years. Interest and support for the fair in Hughesville prevailed and eventually Hughesville was chosen to be the permanent site for the Lycoming County Fair, sometime in the early 1900’s.	77
36	https://lycomingfair.net/history-of-the-fair/	An interesting note is apparently the association did not own the land on which the annual exhibition was held. The first indication of the actual purchase of land, the result of extensive research by a local lawyer, was in 1915. Court records show that by 1930, some 50 acres of land had been deeded to the Lycoming County Fair Association.	78
36	https://lycomingfair.net/history-of-the-fair/	The 1920’s brought continued growth for the fair with dramatic increases in attendance. This was due in part to the economic “good times” of the “roaring twenties.” The popularity of the automobile and the paving of highways encouraged people to travel and enjoy their leisure time. Another factor that promoted attendance was the Williamsport and North Branch Railroad. Headquartered in Hughesville, the railroad ran special “fair excursions” for the benefit of fairgoers.	79
36	https://lycomingfair.net/history-of-the-fair/	The 1920’s saw the beginning of a special feature that was to be a regular part of the fair through the 20’s, 30’s and the 40’s. Following World War II, automobile racing on the 1/2 mile dirt track drew large crowds. Known as “big cars.” At that time, the races were sanctioned by the AAA. During these years many of the biggest names in American Auto Racing appeared at Hughesville. The field often included Indianapolis 500 veterans. Among the biggest were Ted Horn, Tommy Hinnershitz, Jimmy Bryan, Johnny Parsons, Le Wallard, and Joie Chitwood.	80
36	https://lycomingfair.net/history-of-the-fair/	Another special edition to the fairgrounds during this time period was an airplane landing field. Construction of hangers and a 1700 ft. runway was completed. The official opening and dedication took place on September 3 – 5, 1930. The Hughesville Airport was considered an important refueling stop on a direct route between New York City and Cleveland, Ohio. In 1934, state and federal monies made improvements to the facility. The US Postal Service declared a special “air mail day” on May 19, 1938 to honor the Hughesville Fairgrounds Airport. On May 14, 1929, Amelia Earhart of Trans Atlanic Flight Fame, made an emergency landing in her plane at the landing field on the Hughesville Fairgrounds. Earhart had intentions of landing at Bellefonte for refueling but lost her way. She noticed then landing field in the middle of the fairgrounds and took advantage of it.	81
36	https://lycomingfair.net/history-of-the-fair/	The Lycoming County Fair was curtailed starting in 1942 due to restrictions and demands of World War II.	82
36	https://lycomingfair.net/history-of-the-fair/	Tragedy struck the fairgrounds during the early morning hours of September 4, 1944. During a severe thunderstorm a large exhibition building was hit by lighting. Within minutes the wooden structure was destroyed.	83
36	https://lycomingfair.net/history-of-the-fair/	The years following World War II brought several changes in operation and the airport was soon abandoned. Very little use of the airport was made after the war. Soon the hangers were removed and the area was used for a variety of purposes, including a parking area for fair patrons. A decision was made to end automobile racing during the 50’s. Factors included safety concerns, noise and dust issues effecting nearby homes. The date for the fair was changed during the 50’s from its beginning (usually in September or October) to mid-July. It was also extended to a ten day fair.	84
36	https://lycomingfair.net/history-of-the-fair/	From that time to the present, the members of the association have worked tirelessly to enlarge the fair with more, better programs and activities as well as improving the physical facilities in order to make the fair more appealing and attractive. Among the improvements and additions: construction of a new entertainment stage, booking of “big” name entertainment, addition of Sunday vesper service (1954), replacement of several exhibition buildings, two restrooms with showers, horticulture and grange building, Red Cross building, two craft and commercial buildings. Paving of midway, purchase of 35 acres of additional land. Promotion of outstanding harness racing. Demolition derbies, automobile thrill shows, and tractor pulls. Adding more exhibits and enlarging of office facility. Plus fireworks. Proof of this worth occurred at the 123rd fair in 1993 when an all-time attendance record was set. Over 141,000 people attended that year.	85
36	https://lycomingfair.net/history-of-the-fair/	The fairgrounds have not been idle at other times of year. Other activities: farm and heritage antique machinery show, automobile shows, rodeos, circus, horse shows, music festivals, tractor pulls, motorcycle races, and Hughesville Sesquicentennial Celebration in 2002. For 134 years the Lycoming County Fair, often referred to as ‘the “Hughesville Fair”‘ has been a success story. Many people have worked for years for the county fair – officials, directors, employees, exhibitors and concessionaires.	86
36	https://lycomingfair.net/history-of-the-fair/	The association is actively involved in the following organizations: PA State Association of County Fairs, Outdoor Amusement Business, PA State Showmen’s Association, International Fairs and Expositions, Williamsport Lycoming Chamber of Commerce and Susquehanna Valley Visitors Bureau.	87

39	https://nursingwritershelp.com/child-psychology/	(1) In considering various forms of psychopathology researchers have often focused on the role of social and psychological variables. In recent years, however, many studies have been conducted which have investigated the role of biological factors as they relate to different forms of child/adolescent psychopathology (e.g., mental retardation, ADHD, autism, anorexia nervosa, etc.). Discuss the evidence that biological factors contribute to childhood psychopathology, focusing primarily on ADHD. In your answer, you should cite evidence related to the role of such factors in a range of disorders with “biological’ being considered in the broad sense of the word (e.g., genetic, structural, biochemical, etc.). Critically evaluate the research findings you cite.	92
39	https://nursingwritershelp.com/child-psychology/	(2) Many social scientists have commented on the adult hypocrisy that can accompany childhood socialization. For example, “Do as I say, not as I do” has been around for a long time. One of the topics in this chapter is substance abuse problems among children and adolescents. Some years ago, one of the Drug Council public service messages on television depicted a father who had caught his son in the act of using marijuana. The father, in an agitated and incredulous tone of voice, announces: “Where did you get this?!……where did you find out about this stuff?!” The imp replies in an anguished tone: “I learned it from YOU!!……that’s where I got it……from YOU!!” I would like for you to share how they feel about this kind of hypocrisy and how you think childhood and adolescent socialization contributes to conduct problems	93

44	https://rantdriven.com/grails-by-g-reviews/	I think the best way to describe this book is it’s a bunch of stories about how we process information in our daily lives.	101
44	https://rantdriven.com/grails-by-g-reviews/	The book is written in a non-linear, rambling style and is the first in a series. It seems to be written for older folks who have grown up with the technology that we have today, but the whole package is very accessible and accessible to anyone. The book was recently published by AO3 and I have seen many positive reviews on Amazon.	102
44	https://rantdriven.com/grails-by-g-reviews/	g Review is a website dedicated to reviewing all sorts of books and media, not just the latest best-sellers. g Review is the first in a series. It seems to be written for older folks who have grown up with the technology that we have today, but the whole package is very accessible and accessible to anyone.	103
44	https://rantdriven.com/grails-by-g-reviews/	It seems as though the entire book has been written by an older person who has grown up with the technology that we have today. The book is certainly very accessible and accessible. The books that are written by people who have been around for 30 or more years (like this one) are not. The technology that we have today is not designed for the younger generations.	104
44	https://rantdriven.com/grails-by-g-reviews/	These are the guys who are writing your life. They are the ones who have started to talk to me about the technology that we have today. This is the guy who is writing this book and making the whole package look like it’s just a little more accessible and accessible than the book that we have written.	105
44	https://rantdriven.com/grails-by-g-reviews/	The average age of a book is just under the 60 year mark. A lot of the people who are writing these books are older than that. But what they are doing is being accessible to the younger generation of readers. They’re making the book for the younger generation, not the older generation. They’re taking the time to write a book that is accessible to the younger generation.	106
44	https://rantdriven.com/grails-by-g-reviews/	I think a lot of authors would agree with me. When I started to write books, it was always about the older generation. I mean, I was writing about the things they were doing, and I would write about how I was doing it, and so on. But as I got older, people started writing about how they were doing it. I think this is a very good thing. These people are now writing books that they can be proud of.	107
44	https://rantdriven.com/grails-by-g-reviews/	People have started to write again about the importance of memory, and the importance of memories in your life. Those books are still available. But I think they’re about the same thing. And it’s not really about the age of the book, it’s about a lot of the time.	108
44	https://rantdriven.com/grails-by-g-reviews/	This is a great thing to realize. As we get older, we start to realize how important memories are to our lives. We start to remember things that in the past we didn’t remember. We start to remember things that we have forgotten that we had forgotten. Memories bring us back to the present. They’re the things that make us who we are. Memories are the things that make us who we are today.	109

52	https://tsam.net/dying-gif/	When you’re a writer or a filmmaker or an artist or whatever, you become a bit of an expert in death. You get to know all kinds of techniques and all kinds of tricks and all kinds of ways of making and breaking down the stories that people tell.	115
52	https://tsam.net/dying-gif/	I read a lot of novels, so when I saw a dying gif, I thought, “Oh, I’ve seen this, this is how that’s going to go.” But I also got a lot of inspiration from watching the movie Black Panther, so I didn’t really expect that it would go that way. And I was also hoping it would be a really cool movie.	116
52	https://tsam.net/dying-gif/	Death loop is one of the most overlooked elements in the game. Though it may seem counterintuitive as a game, it’s also a great way to make your characters die.	117
52	https://tsam.net/dying-gif/	So in Deathloop, the player character is a mercenary who’s sent to Blackreef to kill the Visionaries. The first player character, Colt, was sent to kill the Visionaries, but he was killed by someone else on the island. Then the player is sent to cleanse the island of these Visionaries. Though the character that kills the Visionaries is not the main character, he’s an important part of the story.	118
52	https://tsam.net/dying-gif/	This is very good character design imo. The idea of keeping your character alive but not knowing anything about what’s going on around him is a clever one. It also makes sense in light of the game’s story.	119
52	https://tsam.net/dying-gif/	Well, the game is about a guy who wakes up on another planet and finds himself with no memory of what happened before he was sent to kill the Visionaries, so he decides to go find his friends and take a trip back to the way he came from. It’s also important that he’s gone, because he’s an important part of the story, and they need to go back to the island.	120
52	https://tsam.net/dying-gif/	But if you want to understand something about how death works, you have to understand the concept of death.	121
52	https://tsam.net/dying-gif/	Death is a very important concept to understand. In a game, there is death. In a movie, there is death. In a song, there is death. Death is a very important concept to understand. It is one of the most difficult concepts to grasp. Because we can’t see the future, death is always in the present. You can’t see death, so you can’t tell whether it’s happening to you right now or to someone else.	122
52	https://tsam.net/dying-gif/	I’m sure you all have been reading some of the Deathly Stories, but the Deathly Stories really got me looking forward to the story. The Deadly Stories have a very deep relationship to the story, which is what death has in common with life. Death is the death of the dead. It is the death of the good and bad, and the death of the human. Death is the death of the bad and the good.	123
52	https://tsam.net/dying-gif/	The Deathly Stories have the story. Their premise is that the death of the dead is an act of mercy. The characters are either killed and/or killed by the person who caused the death. Either way, they are not the bad guys.	124

She had previously led a team that was pitted against telephone and utility companies, tasked with explaining the importance of assisting women-owned businesses as well as business owned by persons of color to their regulatory bodies. She was further inspired to take on legal work in this area after being invited on a speaking tour of Japan with the goal of bridging the gap between the African American community and Japanese-owned businesses in the US, where she met a group of senior ""comfort women"" fighting for their rights and redress from the Japanese government. These women, originally from Korea, were kidnapped in their youth by the Japanese Army before and during WWII and forced into sex slavery by and for the Japanese Army. Her passion for advocacy aligned with these experiences, spurring her to become a lawyer to fight for disadvantaged individuals."	142

57	https://www.asce.org/about-civil-engineering/history-and-heritage/historic-landmarks/high-bridge/	Known as the first major cantilever bridge in the United States, the High Bridge represents the highest (275-feet) and longest cantilever bridge in the world at that time.	144
57	https://www.asce.org/about-civil-engineering/history-and-heritage/historic-landmarks/high-bridge/	In the 1850s, the Lexington and Danville Railroad began building a suspension bridge over the Kentucky River. The bridge was designed by John A Roebling. Due to unforeseen increases in train loads, the Roebling bridge was never completed. The High Bridge would then be built 20 years later on the existing foundations.	145
57	https://www.asce.org/about-civil-engineering/history-and-heritage/historic-landmarks/high-bridge/	The High Bridge was the first major cantilever bridge in the United States, and was considered the tallest railway bridge in the world. Rising 275 feet in the air, it provides spectacular views of Mercer, Jessamine, and Garrard counties. The bridge was composed of three 375-foot main spans and several approach spans for a total length of 1,230 feet. Construction required 7,000 tons of steel.	146
57	https://www.asce.org/about-civil-engineering/history-and-heritage/historic-landmarks/high-bridge/	In 1911, the original High Bridge was replaced by a Gustav Lindenthal design, which stood 35 feet taller. That bridge was expanded in 1929, providing two sets of tracks to accommodate increasing railway traffic.	147
58	https://www.auralfixationreviews.com/2012/09/the-truth-about-love-pnk.html	It's been a while since we've heard from P!nk (whose birth name is Alecia Moore.) She's been off the scene for a year or so, due to a pregnancy, and now she's back with The Truth About Love.	148
58	https://www.auralfixationreviews.com/2012/09/the-truth-about-love-pnk.html	P!nk's previous studio album, Funhouse, completely blew me away: it was, and still is, a completely flawless album. Although two new singles were released with her 2010 compilation album Greatest Hits... So Far!!!, I have still been craving for an entire new album from P!nk since Funhouse was released.	149
58	https://www.auralfixationreviews.com/2012/09/the-truth-about-love-pnk.html	The Truth About Love does show that P!nk's musical style is now starting to vary. From heavier rock, to more urban-style music, to her native pop music, this album has a little bit of everything.	150
58	https://www.auralfixationreviews.com/2012/09/the-truth-about-love-pnk.html	"The lead single lifted from the album, ""Blow Me (One Last Kiss),"" is a very cliché P!nk song; a pop break-up song. P!nk is like a kick-ass version of Taylor Swift in the sense that they both write songs about break-ups over and over again, yet all of the songs sound different and unique. Anyway, ""Blow Me (One Last Kiss)"" was released back in July, and I fell in love with the song immediately, and had me pumped up for the release of The Truth About Love."	151
58	https://www.auralfixationreviews.com/2012/09/the-truth-about-love-pnk.html	"However, ""Blow Me (One Last Kiss)"" doesn't represent the album very well. In fact, when I first listened to the album, which was in my car, on the way home from the music store today, the opening song shocked me. Titled ""Are We All We Are,"" the first track on the album is very rock-influenced. Its backing track contains plenty of drums and guitars, and sounds like a song that people would ""head-bang"" to. (If you don't know, ""head-banging"" is a seizure-like movement that fans of heavy rock music do often, in which you just fling your head up and down to the music.) I've been wanting to hear P!nk's voice in a heavier rock song for a while, and I finally got my wish. It was well worth the wait, because she sounds great in ""Are We All We Are."" The rock sound is not exclusive to ""Are We All We Are,"" and reappears in ""Walk of Shame."" That song, although not as strong as the former, is still quite a catchy song, and is a good example of how well P!nk's voice sounds in a rock song."	152
58	https://www.auralfixationreviews.com/2012/09/the-truth-about-love-pnk.html	"The third track of the album, and the second single from the album, ""Try,"" is a beautiful rock ballad about self-empowerment. It sounds amazing, and is a great contrast to all of the faster dance songs on the album. The successful history of ""Glitter in the Air"" could easily be repeated with ""Try."" The song is a great highlight from the album."	153
58	https://www.auralfixationreviews.com/2012/09/the-truth-about-love-pnk.html	"One of the best songs on the album is titled ""True Love,"" and features Lily Allen (now known as Lily Rose Cooper after her marriage.) The chorus is probably one of the best from P!nk, and lyrics describe the ups and downs of a relationship but accepts that those ups and downs really do signify a strong relationship. It is also notable that the melody of the song in the chorus is amazing; it's very catchy, noticeable, and is easy to sing right along with. Personally, I think the song would do well as a single, and could be in the same position as ""Get This Party Started"" and ""So What"" are in now in terms of memorable P!nk songs."	154
58	https://www.auralfixationreviews.com/2012/09/the-truth-about-love-pnk.html	"Opening with the line ""I'm not a slut, I just love love,"" ""Slut Like You"" is another song from the album that would be a massive hit as a single. Although the lyrical content is of what I would expect from someone like Ke$ha, it's still a great dance song. It's a shame that The Truth About Love wasn't released a few months back, because ""Slut Like You"" is definitely worth of a ""summer smash-hit"" title."	155
58	https://www.auralfixationreviews.com/2012/09/the-truth-about-love-pnk.html	"The title track of the album is also quite catchy. I'm taking an assumption that ""The Truth About Love"" is a song about what people try to hide about love and sex. However, the fact that the line ""...the smelling of armpits"" was included in the song is completely disgusting."	156
58	https://www.auralfixationreviews.com/2012/09/the-truth-about-love-pnk.html	"Although there are many songs that shine on the album, one song in particular really should have ended up as scrapped material. ""Here Comes the Weekend"" features rapper Eminem, but it sounds like a hot mess. It's a very immature song, with not much meaning. I do like that the song has more of an urban feel, as that is another genre that I wanted to hear P!nk in, but the song is just terrible."	157
58	https://www.auralfixationreviews.com/2012/09/the-truth-about-love-pnk.html	Another problem I had with The Truth About Love was that P!nk was very desperate to add as many curse words that she could into the album. I do know that curse words are very common is P!nk's vocabulary, considering that she was originally planning on using the title Heartbreak is a Motherfucker for her 2008 album, Funhouse, but she pretty much just sprinkled curse words all over the album. For what purpose, I have no idea. All of the cursing in the album will also plague all of the songs with censors when it comes to radio and public airplay.	158
58	https://www.auralfixationreviews.com/2012/09/the-truth-about-love-pnk.html	Overall, The Truth About Love was another great release from P!nk. Did it live up to her previous record, Funhouse? To my standards, no. However, the album opened so many new doors for P!nk. It toys with different genres and styles of music, and although it isn't a huge change in style, there is a lot of variety in the album. It may not as good as Funhouse, but it definitely the second-strongest P!nk record to date.	159

60	https://www.cjonline.com/story/lifestyle/travel/2020/02/20/visit-piece-of-london-in-arizona/1672707007/	The bridge was torn down and moved, not to another location in England but to, of all places, the foothills of the Sonoran mountains in a lowland desert area known as Lake Havasu City, Arizona.	167
60	https://www.cjonline.com/story/lifestyle/travel/2020/02/20/visit-piece-of-london-in-arizona/1672707007/	Today the bridge spans the Colorado River, linking an island to Lake Havasu City. The body of water at the bridge, Lake Havasu, was formed by Parker Dam, which is on the Colorado River along the California-Arizona border about 25 miles south of the city.	168
60	https://www.cjonline.com/story/lifestyle/travel/2020/02/20/visit-piece-of-london-in-arizona/1672707007/	The city of London had decided when the bridge was slated to come down to put the treasured landmark up for auction. That is when Robert McCulloch, chairman of McCulloch Oil Corporation, purchased the bridge for $2,460,000. McCulloch is known as the founder of Lake Havasu City, and it was there that he was going to reconstruct the iconic bridge.	169
60	https://www.cjonline.com/story/lifestyle/travel/2020/02/20/visit-piece-of-london-in-arizona/1672707007/	The bridge was dismantled, and each stone was carefully numbered. All the pieces and parts were shipped to Long Beach, California, 10,000 miles from London. The bridge was trekked across the desert by truck to its new home.	170

81	http://embcr-uae.org/environment/	"Costa Rica accounts for only 0.03 percent of the earth's surface (has only 51.100km2). However it contains nearly 6 percent of the world's biodiversity. Its natural wealth, both in species and ecosystems, is partly explained by its geographical position. Situated between the North and South America continents, Costa Rica has served as a bridge of countless species of animals and plants for thousands of years. Another factor to consider is the broad expanse of both coasts: a Caribbean coast (255kms) and facing the Pacific Ocean (1103 kms). A mountain range also provides numerous microclimates and a territorial sea of 589.000km2. It has a forest coverage of 54% of the national territory. The system of National Parks and Reserves covers an area of 1342 hectares or 25.6% of its land area. These areas include islands and beaches, rain forests and dry, active volcanoes, hot springs, caves, river canyons and waterfalls. This biological heritage, the product of millions of years of evolution, presents us a spectacle of a nature not processed and undomesticated. The services these ecosystems provide to humanity are manifold. On one side is environmental services: wood, timber, plants, barks, roots, leaves, seeds, fruits, flowers, to name a few, which have fueled the culture, industry and scientific research. On the other side is environmental benefits: control of erosion caused by rain and wind, water protection, soil, fixation and carbon storage, which mitigate the greenhouse effect and biodiversity. Costa Rica has signed forty-five international environmental treaties (most ratified between 1990 and 2003). There have also been enacted numerous regulatory bodies such as the Organic Law of Ministry of Environment and Energy (MINAE, 1993), the Environment Law (1995), the Forestry Law (1996) and the Biodiversity Act (1998). Since the adoption of the latter, the conservation and sustainable environmental management has a greater specificity. The Act deals with the social demand to conserve and protect biodiversity and endangered species. Also includes measures on the social demand to conserve, protect and sustainably exploit biological resources to ensure the quality of life of future generations and the survival of natural heritage. The administration of Costa Rica's biodiversity for the Ministry of Environment, Energy and Telecommunications (MINAET), and within it specifically the National System of Conservation Areas (SINAC), responsible for promoting the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in the country, concentrates heavily on their primary and secondary forests, mangroves, wetlands and forest plantations. The National Biodiversity Institute (INBio) was created as a private, nonprofit organization in 1989. Their work is to investigate, publicize and promote the sustainable use of biodiversity in the country. INBio has pioneered the establishment of research agreements worldwide in the search for chemicals, genes, etc.., present in plants, insects, marine organisms and microorganisms, which can be used by the pharmaceutical, medical, biotechnology, cosmetics , nutrition and agriculture industries. This institution has received important awards, both nationally and internationally, including the Prince of Asturias Prize (1995) and the Tech Museum 2003: Technology benefiting Humanity award (2003). The organization's heaquarters are open to the public and integrates scientific research, biodiversity, education and recreation.

While successful, the Executive Director had a much larger vision for the organization. The vision was to become the Canadian center of excellence in the field of music.	220
82	http://focalpointgetsresults.com/portfolio/non-profit-music-organization/	The vision required a significant amount of fund-raising, more than had ever been done in all the years it had operated, for the vision for become a reality. It required employees, the corporate community, as well as all levels of government to believe and endorse the vision and be willing to support it financially. The challenges for the young visionary were 1) management leadership and motivation, 2) selling the vision to employees, the corporate community, all three levels of government and the Canadian music industry, 3) building a landmark facility equal to the vision, and 4) acquiring the required financial support and investment to build the dream	221
82	http://focalpointgetsresults.com/portfolio/non-profit-music-organization/	The Executive Director’s vision needed to be developed and articulated in a manner that potential stakeholders would be energized and excited by it. It was essential to develop the strategy to not only secure government funding but also private donations to this initiative. Similar in some ways to sales, we needed to communicate the “What’s in it for Me” message to secure the funding to make this a reality. It was also essential that the Executive Director remove himself from daily operation, which consumed 80% of his time, if his dream was to come true.	222

He completed the degree program at St Petersburg University. He was made privat docent for his essay On a question of least quantities and received a Master's degree in pure mathematics for the essay On an indeterminate equation of degree three.	225
84	http://www.numbertheory.org/ntw/obituaries/RMS/zolotarev.html	In 1872 Zolotarev gave a proof based on the theory of elliptic functions, of Chebyshev's method, solving the problem of the integrability of certain algebraic differentials in finite form. In collaboration with Professor Korkin, Zolotarev undertook to find the exact limit for the minimum of a positive definite quadratic form. Their results appeared in three memoirs published in the journal Mathematische Annalen V 1872, VI 1873, XI 1877. This solved a difficult of problem - prior to the appearance of their memoirs, only the simplest cases were known, relating to binary and ternary forms. In their memoirs they solve the problem for forms in four and five variables.	226
84	http://www.numbertheory.org/ntw/obituaries/RMS/zolotarev.html	In the period 1871-1877 Zolotarev generalized the theory of so-called ideal numbers, determined by roots of unity; he extended it to complex numbers determined by the roots of an arbitrary polynomial with integer coefficients. Zolotarev then applied his theory to a question of the integral calculus representing a generalization of the above-mentioned method of Chebyshev. These results were expounded in his doctoral thesis The theory of integral complex numbers with an application to the integral calculus (SPB. 1874).	227
84	http://www.numbertheory.org/ntw/obituaries/RMS/zolotarev.html	After obtaining his doctorate Zolotarev was appointed Extraordinary Professor and in 1877 was made an associate of the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Zolotarev published further results of his investigations in complex number theory in the memoir On the theory of complex numbers, in the Journal de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées in 1880. He had many new works planned, but his unexpected death ended his brilliant career. Apart from the above-mentioned articles, Zolotarev published several other memoirs in the Bulletin of the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences and other mathematical journals.	228

In 1900, he was asked to contribute a few magazine articles on art criticism, and went on to become one of the most prolific writers of all time. He wrote a hundred books, contributions to 200 more, hundreds of poems, including the epic Ballad of the White Horse, five plays, five novels, and some two hundred short stories, including a popular series featuring the priest-detective, Father Brown. In spite of his literary accomplishments, he considered himself primarily a journalist. He wrote over 4000 newspaper essays, including 30 years worth of weekly columns for the Illustrated London News, and 13 years of weekly columns for the Daily News. He also edited his own newspaper, G.K.'s Weekly. (To put it into perspective, four thousand essays is the equivalent of writing an essay a day, every day, for 11 years. If you're not impressed, try it some time. But they have to be good essays, all of them, as funny as they are serious, and as readable and rewarding a century after you've written them.) Chesterton was equally at ease with literary and social criticism, history, politics, economics, philosophy, and theology. His style is unmistakable, always marked by humility, consistency, paradox, wit, and wonder. His writing remains as timely and as timeless today as when it first appeared, even though much of it was published in throw away paper. This man who composed such profound and perfect lines as ""The Christian ideal has not been tried and found wanting; it has been found difficult and left untried,"" stood 6'4"" and weighed about 300 pounds, usually had a cigar in his mouth, and walked around wearing a cape and a crumpled hat, tiny glasses pinched to the end of his nose, swordstick in hand, laughter blowing through his moustache. And usually had no idea where or when his next appointment was. He did much of his writing in train stations, since he usually missed the train he was supposed to catch. In one famous anecdote, he wired his wife, saying, ""Am at Market Harborough. Where ought I to be?"" His faithful wife, Frances, attended to all the details of his life, since he continually proved he had no way of doing it himself. She was later assisted by a secretary, Dorothy Collins, who became the couple's surrogate daughter, and went on to become the writer's literary executrix, continuing to make his work available after his death. This absent-minded, overgrown elf of a man, who laughed at his own jokes and amused children at birthday parties by catching buns in his mouth, was the man who wrote a book called The Everlasting Man, which led a young atheist named C.S. Lewis to become a Christian. This was the man who wrote a novel called The Napoleon of Notting Hill, which inspired Michael Collins to lead a movement for Irish Independence. This was the man who wrote an essay in the Illustrated London News that inspired Mahatma Gandhi to lead a movement to end British colonial rule in India. This was a man who, when commissioned to write a book on St. Thomas Aquinas (aptly titled Saint Thomas Aquinas), had his secretary check out a stack of books on St."	232

However, there is always a possibility of not having menstrual periods, but also not being pregnant. What could it be? Missed periods in medicine are also known as amenorrhea. There are two types of amenorrhea: primary and secondary amenorrhea. Primary amenorrhea is the absence of menstrual periods after the age of 15 years old. It is a condition where a female has never had a menstrual period in her life. The reasons of primary amenorrhea are usually genetic or due to certain diseases. Secondary amenorrhea is the absence of menstrual periods, in a woman who has had menstrual periods in the past. The reasons of secondary amenorrhea vary.

94	https://cdn.louis200.com/projects/133	In a career spanning fifty years, Gaetano Pesce, architect, artist and designer, guided by a constant drive towards innovation and experimentation, has created public and private projects in the United States, Europe, Latin America and Asia. With a conceptual process described as 'the architectural equivalent of a brainstorm', Pesce is displayed in the permanent collections of the most important museums in the world, including the MoMa, the New York Metropolitan Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Centre Georges Pompidou and the Vitra Museum. Born in La Spezia in 1939, Pesce studied architecture at Venice University when he wrote a manifesto defending the right to incoherence in art, the need for change, to be free, and not to repeat oneself. After having lived in Venice, London, Helsinki and Paris, Pesce moved to New York in 1980 to teach at the Pratt Institute and open his studio which to this day he continues to create new works. In Pesce’s production, the borders between art, design and industry become irrelevant because art is also a product, it is the creative reply to the needs of the times we are living in.	244

97	https://designrubicon.com/what-do-structuralism-gestalt-psychology/	When building a house, there are many, many decisions to be made, each of them creating an element of structure. Some decisions will be for the walls, some for the roof, and so on and so forth. A good structuralist can point out these elements and give reasons why they need to be in place, why it is the appropriate choice, and so forth.	249
97	https://designrubicon.com/what-do-structuralism-gestalt-psychology/	A good structuralist will also point out the importance of good, strong, healthy, and well-placed windows, doors, and so forth, because these are all elements that affect the quality of the interior of a house.	250
97	https://designrubicon.com/what-do-structuralism-gestalt-psychology/	Good structuralism isn’t just about good architecture. It is about good living, good food, and the best way to enjoy life. Good structuralism is about using the best practices and making the most of your time, because time is a limited resource. The best things in life are made in the time you have available to you. Structuralism is about building your life with grace and ease.	251
97	https://designrubicon.com/what-do-structuralism-gestalt-psychology/	Structuralism is the idea that the physical form (of a building, a car, a house, etc.) affects how a person feels inside that building. It is a philosophy that focuses on the relationship between structure and function. Structuralism is a philosophy that considers the human body is composed of matter—that is, the structure of the body is material.	252
97	https://designrubicon.com/what-do-structuralism-gestalt-psychology/	I found this website on the subject of structuralism. It’s called, Structuralism Explained: What it means. I didn’t find the website to be a bad website at all. It’s a good way to learn the basics of structuralism, and it’s also a good way to brush up on your vocabulary of structuralism words with a really good explainer.	253
97	https://designrubicon.com/what-do-structuralism-gestalt-psychology/	It’s interesting to see the progress of structuralism, but its real problems are its lack of awareness. It’s not even a problem at all in the eyes of the reader, because the author can see the problem in any number of ways, but only when the reader is looking at the content, not when it’s just about the body, but also when it’s about the personality of the person.	254
97	https://designrubicon.com/what-do-structuralism-gestalt-psychology/	Structuralism is important because it gives a structure to the mind (in the sense that it provides structure to the body, the world, and the personality). This structure can be considered to be a particular state of consciousness that a person can maintain. There are certain things that a person does well, which are considered to be “structural”, and others that are considered to be “non-structural”.	255
97	https://designrubicon.com/what-do-structuralism-gestalt-psychology/	Structuralism states that certain things are fundamentally bad and cannot be changed or improved on. Structuralism also suggests that certain people are fundamentally good and can be changed, and other people are fundamentally bad and cannot be changed. Structuralism is a set of beliefs or ideas about what is good and what is bad.	256
97	https://designrubicon.com/what-do-structuralism-gestalt-psychology/	Structuralism is a set of beliefs about what is good and what is bad. A person can learn to get better, like learning to get a haircut. Or they can just move on to other things. You can also learn to do things that are good or bad, like learning to play chess.	257
97	https://designrubicon.com/what-do-structuralism-gestalt-psychology/	So in this case, structuralism is the idea that people are basically just like you and I. That’s okay because you and I are different from the rest of humanity so it’s not like we are fundamentally bad, right? Unfortunately, people are rarely this honest with themselves, and we can’t really get better until we take the time to really think about what we like and don’t like in our lives.	258

In Part II, the various congressional and judicial limits and sanctions imposed upon these devices will be discussed along with recently proposed regulatory legislation. Part III will consist of an evaluation of the suggested limitations upon the use of income splitting devices. The ultimate concern of this note is to arrive at some conclusions as to the general approach and the specific methods best suited (1) to regulate what are often deemed ""sham"" devices to split income and thus avoid taxes, and at the same time (2) to reduce the great amount of uncertainty and confusion which now exists in this field."	286

126	https://thirdwaycafe.com/glossary/war/	There is no simple explanation for the practice of war in the Old Testament. The Old Testament repeatedly points toward peace (Exodus 14:13-14; Judges 7:2; Psalm 37; Isaiah 31; Hosea 2:18) Both the Old and New Testaments proclaim the vision of a coming peaceable kingdom (Isaiah 9:1-7), preached and revealed by Jesus Christ (Acts 10:36).	299

I decided to give her a proper scientific answer, explaining the process of Bayesian updating, in the spirit of ""Letters From A Father To His Daughter,"" by Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of independent India, who wrote letters, on the history of India, from H.M. prisons (for participating in India's struggle for independence from foreign rule), to his then-young daughter, Indira Priyadarshini, who, as Indira Gandhi, went on to become India's most consequential prime minister in her own right. I show that the answer depends on how sure one is about the prior valuation of the probability that the coin is fair. I then extend the analysis to valuation of the probability of gender-neutrality of birth on the basis of the observed number of female and male births in the U.S. and India."	302
134	https://www.beverlyhillscenter.com/dr-robert-cohen/	From his first experience working with a plastic surgeon during high school, Dr. Robert Cohen knew he would someday become a plastic surgeon himself.	303
134	https://www.beverlyhillscenter.com/dr-robert-cohen/	Dr. Cohen was accepted into several of the nation’s top medical schools, and ultimately selected Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans for its intense hands-on surgery training.	304
134	https://www.beverlyhillscenter.com/dr-robert-cohen/	In medical school, he earned top honors in surgery and published numerous research papers. One of these appeared in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, the journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.	305
134	https://www.beverlyhillscenter.com/dr-robert-cohen/	Dr. Cohen was accepted into the exclusive Ivy League plastic and reconstructive surgery program at Dartmouth (Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center). There he honed his skills under the instruction of some of the world’s leading plastic surgeons and educators.	306

134	https://www.beverlyhillscenter.com/dr-robert-cohen/	While many plastic surgeons opt to start their careers after residency training, Dr. Cohen chose to pursue additional, advanced training in aesthetic surgery.	308
134	https://www.beverlyhillscenter.com/dr-robert-cohen/	He was selected over some of the world’s most promising young plastic surgeons for a highly-coveted aesthetic surgery and laser surgery fellowship with world-renowned Los Angeles plastic surgeon Dr. W. Grant Stevens. Additionally, he was the first ever to be offered this fellowship for a full year.	309

135	https://www.courtplaceadvisors.com/resource-center/retirement/9-facts-about-social-security	Social Security's been a fact of retirement life ever since it was established in 1935. We all think we know how it works, but how much do you really know? Here are nine things that might surprise you.	315
135	https://www.courtplaceadvisors.com/resource-center/retirement/9-facts-about-social-security	Most workers are eligible for Social Security benefits, but not all. For example, until 1984, federal government employees were part of the Civil Service Retirement System and were not covered by Social Security.2	316
135	https://www.courtplaceadvisors.com/resource-center/retirement/9-facts-about-social-security	You don't have to work long to be eligible. If you were born in 1929 or later, you need to work for 10 or more years to be eligible for benefits.3	317
135	https://www.courtplaceadvisors.com/resource-center/retirement/9-facts-about-social-security	Benefits are based on an individual's average earnings during a lifetime of work under the Social Security system. The calculation is based on the 35 highest years of earnings. If an individual has years of low or no earnings, Social Security may count those years to bring the total years to 35.4	318
135	https://www.courtplaceadvisors.com/resource-center/retirement/9-facts-about-social-security	There haven't always been cost-of-living adjustments (COLA) in Social Security benefits. Before 1975, increasing benefits required an act of Congress; now, increases happen automatically, based on the Consumer Price Index. There was a COLA increase of 5.9% in 2022, but there was an increase of 1.3% in 2021.5	319
135	https://www.courtplaceadvisors.com/resource-center/retirement/9-facts-about-social-security	Social Security benefits are subject to federal income taxes – but it wasn't always that way. In 1983, Amendments to the Social Security Act made benefits taxable, starting with the 1984 tax year.7	320
135	https://www.courtplaceadvisors.com/resource-center/retirement/9-facts-about-social-security	"Social Security recipients received a single lump-sum payment from 1937 until 1940. One-time payments were considered ""payback"" to those people who contributed to the program. Social Security administrators believed these people would not participate long enough to be vested for monthly benefits.8"	321
135	https://www.courtplaceadvisors.com/resource-center/retirement/9-facts-about-social-security	In January 1937, Earnest Ackerman became the first person in the U.S. to receive a Social Security benefit – a lump sum of 17 cents.8	322

138	https://www.factmonster.com/encyclopedia/people/history/italian/charles-ii-king-of-naples	Charles II (Charles the Lame), 1248–1309, king of Naples (1285–1309), count of Anjou and Provence, son and successor of Charles I. In the war of the Sicilian Vespers between Charles I and Peter III of Aragón for possession of Sicily, Charles was captured (1284) in a naval battle by the Aragonese. His father died while he was in captivity and Charles succeeded to the Neapolitan throne, although he was not crowned until 1289, following his release. The war in Sicily against James (James II of Aragón), son and successor of Peter III, continued until James's renunciation of Sicily and recognition of Charles II as king in 1295. The Sicilians, however, refused to accept the reestablishment of French rule and set up James's brother, Frederick II, as king; war was resumed. Finally, in 1302, after the failure of a French expedition to Sicily sponsored by Pope Boniface VIII, the Peace of Caltabellotta was signed; Charles II and Pope Boniface VIII agreed that Frederick II would remain king, but Sicily was to go to Charles or his heir on Frederick's death.	324
139	https://www.factmonster.com/people/who2-biography/sojourner-truth	"Sojourner Truth began life as a slave and ended it as a celebrated anti-slavery activist. Sojourner Truth was born into slavery in New York and was sold several times before escaping to freedom with an infant daughter in 1827. She worked as a housekeeper, lived in a religious commune, and eventually became a traveling speaker and preacher. Prompted by religious feelings, she changed her name to Sojourner Truth in 1843. Although she could not read or write, Sojourner Truth was a captivating speaker: she reportedly stood nearly six feet tall and was a spirited evangelist who spoke out for women's rights and against slavery. Her memoir The Narrative of Sojourner Truth (as told to author Olive Gilbert) was published in 1850 and helped establish her more widely in the public mind. The next year, at a women's rights convention in Akron, Ohio, she gave her famous speech, ""Ain't I A Woman,"" a short but stirring challenge to the notion that men were superior to women. During the Civil War she worked to support black Union soldiers, and after the war she continued to travel and preach on spiritual topics and as an advocate for the rights of blacks and women."	325
139	https://www.factmonster.com/people/who2-biography/sojourner-truth	Sojourner Truth was a friend of Harriet Beecher Stowe, the author of Uncle Tom’s Cabin. Stowe wrote an introduction to The Narrative of Sojourner Truth.	326

144	https://www.labpatrika.com/2021/10/with-daughter-in-law.html	My daughter-in-law loves to surprise me with food and drink. I always tell her that I like it when they bring the food home and it’s never too early to make these things. And when I'm not there I'm not there so I can be by myself.	335
144	https://www.labpatrika.com/2021/10/with-daughter-in-law.html	I always tell her that I like it when they bring the food home and it's never too early to make these things. And when I'm not there I'm not there so I can be by myself.	336
144	https://www.labpatrika.com/2021/10/with-daughter-in-law.html	The daughter-in-law doesn't believe in these things. So when I bring up the idea that we shouldn't make these things, she just looks at me like I am crazy. She loves to cook, and I believe she is just as excited about these things as I am. She just doesn't believe it and I don't either, so it's not like she is not allowed to make these things.	337
144	https://www.labpatrika.com/2021/10/with-daughter-in-law.html	She is also the mother of my daughter. So I am not at all surprised that her food tastes so good. She is also the biggest liar of all of our kids. They do not believe in their own mother.	338
144	https://www.labpatrika.com/2021/10/with-daughter-in-law.html	The daughter-in-law is more like her mom, in that she is a complete and utter fraud. She was born a year after her mother, and has never bothered to update her birth certificate, has spent as much time as she could on social media, and has never had a real job in her life. She only comes to church when its convenient, but still spends lots of money on herself.	339
144	https://www.labpatrika.com/2021/10/with-daughter-in-law.html	"The daughter-in-law is very different from her mother. She claims to be a vegetarian and uses the word ""vegan"" in every sentence, but she is secretly a vegetarian. She has a boyfriend named Scott and a huge collection of books about how to eat vegan. She has no idea how to cook, but she says she'd make a vegan meal in a heartbeat. She doesn't seem to realize that she is being tricked into believing that this meal is really for her to eat."	340
144	https://www.labpatrika.com/2021/10/with-daughter-in-law.html	"She claims to be a vegetarian, but she is a complete hypocrite. She is not a vegan and she is not a vegetarian, she is a vegetarian who pretends to be in between. She is also VERY proud of what she calls her ""vegan lifestyle,"" which consists of a lot of diet heavy on cheese, but she claims that she isn't eating any dairy."	341
144	https://www.labpatrika.com/2021/10/with-daughter-in-law.html	"There are several things that Daughter in law is not, which is why she is such a hypocrite. She is not vegan, she is not vegetarian, she is not vegan and she is definitely not vegetarian. She has a weird belief system, and it is NOT vegan. She also uses the term ""vegan"" as though it means the same thing as ""vegetarian"" or ""vegan"" as in vegan. She is definitely NOT a vegan. She is also NOT a vegetarian."	342
144	https://www.labpatrika.com/2021/10/with-daughter-in-law.html	The daughter-in-law claims to be a vegan, and this is in no way true. She is a vegetarian, but she does not believe in the Vegan lifestyle or anything that can be loosely called a vegan lifestyle. She also says that she is not eating dairy (which she also claims to not eat), but it's a lie because she is a vegan.	343
145	https://www.mhtlegal.com/blog/2020/october/simple-steps-to-building-a-strong-estate-plan/	Georgia adults of all ages can benefit from considering what they want in the future, both for themselves and their loved ones. Building a strong estate plan starts with reviewing objectives and long-term goals, determining what should happen to assets and property after passing. With a few simple steps, it is possible to craft a plan that will make sense for years to come and provide peace of mind.	344
145	https://www.mhtlegal.com/blog/2020/october/simple-steps-to-building-a-strong-estate-plan/	Estate planning is the process of deciding what will happen to assets, but it can also involve much more than that. There are tools that allow an individual to outline medical preferences, name a person to act on his or her behalf in case of incapacitation, set aside assets for specific future use, and more. One of the first steps in this is to inventory all assets and property that will need to be addressed in an estate plan.	345
145	https://www.mhtlegal.com/blog/2020/october/simple-steps-to-building-a-strong-estate-plan/	After taking inventory of assets, it will then be necessary to take an inventory of the needs of all beneficiaries and loved ones. This may include naming a guardian for minor children, updating beneficiaries on life insurance policies, or establishing a trust to pass assets to a loved one in the future. This means considering needs that are important now, as well as those that could be important well into the future.	346

148	https://www.projektwww.com/the-risks-of-winning-a-lottery/	Lotteries are popular forms of gambling that encourage people to pay a small sum of money to be in with a chance of winning a big jackpot–often administered by state or federal governments. While winning a lottery is not a guarantee of wealth, it can provide significant financial benefits for those who are lucky enough to win.	349
148	https://www.projektwww.com/the-risks-of-winning-a-lottery/	Often, lottery winners will receive large amounts of cash and other prizes. These prize funds can be a fixed amount of money or goods, or they can be distributed as a percentage of the total number of tickets sold. In either case, the organizer has a risk if not enough tickets are sold, but they can usually count on revenues and profits from these ticket sales to cover their costs.	350
148	https://www.projektwww.com/the-risks-of-winning-a-lottery/	Most major national lotteries offer a fixed number of prizes at regular intervals, and the frequency of drawings and the sizes of the prizes are determined by a series of rules. These rules typically require that the costs of organizing and promoting the lottery are deducted from the pool before any money is paid to winners, and that a portion of the remaining balance is available for the prize winners.	351
148	https://www.projektwww.com/the-risks-of-winning-a-lottery/	These lottery draws are based on a system of probability theory. The probabilities are calculated by multiplying a set of numbers by a mathematical formula known as a factorial.	352
148	https://www.projektwww.com/the-risks-of-winning-a-lottery/	The odds of a particular number combination are very low, but it is possible to improve your odds by using a variety of strategies. For example, you can choose a different pool of numbers or buy a higher-value ticket.	353
148	https://www.projektwww.com/the-risks-of-winning-a-lottery/	However, these strategies are unlikely to improve your chances of winning a huge jackpot, and they can lead to overspending. Some studies have found that people with lower incomes are more impulsive, and they may be tempted to spend an excessive amount of money on lottery tickets.	354
148	https://www.projektwww.com/the-risks-of-winning-a-lottery/	There are also cases where a lottery winner can become more poor than before they played, as their life situation becomes worse as a result of their unexpectedly large fortune. These problems have led to a growing concern about lottery games and their impact on individuals and families.	355
148	https://www.projektwww.com/the-risks-of-winning-a-lottery/	In addition to its popularity as a form of gambling, lottery draws are also widely used as a means of raising money for public projects. They are simple to organize, easy to play, and popular with the general public.	356
148	https://www.projektwww.com/the-risks-of-winning-a-lottery/	A lot of states enact laws that regulate lottery games, and each one is generally required to have a governing body that sets its rules and procedures. These bodies often select and license retailers, train their employees to use lottery terminals, sell tickets, and redeem winning tickets, and assist them in promoting the lottery game. They also pay high-tier prizes to players, and ensure that the retailers and the players comply with the lottery law and rules.	357
148	https://www.projektwww.com/the-risks-of-winning-a-lottery/	A lottery can be a useful way to raise money for public purposes, but it is not always the best choice for every project. For instance, in the United States, taxed lottery proceeds are sometimes spent on things like education and park services rather than on the construction of public buildings. Moreover, because of the high cost involved in playing the lottery, many people feel that their money could be better spent elsewhere.	358

161	http://denboig.org/	The Barony of Denboig (alias's Dunbog and Dunboig) is a Scottish feudal barony Parish in the county of Fife in Scotland. In the medieval period the church and parish of Dunbog originally belonged to the Abbey of Arbroath in Angus. Arbroath or Aberbrothock Abbey was initially a Cluniac Priory founded by King William the Lion in 1178, later, around 1233, it was taken over by Tironsian monks from Kelso Abbey. Arbroath Abbey is famed as the site of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1320. Within the parish of Dunbog stood the Cistercian Priory of Cadvan, a cell of nearby Balmerino Abbey. Balmerino Abbey which lies on the shores of the River Tay, across from Dundee, was founded as a Cistercian house by the widow of King William the Lion in 1236. The only building of historical significance in modern Dunbog is Dunbog Mansion house which is built on the site of Cadvan Priory. At one point it was occupied by Cardinal David Beaton [born 1494- died 1546].	371
161	http://denboig.org/	From the start of the sixteenth century until the mid-seventeenth century Dunbog was associated with the Beatons or Bethunes both septs of Clan Maclean, the Bethunes are also a family of Norman origin derived from a town of that name in Pas de Calais, France. The Beatons held lands in Fife, Angus, and elsewhere in Scotland, including Dunbog. On 2 July 1504 King James IV confirmed the sale of the lands of Dunbog and Contrahills, in the barony of Ballinbreich, to David Beaton of Creich. This was confirmed on 22 November 1510, when James IV granted John Beaton and his heirs, the lands of Dunbog and Contrahills lying within the barony of Ballinbreich. A few years later, on 31 December 1516, Alexander, Lord Home, sold the lands of Dunbog in the barony of Ballinbreich, Fife, to David Beaton of Creich and his heirs. On 1 February 1530 King James V confirmed a charter granted by Robert, Abbot of Balmerino, and Master Andrew Gagie of Gaduan an annex of the said abbey, of the lands and town of Johnston lying between the lands of Balmaddy and Dunbog to John Beaton of Creich. The Beatons had secured their hold over the lands of Dunbog. David Beaton, Archbishop of St Andrews and Cardinal of Scotland, at one time resided at Dunbog. Beaton was assassinated at St Andrews in 1546 as a consequence of his ordering the execution, by burning at the stake, of George Wishart, the Protestant reformer.	372
161	http://denboig.org/	On 22 March 1687 the lands of Dunbog were granted to a George Bannerman. George Bannerman was an advocate and Chamberlain of the Lordship of Fife in 1687-1689 according to the Largo Manuscript (now in the National Archives of Scotland). George Bannerman of Dunbog died by 1691 leaving a widow Elizabeth Oliphant; by 1697 Elizabeth Oliphant, widow of George Bannerman of Dunbog, had married Major Henry Balfour of Starr – latterly ’of Dunbog’. Thus Dunbog fell into the hands of the Balfours a prominent family in Fife.	373
161	http://denboig.org/	John Balfour, 3rd Lord Balfour of Burleigh, was married in 1649 to Isabella, daughter of Sir William Balfour the Lieutenant of the Tower of London, Lord Balfour died by 27 Feb 1697. His third son was Major Henry Balfour who was granted the lands of Starr and others on 14 August 1691 and later he was granted Dunboig and others on 27 July 1694. Henry Balfour of Dunbog, MP for Fife, participated in the Jacobite Rising of 1715. He had previously served as a Major in the Dragoons and may have had a similar position in the Jacobite Army. There were two major battles during the ’15, one at Sheriffmuir near Stirling which ended in a stalemate and the other the Siege of Preston in Lancashire where the Jacobites were surrounded by Government forces and eventually surrendered. The Jacobite Army in Preston was composed of men from the North of England supported by a contingent of Scots, mainly Highlanders. Major Balfour presumably had escaped from Preston as he was captured at Carlisle. As Balfour had committed an act of rebellion his lands including Dunbog were forfeit to the Crown.	374
161	http://denboig.org/	Henry Balfour of Dunbog had married Katherine Porterfield and they had a number of children, including David, Henry, and Robert. Although Major Balfour had been a rebel and had his lands confiscated these were granted to his children in 1720 and 1728. Henry Balfour was served heir to his brothers Robert Balfour and David Balfour sons of Major Henry Balfour of Denboig, on 4 July 1730. Henry Balfour had inherited the lands and title of Dunbog, and he in turn was succeeded by his son Henry as on 11 September 1765, Henry Balfour of Dunbog was served heir to his father Henry Balfour of Dunbog, and on 10 December 1765 he was granted a charter of Dunboig. This Henry Balfour sold Dunboig to the family of Dundas in 1766. Possibly the most famous member of the Balfour family was Major General Nisbet Balfour of Dunbog (1743-1823) who fought in the American war of Independence and in the Napoleonic Wars.	375
161	http://denboig.org/	Thomas Dundas of Fingask, Perthshire, and his wife Bethia Baillie, daughter of John Baillie of Castlecary, Stirlingshire, had two sons namely Thomas Dundas of Fingask and Carron Hall, and Lawrence Dundas of Kerse.

By the time the building was remodelled and enlarged in the 1880s, Blaenau Ffestiniog had grown to a population of 12,000 and was exporting 150,000 tons of slate per year across Europe, the USA and the British Empire.	407

The hall declined along with the slate industry in the twentieth century, and was used as a factory before being mostly abandoned for the last forty years.	410
174	https://cadw.gov.wales/about-us/news/new-listed-buildings-old-market-hall-blaenau-ffestiniog	Now not only has the Old Market Hall become a grade II listed building, it is also within the Slate Landscape of Northwest Wales, which UNESCO inscribed in 2021 as the fourth Welsh entry on the World Heritage List.

188	https://midpointehotelorlando.com/how-to-win-the-lottery-online-3/	A common way to increase the odds of winning is to buy lottery tickets in a group. Syndicates are common, but they can also be formed with friends or family. Often, people use birthdays as a lucky number. Using this method, it is possible to limit the numbers you can select. However, the probability of winning depends on how much money you invest in the syndicate. Regardless, it is still worth your while to try.	445
188	https://midpointehotelorlando.com/how-to-win-the-lottery-online-3/	Besides the possibility of winning a huge jackpot, the lottery can be a fun way to get some thrills.

188	https://midpointehotelorlando.com/how-to-win-the-lottery-online-3/	The history of the lottery in the United States dates back to colonial times. During the French and Indian Wars, several colonies held lotteries to raise money for their troops. Many of these were private, but the Colonial Congress also used the games to raise money for its Colonial Army.	449
188	https://midpointehotelorlando.com/how-to-win-the-lottery-online-3/	During the early twentieth century, most forms of gambling were illegal in the U.S. Eventually, the federal government decided to regulate lotteries. Although some governments endorsed the lottery, others did not. One of the most notable cases was George Washington’s Mountain Road Lottery, which failed.	450
188	https://midpointehotelorlando.com/how-to-win-the-lottery-online-3/	Another notable case was the “Slave Lottery” of Col. Bernard Moore in 1769. Unlike other lotteries of the time, this one advertised land as a prize.	451

In fact, there are newspaper ads from the colonial era that show that there were hundreds of lotteries in operation. The first state-level lottery was in New Hampshire, which introduced it in 1964. Today, there are 45 states and the District of Columbia that operate their own lotteries. In addition to the states, the US Virgin Islands will introduce a lottery in 2021.	454
189	https://preclickbid.com/what-is-online-lottery/	The US states that participate in the lottery direct part of the revenue to state organizations, charities, and programs. For example, the Illinois Lottery allocates a quarter of its revenue to in-state schools and charities. The top prize can be as much as $300,000! Many lottery companies offer mobile apps.

189	https://preclickbid.com/what-is-online-lottery/	While the New Hampshire Lottery attempts to ensure the accuracy of information posted on its website, the lottery has no responsibility for the accuracy of the translations. In addition, the lottery does not guarantee the results on its website. In the event of a discrepancy, the official results shall prevail. Therefore, before reproducing, publishing, or displaying any content, it is wise to check the official lottery results.	458

193	https://thenationalopinion.com/TEN/compared-to-murmu-ive-done-a-lot-more-for-the-tribals-and-im-happy-of-my-bjp-record-yashwant-singh-sinha/	Yashwant Sinha, the opposition candidate for president, said Thursday that he had done “far more” for Scheduled Tribes and other disadvantaged populations than his NDA challenger Droupadi Murmu, who served as governor of Jharkhand. Sinha said he was “proud” of his record as a member of the BJP headed by former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, despite misgivings in certain quarters about the opposition’s support for him.	477
193	https://thenationalopinion.com/TEN/compared-to-murmu-ive-done-a-lot-more-for-the-tribals-and-im-happy-of-my-bjp-record-yashwant-singh-sinha/	Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party, he said, is “unrecognisable” from the one headed by former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. PTI quoted Sinha (84) as saying that the current presidential race is not a struggle of identity, but rather one of ideas.	478

But what has she accomplished? She served as the governor of the state of Jharkhand. Was she successful in making a difference in the lives of the indigenous people? Just because you were born into a specific group doesn’t mean you’re inherently its champion.“	479

The Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and women were all given particular consideration in every budget. In the government where I was employed, it was the official policy. If it weren’t for the fact that I was not born into a tribal family, I could make the case that I have done more for underserved groups than she has.” He said that the BJP relies on identity politics, whilst the opposition uses ideology to make its point.	480

This is only the beginning. In the next few days and weeks, “things will change,” he said, adding that he intends to meet with representatives of every political party after submitting his candidacy papers on June 27.	481

In the beginning of our campaign, the BJP did not have a majority. It’s time to enter. In the competition, “I’m in it, and I’m going to make sure we put up a nice show,” he added.	482

Executives can’t be controlled by someone who won’t say anything at Rashtrapati Bhawan because of that, he said.	483

One of India’s greatest parliamentarians and consensus builders was Atal Bihari Vajpayee. He would consult members of his own party as well as opposition parties on crucial topics, Sinha said, referring to the government’s policies on Iraq and Pakistan.	485
193	https://thenationalopinion.com/TEN/compared-to-murmu-ive-done-a-lot-more-for-the-tribals-and-im-happy-of-my-bjp-record-yashwant-singh-sinha/	There is no such thing as unanimity in this (Modi’s) administration.” That BJP and current BJP are fundamentally different in this regard. He said that this BJP is unrecognisable. “Devaluation” of democratic institutions, especially the judiciary, has been blamed on the present administration, according to Sinha.	486

195	https://theymaybeparted.com/tag/joe-cocker/	It was only 100 hours before the Beatles would return to the studio together, and the charts on both sides of the Atlantic on December 29, 1968, were a perfect illustration of why there really wasn’t any rush for them to do so.	488
195	https://theymaybeparted.com/tag/joe-cocker/	That day, The Beatles (White Album) retained the top spot in the British charts for the fifth straight week in the midst of a run that would see the double LP at No. 1 for seven consecutive weeks and eight of nine. After a few weeks’ climb, it hit No. 1 in the United States a day earlier, on December 28, taking a much slower slog to the top. That climb vaulted the Beatles past Glen Campbell’s Wichita Lineman LP, the previous week’s No. 1 that was sunk to the runner-up position, and one of four records the country music star had in the top 30.	489
195	https://theymaybeparted.com/tag/joe-cocker/	The Beatles owned multiple shares in the Billboard album charts, too, with Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band (No. 63) and Magical Mystery Tour (85). The latter would provide the title track for Sergio Mendez’s Fool on the Hill LP that sat at No. 11 this week 48 years ago.	490
195	https://theymaybeparted.com/tag/joe-cocker/	Even with the White Album entrenched atop the British charts, there was plenty of Beatle-related materials moving off the shelves, with the Best of Cilla Black (No. 21) featuring four Lennon/McCartney credits and Jose Feliciano’s Feliciano! containing three Beatles covers and sitting one notch behind the Liverpudlian chanteuse (and higher at No. 7 in the U.S.).	491
195	https://theymaybeparted.com/tag/joe-cocker/	The first post-Christmas LP chart in the U.K. was predictably littered with greatest hits and other compilations, with about a dozen such records in the top 50. Four Simon & Garfunkel records were simultaneously on that chart, with a few soundtracks and two separate live LPs recorded at London’s Talk of the Town (Tom Jones and The Seekers).	492
195	https://theymaybeparted.com/tag/joe-cocker/	On the U.S. singles chart, Motown dominated with the label holding the top three spots: Marvin Gaye’s “I Heard it Through the Grapevine,” Stevie Wonder’s “For Once in My Life” and Diana Ross & The Supremes’ “Love Child.” While Beatles smash “Hey Jude” may have been fading, dropping to No. 15, “Hey Jude” the soulful Wilson Pickett cover was rising, hitting No. 43 on its way to eventually peaking at 23. That’s Duane Allman with the epic lead guitar part.	493
195	https://theymaybeparted.com/tag/joe-cocker/	Even though the Beatles didn’t release singles from their albums (a tradition scrapped in time for their final LPs, Abbey Road and Let It Be), their presence was made on the U.K. top 50 without charting a single song of their own (”Hey Jude” dropped out a week earlier). Marmalade’s sugary cover of “Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da” stood at No. 7 en route to the top spot the following week, while the Bedrock’s more authentically Caribbean-sounding version of the same song was at No. 30. That cover, produced by former Beatles engineer Norman Smith, would peak 10 notches higher a week later. On its way down the charts was Joe Cocker’s cover of “With a Little Help From My Friends,” dropping to No. 39 on its last week on the charts it had topped about six weeks earlier.	494
195	https://theymaybeparted.com/tag/joe-cocker/	Apple Records artist Mary Hopkin fell to No. 24 in the U.K. with former No. 1 hit “Those Were the Days,” as produced by Paul McCartney (it was at No. 25 in the U.S., down from it’s peak at No. 2).	495
195	https://theymaybeparted.com/tag/joe-cocker/	What held the top spot in the British charts? It was a song written by McCartney, but not that one. Mike McCartney, Paul’s brother under his stage name Mike McGear, wrote “Lily the Pink” with fellow Scaffold members Roger McGough and John Gorman. The song remained at No. 1 for a second consecutive week, part of a run that saw the comedy folk song reign atop the charts for four of five weeks. “Lily the Pink” had no shortage of future and contemporary star power: Elton John, Graham Nash and Tim Rice provided backup vocals, while Cream’s Jack Bruce laid down the bass line.	496
195	https://theymaybeparted.com/tag/joe-cocker/	The Beatles wouldn’t be absent from the British charts for too long. Exactly five months after December 29, 1968, “Get Back” — which Paul developed out of a jam on January 7, 1969, and was written in the studio throughout the month during the sessions that would bear its name — would debut at No. 1 in the U.K.	497

204	https://www.globalgreyebooks.com/life-and-adventures-of-martin-chuzzlewit-ebook.html	Originally published in 1844, Charles Dickens thought 'The Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit' to be his best work, even though it was one of his least popular novels. A tale of greed and selfishness, it tells the story of Martin Chuzzlewit, who goes to work for the architect, Seth Pecksniff; an odious man who uses the money of his students without really teaching them anything. There's also Tom Pinch, an innocent and kind hearted man who was fallen foul of Pecksniff's greed. The backdrop to all this is the relationship young Martin wishes to have with Mary Graham - a relationship which his grandfather is seemingly against.	513

206	https://www.hatcherfinancial.com/resource-center/investment/the-anatomy-of-an-index	The S&P 500 is ubiquitous – we see it on the news, read about it in the newspapers, and very likely, see some of our own investments' performance compared against it. For an index that represents approximately 80% of the value of the U.S. equity market, it may be worthwhile to gain a better understanding of how it works.1	518
206	https://www.hatcherfinancial.com/resource-center/investment/the-anatomy-of-an-index	The index, as we know it today, was introduced in 1957 and is maintained by the Standard & Poor's Index Committee. Contrary to popular belief, it is not comprised of the 500 largest companies in America, but is a collection of large-cap stocks representing a broad range of market sectors, including technology, energy, health care, and consumer staples, among others.3	519
206	https://www.hatcherfinancial.com/resource-center/investment/the-anatomy-of-an-index	There are a number of criteria a company must meet to be considered for inclusion in the index. Some of these criteria include the following: it must be a U.S. company, have an unadjusted market capitalization of $14.6 billion or more, have 50% of its stock available to the public, and have four consecutive quarters of positive earnings.3	520
206	https://www.hatcherfinancial.com/resource-center/investment/the-anatomy-of-an-index	Another common misconception is that the index is a static one. In fact, companies will be removed, from time to time, for reasons that include violation of one or more of the criteria used for adding companies or because of a merger, acquisition, or significant restructuring, including bankruptcy.	521
206	https://www.hatcherfinancial.com/resource-center/investment/the-anatomy-of-an-index	The turnover in the index's constituent companies was 3.6% in 2020 (per the most recent data available). According to one projection, the average tenure of companies in the index is expected to fall to 15-20 years this decade, as compared to the 30-35 year average tenure in the late 1970s.4	522
206	https://www.hatcherfinancial.com/resource-center/investment/the-anatomy-of-an-index	When changes are made to the index, many mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that seek to replicate the index may have to sell stocks that are being removed and buy the stocks that are being added in order to track the index. Keep in mind that amounts in mutual funds and ETFs are subject to fluctuation in value and market risk. Shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.5	523
206	https://www.hatcherfinancial.com/resource-center/investment/the-anatomy-of-an-index	Investors cannot invest in an index. Also, index performance is not indicative of the past performance of a particular investment, and past performance does not guarantee future results.

Its positive attitude and creative confidence makes Brisbane a genuine new-world city. Even though the city is rapidly developing and forward-thinking, it maintains a youthful enthusiasm and has what is arguably the most vibrant, laid back and friendliest atmosphere of any east-coast capital city. It is also an energetic river town on the way up, with an edgy arts scene, pumping nightlife, and great coffee and restaurants!	538

211	https://www.mhtlegal.com/blog/2021/february/do-you-need-a-living-will-/	Thinking about death is not always easy, especially when one is still relatively young and in good health. However, planning for what happens at the end of one’s life is just as important as planning for what happens after. This is why a complete estate plan should always include a living will.	545
211	https://www.mhtlegal.com/blog/2021/february/do-you-need-a-living-will-/	A living will allows a person to document his or her wishes for end-of-life care. Georgians often use this document to detail which treatments they are comfortable with, and which treatments they would like to avoid. Some of the more commonly addressed treatments are those that are used to extend life, such as:	546
211	https://www.mhtlegal.com/blog/2021/february/do-you-need-a-living-will-/	It is not enough to simply assume that a spouse, child or loved one will be permitted to make decisions should one become incapacitated. This is why a health care power of attorney usually accompanies a living will. This document gives a designated person the legal right to make medical decisions on another’s behalf. He or she should also have access to the living will.	547
211	https://www.mhtlegal.com/blog/2021/february/do-you-need-a-living-will-/	Everyone in Georgia deserves to have the best possible end of life care that corresponds with their wishes. One of the most effective ways to make sure that one’s wishes are truly upheld and respected is to create a living will and assign a trustworthy health care power of attorney. This is only one small step in the estate planning process though, so it may be worthwhile to explore what other options are available.	548

His second wife Maryan died in 2015 and was buried at the cemetery. The gravestone they will share has stood at Arlington, inscribed with both their names, since then.

Most of the justices were eligible to be buried at Arlington because they met the cemetery's military service requirement, but others were given special permission to be buried there. Funeral plans have not yet been announced, but Stevens is expected to be the 13th Supreme Court justice to be buried at the cemetery. During his nearly 35 years on the court, he served with six other justices buried there.	563

Rehnquist. Rehnquist was the last justice to be buried at the cemetery, in 2005. Martin Ginsburg, the husband of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, was buried in the cemetery in 2010, near where Stevens will be interred. The justice has kept the framed, folded flag from her husband's casket in her office at the court ever since.	564

Kennedy, with its iconic eternal flame. Standing near where Stevens will be buried, visitors can see the Lincoln Memorial and Washington Monument in the distance. The justices buried in the section are all fairly close together. Four of the men Stevens served with have adjoining plots, their headstones in a row: Harry Blackmun, Thurgood Marshall, Potter Stewart and William J. Brennan Jr. The four served together on the high court between 1970 and 1981. The man who was chief justice when Stevens joined the court in 1975, Burger, is buried one row in front of them, in the same row as Stevens' gravestone."	566

Instead, the stones are more personal. Blackmun, the author of the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade abortion decision, has his stone inscribed: ""Humility (asterisk) Integrity (asterisk) Compassion (asterisk) Courage."" Marshall, who argued the landmark Brown v. Board of Education school desegregation case and became the court's first black justice when he joined the bench in 1967, has his engraved ""Civil Rights Advocate."" Stewart's stone says: ""A good lawyer who did his best."" And Brennan shares a tombstone with his first and second wives, the latter his longtime secretary."	567

229	http://www.biriz.net/what-is-naval-radome-volo-radome-4109.html	A marine radome is a protective cover or enclosure that houses and protects a marine radar antenna on a ship or boat. The word “radome” comes from the combination of “radar” and “dome” because the radome typically has a dome-like shape.	590
229	http://www.biriz.net/what-is-naval-radome-volo-radome-4109.html	The radome is made of materials that are transparent to the radar waves emitted by the antenna. This allows the radar signals to pass through the radome and be transmitted and received by the antenna without interference or distortion. The radome also protects the antenna from the harsh marine environment, including saltwater, wind, and other weather conditions.	591

231	https://1960sdaysofrage.wordpress.com/2019/02/13/susan-brownmiller/	“Susan Brownmiller (born February 15, 1935) is an American feminist journalist, author, and activist best known for her 1975 book Against Our Will: Men, Women, and Rape. Brownmiller argues that rape had been previously defined by men rather than women, and that men use it as a means of perpetuating male dominance by keeping all women in a state of fear. … Brownmiller’s path into journalism began with an editorial position at a ‘confession magazine’. She went on to work as an assistant to the managing editor at Coronet (1959–60), as an editor of the Albany Report, a weekly review of the New York State legislature (1961–1962), and as a national affairs researcher at Newsweek (1963–1964). In the mid-1960s, Brownmiller continued her career in journalism with positions as a reporter for NBC-TV in Philadelphia (1965), staff writer for The Village Voice (1965), and as a network news writer for ABC-TV in New York City (1966–68). Beginning in 1968, she worked as a freelance writer; her book reviews, essays, and articles appeared regularly in publications including The New York Times, Newsday, The New York Daily News, Vogue, and The Nation. In 1968, she signed the ‘Writers and Editors War Tax Protest‘ pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War. Brownmiller volunteered for Freedom Summer in 1964, wherein she worked on voter registration in Meridian, Mississippi. … Returning to New York, she began writing for The Village Voice and became a network TV newswriter at the American Broadcasting Company, a job she held until 1968. She continues to write and speak on feminist issues, including a recent memoir and history of Second Wave radical feminism. … Against Our Will was a highly controversial book. Brownmiller’s basic premise was contested by some sections of the left wing, who considered it untrue that ‘all men benefit’ from the culture of rape, and who believed rather that it was possible to organize both women and men together to oppose sexual violence. The book also received criticism from Angela Davis, who thought Brownmiller disregarded the part that black women played in the anti-lynching movement and that Brownmiller’s discussion of rape and race became an ‘unthinking partnership which borders on racism’. In 1995, the New York Public Library selected Against Our Will as one of 100 most important books of the 20th century. …”	608

245	https://newsweekme.com/the-finest-table-games-unique-range/?amp=1	The best way to win at casino table games is to know the rules of the game and to have a strategy. There are many different strategies that you can use, but you need to find one that works for you. You also need to be able to read the other players at the table and to know when they are bluffing. One of the most important things to remember when you are playing table games is that you should never gamble with money that you cannot afford to lose. If you are not sure about a bet, then you should not make it. Remember that the house always has an edge, so you need to be careful.	659
245	https://newsweekme.com/the-finest-table-games-unique-range/?amp=1	Another thing to remember is that you should never pay more than you can afford to lose. This means that you should only bet on what you can afford to lose and not what you think you can win. If you bet more than you can afford to lose, then you are risking your entire bankroll. Finally, always remember to have fun when you are playing table games. Do not get too caught up in the game and forget to enjoy yourself. If you are not having fun, then you are not going to win. Play for the fun of it and not for the money.	660
245	https://newsweekme.com/the-finest-table-games-unique-range/?amp=1	There are many reasons why Blackjack is such a popular game in casinos. For one, it is a simple game to learn and play. Secondly, the house edge in Blackjack is quite low, making it a good game for players who want to win money. Finally, Blackjack is a very exciting game that can provide players with hours of entertainment. Blackjack is among the most popular casino table games. It is also known as twenty-one.	661
245	https://newsweekme.com/the-finest-table-games-unique-range/?amp=1	Blackjack is played with two decks of cards, with the player’s aim being to beat the dealer’s hand by having a higher total than the dealer. In blackjack, the Ace is worth 1 point, the King is worth 10 points, the Queen is worth 9 points, and the Jack is worth 8 points. The other cards are worth their face value. The player can also use any combination of these values to make up their total. If the player goes over 21, they ‘bust’ and lose the game. The house edge in blackjack is quite low, making it a good game for players who want to win money. The house edge is the percentage of every bet that the casino expects to keep over the long run. For example, if the house edge is 5%, the meaning of this is that you can expect to lose $5 on average for each $100 you bet.	662
245	https://newsweekme.com/the-finest-table-games-unique-range/?amp=1	Poker is one of the most loved casino table games. It’s a fast-paced, exciting game that can be played by anyone.

The goal of this game is to make the best hand possible using your two cards and the 5 community cards combination.	663
245	https://newsweekme.com/the-finest-table-games-unique-range/?amp=1	Poker is a great game for both casual and serious players. It’s a great way to spend an evening with friends, and it can also be very lucrative. If you’re looking for a new game to play, poker is definitely worth checking out. Poker is a game of chance, but there is some skill involved. The better you are at reading people and predicting their actions, the better your chances will be of winning. Poker is also a great way to practice your bluffing skills. If you can convince your opponents that you have a better hand than you actually do, you’ll be able to take their money.	664
245	https://newsweekme.com/the-finest-table-games-unique-range/?amp=1	Baccarat is among the most popular casino table games. It’s easy to learn and play, and it offers some of the best odds in the casino. The game is also known for its high rollers, who often wager large sums of money on a single hand. The goal of this game is to bet on the hand that you think might score the highest total. The game is played with six decks of cards, and the player with the highest total wins. The dealer deals with two hands, one for the player and one for the banker. The player can bet on either hand, but the banker always has an edge. The player’s hand is the first to be dealt, and the banker’s hand is the second.	665
245	https://newsweekme.com/the-finest-table-games-unique-range/?amp=1	The player can either bet on the player’s hand, the banker’s hand, or tie. If the player bets on the player’s hand and it wins, the player gets back his original bet plus winnings equal to twice the amount of his original bet. If the player bets on the banker’s hand and it wins, the player gets back his original bet plus winnings equal to the amount of his original bet. If the player bets on a tie and it happens, the player gets back his original bet plus winnings equal to eight times the amount of his original bet. The game is over when one of the hands has a total of eight or nine.	666

263	https://www.nacogolf.com/what-does-mean-after-a-set/	The asterisk, or star, is a symbol found in many different contexts, and it’s often used to represent something that’s unknown or uncertain. When you see a star after a set, it’s an indication that the set isn’t complete and more information is needed. This is especially true in mathematics, science, and computer programming.	693
263	https://www.nacogolf.com/what-does-mean-after-a-set/	In mathematics, the asterisk is usually used to indicate multiplication. For example, if you see the expression “2 * 3,” it means the same thing as “2 times 3.” This symbol is also used to indicate a mathematical set that isn’t complete. For instance, if you see the expression “A = {1, 2 *},” it indicates that the set A contains the elements 1 and 2, but there may be more elements that haven’t been listed.	694
263	https://www.nacogolf.com/what-does-mean-after-a-set/	In science, the asterisk is often used to denote the presence of an element that’s not normally present. For instance, if you see the word “oxygen*” on a chart, it means that oxygen is present, but there may be other elements present as well. It’s also used to indicate a scientific set that isn’t complete. For example, a set of animals may be represented by “Animals = {dog*, cat, mouse},” which indicates that there may be other types of animals in the set, but they haven’t been listed.	695
263	https://www.nacogolf.com/what-does-mean-after-a-set/	In computer programming, the asterisk is often used to represent a wildcard character. A wildcard character is a symbol that can match any character or set of characters. For example, if you see the expression “dir *.txt,” it means that the operating system should return all files that have a “.txt” extension. It’s also used in programming to indicate a set that isn’t complete. For instance, a set of colors may be represented by “Colors = {red*, green, blue},” which means that there may be other colors in the set, but they haven’t been listed.	696
263	https://www.nacogolf.com/what-does-mean-after-a-set/	In summary, when you see an asterisk after a set, it’s an indication that the set isn’t complete and more information is needed. The asterisk is used in many different contexts, including mathematics, science, and computer programming. In each of these contexts, the asterisk is used to indicate a set that isn’t complete and may contain additional elements.	697

263	https://www.nacogolf.com/what-does-mean-after-a-set/	The asterisk is also used in mathematical equations to indicate an unknown quantity. For example, if you see the equation “x * y = z,” it means that the value of x and y multiplied together equals z, but the value of x and y are unknown. This symbol is also used to denote a sequence of numbers. For instance, if you see the expression “1, 2*, 3, 4, 5,” it means that the sequence contains the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, but there may be additional numbers that haven’t been listed.	699
263	https://www.nacogolf.com/what-does-mean-after-a-set/	The asterisk is also used in science to indicate a range or an approximate value. For instance, if you see the expression “10*-20,” it means that the value is between 10 and 20, but the exact value isn’t known. This symbol is also used to denote an unknown quantity in a chemical equation. For example, if you see the equation “A + B = C*,” it means that the value of C is unknown.	700

In accordance with this provision, I have sent the enclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication, stating that the emergency declared with respect to grave acts of violence committed by foreign terrorists that disrupt the Middle East peace process, is to continue in effect beyond January 23, 1997.

Terrorist groups continue to engage in activities with the purpose or effect of threatening the Middle East peace process, and which are hostile to U.S. interests in the region. Such actions threaten vital interests of the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. For these reasons, I have determined that it is necessary to maintain in force the broad authorities necessary to deny any financial support from the United States for foreign terrorists that threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace process.	710

297	https://feminist.org/news/era-unfpa-legislation-introduced-in-congress-2/	Along with 186 cosponsors, Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) introduced the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) into the 108th Congress yesterday. With the goal of having a vote on the legislation sometime this year, Maloney introduced the ERA in order to launch a renewed effort to secure equal rights for women under the Constitution.	755
297	https://feminist.org/news/era-unfpa-legislation-introduced-in-congress-2/	“The ERA is gaining momentum, and 2003 should be its year to come of age. Most Americans believe that the Constitution already makes it clear that men and women are entitled to equal rights, and when they learn it does not, nine out of ten Americans believe it should,” said Congresswoman Maloney in a statement.	756
297	https://feminist.org/news/era-unfpa-legislation-introduced-in-congress-2/	The ERA, written by women’s rights pioneer Alice Paul, was introduced in every session of Congress from 1923 until it was approved in 1972. However, in order for the ERA to become the 28th Amendment to the US Constitution it had to then be ratified by 38 states with a ten-year deadline. Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority, led the drive to ratify the ERA from 1972-1982. The ERA was ratified in 35 states, just three states short.	757
297	https://feminist.org/news/era-unfpa-legislation-introduced-in-congress-2/	“We must keep introducing the ERA until women win equality,” Smeal said. “As the Bush administration continues to turn back the clock on women’s rights, the ERA is needed now more than ever. Without a constitutional guarantee, the progress women have made over the past 30 years is endangered.”	758
297	https://feminist.org/news/era-unfpa-legislation-introduced-in-congress-2/	Rep. Maloney’s move to reintroduce the ERA was preceded last week with another bold step forward. On the eve of International Women’s Day, Maloney and Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA) announced legislation that would appropriate $134 million – $50 million for 2003 and $84 million for 2004 – to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).	759
297	https://feminist.org/news/era-unfpa-legislation-introduced-in-congress-2/	Last year, President Bush withdrew $34 million in funds for UNFPA, despite Secretary of State Colin Powell’s earlier endorsement of the agency’s “invaluable work.” The result cut 13 percent of funding for the UNFPA’s international family planning programs, which would have enabled the UNFPA to prevent two million unwanted pregnancies, 4,700 maternal deaths, nearly 60,000 cases of maternal illnesses and over 77,000 cases of infant and child death.	760

304	https://integrity-legal.com/legal-blog/tag/united-nations-general-assembly/	It appears that Thailand has thrown its “hat into the ring” in the campaign for a seat on the United Nations Security Council. In a recent press release from Thailand’s Government Public Relations Department:	772
304	https://integrity-legal.com/legal-blog/tag/united-nations-general-assembly/	Thailand has submitted its candidature for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) for the term 2017-2018. The Thai government has also announced the official launch of Thailand’s campaign for UNSC, with the elections scheduled for October 2016, during the 71st session of the United Nations General Assembly.	773
304	https://integrity-legal.com/legal-blog/tag/united-nations-general-assembly/	Thai officials appear confident that Thailand would be well suited to the duties and responsibilities inherent in a non-permanent appointment to the United Nations Security Council. Thailand has always maintained the position that diplomacy can act as a deterrent to international conflict. Furthermore, Thailand has played an integral part in various United Nations operations:	774
304	https://integrity-legal.com/legal-blog/tag/united-nations-general-assembly/	Thailand has always answered UNSC’s call for collective action in UN peace missions around the world. Since 1950, Thailand has deployed over 20,000 military and police personnel in over 20 UN peacekeeping and related missions worldwide. Just recently, Thailand has for the first time sent its policewomen to participate in the UN Mission in Liberia.	775
304	https://integrity-legal.com/legal-blog/tag/united-nations-general-assembly/	As noted above, Thailand’s role in international peacekeeping initiatives cannot be overstated. Meanwhile, Thailand has continued to maintain a deep commitment to promoting human rights in an international context. At the same time, Thailand and Thai officials have implemented policies to promote not only security, but peaceful solutions to potentially contentious international issues. All of this being stated, it has been quite some time since Thailand has held a position on the UN Security Council notwithstanding the fact that the Kingdom of Thailand has played a key role in many UN projects and programs.	776
304	https://integrity-legal.com/legal-blog/tag/united-nations-general-assembly/	Thailand served as President of the General Assembly in 1956 and served once as a non-permanent member of UNSC in 1985-1986. It was elected to the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) for the term 2010-2013 during which it served as President between 2010 and 2011. Thailand has subsequently submitted its HRC candidature for a second term in 2015-2017.	777
304	https://integrity-legal.com/legal-blog/tag/united-nations-general-assembly/	As Thailand has recently been intimately involved with human rights issues as a member of the UNHRC it stands to reason that Thailand may be well equipped for a seat on the Security Council as the matters discussed and policies promulgated by the UNSC can have a tremendous impact on many nations and individuals around the world. Those monitoring this issue can only speculate as to the outcome of Thailand’s decision to seek a Security Council position, but there seem to be logical arguments in favor of placing Thailand in such an important role.	778

305	https://islamiccouncilonscouting.com/understanding-the-impact-of-online-gambling/	Gambling is a universal human activity that involves a gambler betting against others in an effort to win something of value. This activity is a result of a combination of skill and chance and can take many forms. For instance, there are games such as blackjack, poker, and slots. Some gambling sites also offer bingo, raffles, tip boards, and pull-tabs.	780
305	https://islamiccouncilonscouting.com/understanding-the-impact-of-online-gambling/	Internet gambling has the potential to improve consumer protection and generate revenue for local and state governments. However, it also has the potential to increase the risk of problems. Online casinos may target high-risk gamblers, and rogue operators may find ways to operate outside of the law. Therefore, there is a need for strong regulations that require all operators to enact strategies to protect customers.	781
305	https://islamiccouncilonscouting.com/understanding-the-impact-of-online-gambling/	In order to understand the impact of internet gambling on gamblers, researchers must look at the various factors that influence this behaviour. These factors include game-specific characteristics and the Internet’s unique capabilities. Using algorithms and other computer-based methods, regulators can identify indications of gambling problems in a way that is specific to the online environment.	782
305	https://islamiccouncilonscouting.com/understanding-the-impact-of-online-gambling/	For example, a study by LaPlante DA and colleagues in the Journal of Psychopathology suggests that there is a relationship between the degree of involvement in a gambling activity and the risk of problem gambling. The researchers developed an index that calculates the extent of involvement in a gambling activity. They found that the more involved a gambler was, the more likely they were to engage in a given activity. But this is not a reliable indicator of whether or not a gambler will develop a problem.	783
305	https://islamiccouncilonscouting.com/understanding-the-impact-of-online-gambling/	Another study by Temporin M. and Boschetti A. investigated the possibility of unsustainable gambling. Researchers used a single dataset from a European gambling site. Unlike the above study, this study looked at the extent to which participants engaged in the above-mentioned “momentary” and “serious” activities. Their results suggest that while there is a strong link between gambling activity and a broader sense of involvement, there is little to no evidence that one single indicator is adequate to predict a gambler’s problem.	784
305	https://islamiccouncilonscouting.com/understanding-the-impact-of-online-gambling/	In order to achieve this, it is critical to understand the various aspects of gambling and to conduct longitudinal studies to measure how gambling is likely to affect its users. To do so, it is important to analyze a wide range of player accounts. There are a number of factors that can influence the probability of problem gambling, including the amount of money a gambler is spending, the type of game they are playing, and the nature of the gaming experience.	785
305	https://islamiccouncilonscouting.com/understanding-the-impact-of-online-gambling/	Similarly, it is important to examine the impact of online gambling on gamblers’ decision making. This is especially important to determine whether the gambling medium is a good way to detect problematic gaming. Several states, including New Jersey, have begun to legalize and regulate Internet gambling.	786
305	https://islamiccouncilonscouting.com/understanding-the-impact-of-online-gambling/	As a result of this, the online gambling industry is maturing. While it is certainly not perfect, the industry has improved dramatically since its introduction. Casinos are now better equipped to recognize and combat problematic gaming practices. Additionally, the regulation of the Internet is now under the jurisdiction of the legislature, rather than being left to the regulatory whims of a shady operator.	787

Of the international students, the countries with the most representatives are the U.S. (11%), Brazil (6%), India (6%), and China (5%). There has also been a 40% increase in German students on the program, who now account for 4% of the class.	802
311	https://mediaroom.iese.edu/category/uncategorized-en/	But nationality is not the only way in which the Class of 2019 is diverse. While many students come from backgrounds in consulting and banking, the number of students from non-traditional industries such as social media, e-commerce and IT has also grown to 24%. The number of women in the program is also growing, with women now making up 32% of the class.	803
311	https://mediaroom.iese.edu/category/uncategorized-en/	The participants have an average of five years of professional experience and commit full-time to the program, which is taught in English, for 19 months, on the Barcelona campus.	804
311	https://mediaroom.iese.edu/category/uncategorized-en/	The 2017-18 academic year is the first time ever that both first- and second-year classes have five sections of students. The fifth section of the MBA was incorporated last year due to the 28% increase in the number of applications received since 2010. The rise in quality applications is largely thanks to the positive global positioning of the program in rankings and the increased presence of IESE around the world with its different campuses (Barcelona, Madrid, New York, Munich and Sao Paulo).	805
311	https://mediaroom.iese.edu/category/uncategorized-en/	The IESE MBA program was founded in 1964 and was the first two-year MBA program taught in Europe and the first in Spain.

313	https://nativeandvogue.com/2023/03/02/the-symbolic-power-of-native-clothing-how-it-connects-generations/	When it comes to fashion, Native clothing is often seen as a symbol of culture and tradition. Native clothing is more than just a style choice; it is a way for Native people to express their identity and connect to their heritage. Native culture has been passed down from generation to generation and its clothing is an important part of that legacy.	812
313	https://nativeandvogue.com/2023/03/02/the-symbolic-power-of-native-clothing-how-it-connects-generations/	Native clothing is often colorful, intricate, and unique, making it easily recognizable. It is also often made from traditional materials such as leather, feathers, and beads. The designs are typically inspired by nature, representing spiritual and cultural beliefs. As a result, wearing traditional clothing is a way for Native people to express their connection to the land and their ancestors.	813
313	https://nativeandvogue.com/2023/03/02/the-symbolic-power-of-native-clothing-how-it-connects-generations/	Native clothing is also used to show solidarity and unity among Native communities. It is a form of expression and a way to show pride in one’s heritage. For example, during protests and marches, many Native people wear traditional clothing to demonstrate their commitment to the cause.	814
313	https://nativeandvogue.com/2023/03/02/the-symbolic-power-of-native-clothing-how-it-connects-generations/	Native clothing is a powerful symbol of identity and culture, and can help to bridge the gap between generations. By wearing traditional clothing, younger generations can connect to their heritage and be reminded of the cultural values passed down from their ancestors. It can also serve as a reminder of the struggles that Native people have faced and the resilience that has been passed down through generations.	815

322	https://smashtv.org/automated-trading-bot-crypto/	Trading bots are automated software programs that work to financial markets in many ways, such as tracking prices in addition to placing buy and sell orders, and executing trades. They can be programmed to carry out a range of functions, from easy tasks like keeping track of the price of a single stock, to more complicated tasks like tracking multiple stocks and executing trades based on market conditions.	835
322	https://smashtv.org/automated-trading-bot-crypto/	One of the primary benefits of robots for trading is the fact that they are able to be programmed to perform difficult tasks with a great level of accuracy. For example, a bot can be programmed to monitor specific stocks and make trades in response to specific market conditions, like fluctuations in the stock’s price or volume. Additionally, trading bots can be programmed to analyse massive amounts of data and to make decisions based on that information, which helps in increasing the odds of trading profitably.	836

327	https://tbstemecula.org/event/erev-tisha-bav/	Tisha B’Av “the Ninth of Av,” is an annual fast day in Judaism, named for the ninth day (Tisha) of the month of Av in the Hebrew calendar. The fast commemorates the destruction of both the First Temple and Second Temple in Jerusalem, which occurred about 655 years apart, but on the same Hebrew calendar date. Tisha B’Av is never observed on Shabbat. If the 9th of Av falls on a Saturday, the fast is postponed until the 10th of Av.	853

330	https://tsam.net/orange-bat/	Batting is a game that was created in the 1800s, and most of us still get a kick out of it today. The game involves batting at a stationary target, but we’d be better off if we thought about it more. There are several different types of batting games, and the one I find the most interesting is the bat swing. In most games, you move an object from one place to another while swinging your bat.	855
330	https://tsam.net/orange-bat/	The bat swing is a very common type of batting game. It involves swinging a bat from side to side while hitting a stationary target. This is a very basic type of batting game. It’s not very challenging, but it can be fun.	856
330	https://tsam.net/orange-bat/	The bat swing, as you might imagine, is a very simple type of batting game. It is a simple game of moving an object from one place to another while swinging your bat. The bat swing is very commonly used in school and youth sports.	857
330	https://tsam.net/orange-bat/	In some ways, this game reminds me of the game of baseball called “ball-hurl.” Like with baseball, you start by swinging your bat from side to side and hitting a stationary target. But “ball-hurl” involves hitting a stationary target while also swinging your bat. The object of the game of “ball-hurl” is to hit the object, which is a stick, while also swinging your bat.	858
330	https://tsam.net/orange-bat/	It’s like being a football fan. You could always just be a baseball fan. But now you have to play a game that doesn’t involve a ball. But you also have to play a game that involves swinging your bat, and that’s basically the equivalent of a baseball game. And like a ball game, the object of the game is to hit the object. And you can’t just hit the object with the bat. You have to swing your bat.	859
330	https://tsam.net/orange-bat/	This is a problem because even though the object of the game is hitting the object (that is, the stick) and swinging at it, you’re still not actually playing the game. It’s like the game is still being played, but you arent playing the game.	860
330	https://tsam.net/orange-bat/	I don’t think its fair to call it a baseball game, but that’s the sort of thing that happens when you play an object-based game, and its sort of a problem. But because there are objects in the game that can be hit, and because some of them are bats, the game is still being played. This isn’t a very good analogy.	861
330	https://tsam.net/orange-bat/	I could see a situation in which a bat was used as a weapon. I know plenty of people in my life who play baseball. They are using the ball as a weapon and not really trying to hit anything. You will hear many players on TV and radio saying the same thing. I am sure many of the players on TV and radio would say the same thing if they saw a bat swing at them.	862
330	https://tsam.net/orange-bat/	If you are a baseball fan and you enjoy watching games, you will probably also enjoy watching movies. The only problem is that you will have to spend a lot of time watching it, and your mind will always be on the baseball game. The same thing would happen for the basketball game. The only way I would see it would be if you watched a basketball game.	863
330	https://tsam.net/orange-bat/	The reason why the baseball and basketball game are so popular is because they are both very fast-paced with one of the most exciting moments in sports. You have to constantly keep your eyes on the ball, but you don’t need to hit it. It becomes the focal point of the game’s play, and it is fun to watch.	864

333	https://ultrasatprep.com/ap-bio-unit-5-review/	Ap Bio Unit 5 review is a good book by an excellent author who takes the reader on a journey through a few of the topics that are covered in the book. In the end, the author provides a balanced view of what the book is going to get at and I will say that the book is not only a great read, but it also makes a great gift to anyone who wants to learn more about the subject of the book.	866
333	https://ultrasatprep.com/ap-bio-unit-5-review/	The book starts out by explaining the concept of a bio-electrician. It is important to remember that a bio-electrician is not just an engineer or scientist, but a scientist and engineer at the same time. These are the folks who are called bio-electricians because of their ability to harness the energy of animals in the form of electrical impulses.	867
333	https://ultrasatprep.com/ap-bio-unit-5-review/	They are people who have devoted their lives to a goal, and they know their job. The first bio-electricians were called natural electricians by their contemporaries because they could harness the energy of the sun. They had a more scientific approach to their work as bio-electricians. I think I have found my first bio-electrician, and I’m going to try to make him my next project.	868
333	https://ultrasatprep.com/ap-bio-unit-5-review/	ApBio is a company started by two bio-electricians, that has since expanded to become one of the top bio-electrician organizations. The company has a number of companies that work with their clients and are responsible for bio-electricians everywhere. Their main focus is the development of bio-electricians to help people with autism, epilepsy, mental illness, and other rare disorders. ApBio’s bio-electricians have special skills in the form of bio-electricity.	869
333	https://ultrasatprep.com/ap-bio-unit-5-review/	ApBio has one of the biggest bio-electrician companies in the world, so when you think about bio-electricians, you probably think about bio-electricians or bio-electricity. However, once you start reading the company’s bio-electrician profile, it’s hard to deny that they’re also bio-electricians. The bio-electricians in ApBio are also bio-electricians, so it makes you wonder what’s going on.	870
333	https://ultrasatprep.com/ap-bio-unit-5-review/	ApBio is the bio-electricians company founded by the late Paul B. Nenning. Thats right, the founder of the company was a bio-electrician. His bio-electrician company has an impressive list of clients and has been doing bio-electricity since the very beginning. He has a list of people to thank for his success, including the late Dr. Charles M. Leland, who was the first bio-electrician to ever receive a Nobel Prize.	871
333	https://ultrasatprep.com/ap-bio-unit-5-review/	Its interesting to see how Nenning was able to sell on the bio-electricity business. A lot of people are afraid of bio-electricity because a lot of it is made by viruses and some of those viruses are made to be very destructive.	872
333	https://ultrasatprep.com/ap-bio-unit-5-review/	This is why it seems as if ap bio-electricity is a multi-billion dollar company. Nenning is not afraid to put a lot of money into research in order to make bio-electricity. After all, a lot of that research is going into making bio-electricity that is safe and non-damaging. This is an area where Nenning seems to be very successful. The company’s website is filled with a lot of neat pictures and info about its products.	873
333	https://ultrasatprep.com/ap-bio-unit-5-review/	I have no problem with the ap bio-electricity company and all the research and research that is done on it. I just think that there are some people in the world who are very frightened to see bio-electricity being used in a very bad way.	874
333	https://ultrasatprep.com/ap-bio-unit-5-review/	It is a very bad way. I mean, it’s not entirely clear when it could be used to cause harm, but it is definitely dangerous. If a person were to use it to kill a person, that could easily turn into a very nasty accident. It is one of those things where people are using it to kill people and being scared of that.	875
334	https://ultrasatprep.com/look-game/	I recently got a new game from a friend of mine. He told me about it and I am very excited about it. The game is called look game which is a new game based on the concept of where you find yourself on a scale of 1 to 10. You are given a number, and you start at a place on the scale where you are not happy. You are given a number that you will attempt to reach by completing tasks.	876
334	https://ultrasatprep.com/look-game/	The game is simple, and I like the concept of reaching a point that you’re happy with. The game is designed to get you thinking about your own life, and to provide an outlet for the frustration you feel when you get stuck in a rut. The look game has been designed for ages by a British artist named Nicky Smith, and it seems to have an interesting, playful, and challenging way of putting things in perspective.	877
334	https://ultrasatprep.com/look-game/	As we said earlier, the game looks like a game with a lot of moving puzzles. I like the puzzles in the look game because it makes it feel like you’re still stuck in a weird, frustrating place.	878
334	https://ultrasatprep.com/look-game/	I don’t expect for you to be stuck in a puzzle, but I do expect that you will feel frustrated and angry. It’s not like there’s a great way to solve them. But you will be, because there isn’t anything else to do or do right. The game takes that frustration and turns it into something that you can work through in the future.	879
334	https://ultrasatprep.com/look-game/	I think the key to the puzzles is that they are very hard to solve because they are not really all that interesting when you think about them. If you were playing a game like Portal they would have a lot more interesting puzzles you could work through. But in this game, it makes it feel like youre stuck like in a puzzle to be solved.	880
334	https://ultrasatprep.com/look-game/	Well, as it turns out, a lot of the puzzles are not really hard puzzles at all. They actually have a lot of fun moments, like the one where you’re supposed to be in the bathroom and when you get there you see youve got to unlock a lock by pressing a lever, and you have to use the lever to open the lock. And when you do that, the water starts to pour out of the shower and you just have to avoid it.	881
334	https://ultrasatprep.com/look-game/	The water coming out of the shower is actually the game’s own water. It’s like its own game system, and the reason that’s so fun is because you can run around and play like you’re on water. But water isn’t really fun for anyone. It makes you thirsty and makes you want to play more, and the longer you stay wet, the less fun it becomes.	882
334	https://ultrasatprep.com/look-game/	This game is actually quite fun. If you want to play a game that makes you want to play more, and not want to play more, I would say this is the one. The water is part of the game that you can turn off, but you can’t turn it off for the whole game. You can turn it off for a few seconds, but that’s it. That’s a pretty small price difference though.	883
334	https://ultrasatprep.com/look-game/	It also seems like the game was made for a really short list of people who can’t play any other games. I can’t help but think that there is a certain type of gamer who needs to be able to play a game that is super-short and can barely do more than turn that off for an extended period of time. This game is not for them.	884
334	https://ultrasatprep.com/look-game/	This game is not a game that many people will ever play. It is probably because many people play games like Halo, Gears of War, and Bioshock Infinite, not because it is a game that most people never will. The list of games that it is not a game for is almost endless without any limit.	885
339	https://www.boundless.com/blog/roaring-20s/	The Roaring 20s may conjure up cosmopolitain images of flappers, speakeasies, art deco and jazz, but the 1920s were also a period of significant changes to U.S. immigration policy that would have repercussions for decades.	886
339	https://www.boundless.com/blog/roaring-20s/	The Immigration Act of 1924 (also known as the Johnson-Reed Act) established a strict quota system limiting immigration for each nationality to two percent of the total number of people of that nationality recorded in the 1890 U.S. Census (but excluding immigrants from Asia). The act replaced a previous, more generous quota system that admitted three percent of each nationality’s population in the 1910 census. The 1924 act’s quota was based on the national origins of the full U.S. population, not just those who were foreign-born, yielding a much-larger quota for immigrants from the British Isles and Western Europe. While the quota in place since 1921 had capped immigration at 350,000, the Johnson-Reed Act reduced the cap to just 165,000	887
339	https://www.boundless.com/blog/roaring-20s/	The 1924 act meant that even Asians previously allowed to immigrate, such as the Japanese, could no longer do so. It did not place quotas on Latin Americans. 1924 was also the year that the U.S. Border Patrol was established.	888
339	https://www.boundless.com/blog/roaring-20s/	The strengthened quotas had a chilling effect on immigration: in 1920 the foreign-born population of the U.S. stood at 13.2 percent. A decade later it had dropped to 11.6 percent. It shrank every decade until 1970, when it bottomed out at just 4.7 percent. The quota system remained in place until the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965.	889

352	https://www.miketooth.com/sleep-apnea	Using oral surgery to help sleep apnea seeks to remove the excess tissue in the throat that is vibrating and blocking the upper air passages. One surgical procedure is an Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP). This procedure involves removing the excess tissue from the upper mouth and throat. This procedure in performed in a hospital under general anesthesia. Maxillomandibular advancement is another type of procedure used to assist with sleep apnea. This procedure involves the upper and lower part of the jaw. In this procedure, the jaw is moved forward from the rest of the facial bones. This allows more room behind the soft palate, thereby reducing the obstruction. Finally a Tracheostomy is a last ditch effort when other treatments have failed. This involves the surgeon inserting a tube in your throat so you can breathe. It is covered during the day, but opens at night while you sleep. All of the aforementioned surgeries are routine and very safe.	912

360	https://www.rossfellercasey.com/newsletters/asbestos-litigation/	Asbestos is a naturally occurring fibrous material that has been used in building materials for many years, often for insulation. While nearly everyone in the United States has been exposed to asbestos at some time, many people who were exposed to asbestos over a long period of time have become ill. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, malignant pleural mesothelioma, a type of cancer that affects the inside lining of the chest cavity, is associated with asbestos exposure. Other effects of asbestos exposure can be a lung disease called asbestosis, build-up of scar tissue in the lung, pulmonary hypertension, and compromised immunity.	920
360	https://www.rossfellercasey.com/newsletters/asbestos-litigation/	It is estimated that more than 200,000 asbestos claims are pending in the U.S. courts. Over $70 billion has been spent in paying claims, attorney fees and other costs associated with asbestos claims, with remaining costs expected to reach up to $250 billion. Asbestos claimants range from those with debilitating effects of exposure to those with little or no medical consequences of exposure. There have been more than 8,000 defendants named in asbestos cases, ranging from manufacturers of asbestos to automakers, shipbuilders, textile mills, retailers, insurers, shipbuilders, electric utilities and other industries that have used asbestos. As asbestos manufacturers became bankrupt from paying claims, plaintiff attorneys sought out other defendants.	921
360	https://www.rossfellercasey.com/newsletters/asbestos-litigation/	Because asbestos litigation is based on the theory of strict liability, a plaintiff needs only to show exposure to asbestos and a resulting injury in order to succeed. However, because the great majority of asbestos cases are settled out of court, often plaintiffs are not required to prove any injury as a result of asbestos exposure. The American Bar Association committee on asbestos litigation is recommending a plan that imposes medical standards on the ability of plaintiffs to recover in asbestos cases. Under the proposed plan, plaintiffs (or their families) alleging non-malignant asbestos-related disease claims would be required to meet certain medical standards prior to filing suit in state or federal court. The plan would extend the statute of limitations so that taking time to qualify under the medical standards would not jeopardize plaintiffs’ claims. Congress is considering bills to adopt this plan. Plaintiff advocates and plaintiff attorneys are opposed to the proposal, arguing that it would deprive injured plaintiffs of their day in court. The U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly asked Congress to pass legislation to deal with the asbestos litigation problem.	922

374	https://yallnewyork.org/diy-kiln-pottery/	My family has been creating kiln pottery for years, but I’ve never made a kiln pottery before. The idea of kiln pottery is that you don’t have to be an artist to make it. In fact, it can be extremely easy to learn how to create it if you have the right materials. The most important thing to remember is that it is not something that you have to be an expert or even an expert on to do.	942
374	https://yallnewyork.org/diy-kiln-pottery/	Some people may think that the idea of making pottery is a bit of stretch. I think that is because of the image of a potter being someone who has a hobby that would be boring to them, but they may not think of the actual process that goes into creating it. I think it is far more common for people to think that pottery is something that you have to be an expert on, but that is not the case.	943
374	https://yallnewyork.org/diy-kiln-pottery/	I think that the majority of people who have been potters in the past would agree that there are two main ways to make pots: using clay and using a wheel or a lathe. For the sake of this article, I will assume that you are making pots using a wheel or lathe. To make a pot you need two pieces of clay, a handle, a bowl, and a mold.	944
374	https://yallnewyork.org/diy-kiln-pottery/	Clay is a substance made from a mixture of sand, water, and sometimes a couple of other liquids. It is an all-purpose medium. It can be used to make pretty much anything, from plates to bowls. For this article, I will assume that you are making pots using clay, since you have three pieces of clay, a handle and a bowl, and a mold.	945
374	https://yallnewyork.org/diy-kiln-pottery/	Clay is a pretty versatile material. It can be used to create pretty much anything you can think of. For the purposes of this article, I will assume that you are using clay.	946
374	https://yallnewyork.org/diy-kiln-pottery/	So I am going to assume that you are doing two things. You are either making a pot and are trying to make it look nice, or you are trying to make a pot and are trying to make it look pretty by using a mold. If you are making a pot, you are trying to use a mold to make it look nice. If you are making a pot, you are trying to use a mold to make it look pretty.	947
374	https://yallnewyork.org/diy-kiln-pottery/	It’s a great idea. The first problem is that most of the time, you are making a pot and then you aren’t using it for a long time. This can lead to problems like sagging, and when you use clay, there are many clay-related problems. For instance, when you are making a pot, you are making a mold. So to make the pot look nice, you have to use a mold.	948

382	https://bearcubcreations.com/the-history-of-lotteries/	Despite the negative image of gambling, attitudes toward lotteries began to change in the early twentieth century. After Prohibition failed to reduce alcohol consumption, casinos and gambling for charity became more popular in the United States, and more states began to allow lottery games. However, lingering concerns about fraud kept public opinion against lotteries in check for another two decades.	966
382	https://bearcubcreations.com/the-history-of-lotteries/	The tax on lottery winnings can vary greatly depending on where you live and how you cash out the prize. Depending on your state and how much you win, you could be taxed anywhere from 40 percent to 60 percent of your winnings. Even if you win small prizes in game shows or community raffles, you may be subject to hefty taxes.	967
382	https://bearcubcreations.com/the-history-of-lotteries/	Lotteries have a long history in the British Isles and Europe. They have been popular and often a source of public finance. In the United States, they are not as widespread, but they have a mixed history. They were introduced in the colonies by the British, and were subsequently denounced by religious campaigners. Some even petitioned state legislatures to ban lotteries, arguing that they were inherently evil.	968
382	https://bearcubcreations.com/the-history-of-lotteries/	The Irish lottery is a type of prize drawing that involves matching a series of numbers and symbols. Lotteries have been around for many centuries and are a popular form of government funding. Throughout history, lotteries have served many purposes including funding courthouses and public works. Although early lotteries did not generate significant revenues, they were an easy way for governments to raise money. They also attracted both participants and non-participants, including Catholics who tolerated gambling.	969
382	https://bearcubcreations.com/the-history-of-lotteries/	The odds of winning the lottery are based on mathematical probabilities. If you’ve ever played the lottery, you know how incredibly difficult it is to beat the odds. The odds of winning a single prize are much lower than your odds of winning the jackpot. However, if you’re a fan of being precise, you can calculate how to increase your chances of winning the lottery by using statistical calculations.	970
382	https://bearcubcreations.com/the-history-of-lotteries/	Although lotteries are considered to be a form of gambling, they are a legitimate form of betting. According to Professor Geesink, they are an acceptable form of betting, as long as they are used properly. For instance, during elections for office bearers, the proper use of a lot is important. Furthermore, taking risks in business is not necessarily wrong, but they should be proportionate to the line of business. When taking risks becomes an aim, however, it is regarded as gambling.	971
382	https://bearcubcreations.com/the-history-of-lotteries/	The lottery was first introduced in Colorado in 1890 and other states followed. Today, sales of lottery tickets amount to hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Many states use the money from lotteries to fund programs like pre-kindergarten. However, there are some negative consequences of playing the lottery.	972
383	https://bestmortgagemontreal.com/common-mortgage-terms-familiar-applying-one/	When applying for a mortgage for the first time, you will definitely end up having to deal with a few terms common to the mortgage industry. If you don’t have a background in finance or commerce, understanding such terms can be difficult the first time you come across them, which means that it will be difficult for you to know what the exact terms of the mortgage are. This also applies when getting debt consolidation mortgages in Montreal for the first time. Some of the common terms that you should be familiar with by the time you start shopping for a mortgage include:	973
383	https://bestmortgagemontreal.com/common-mortgage-terms-familiar-applying-one/	When shopping for a mortgage, you may come across some that are designated as Adjustable Rate Mortgages. This term refers to a mortgage that has a fixed interest rate for only a limited amount of time, such as 1, 3 or 5 years after you apply for and get the mortgage. After this, the interest rate will change based on various factors, the most important of which is an index that the mortgage company will explain to you when signing up for it.	974
383	https://bestmortgagemontreal.com/common-mortgage-terms-familiar-applying-one/	The rate adjustments will be done in intervals defined by the lender. This can be beneficial to you if the housing market fundamentals result in a reduction in the mortgage rates, since this means that you will end up paying progressively less over time. The mortgage will essentially cost you less than you had anticipated. However, it’s also important to remember that the rate can increase particularly in markets where the fundamentals indicate increased risk.	975
383	https://bestmortgagemontreal.com/common-mortgage-terms-familiar-applying-one/	The APR is one of the commonest terms associated with mortgages and other types of loans. It is a calculation that is used to determine the actual cost of the mortgage, i.e. the true interest rate that you will pay. The Annual Percentage Rate can either be fixed or adjustable depending on the terms of the mortgage. Each of these has its benefits and disadvantages.	976
383	https://bestmortgagemontreal.com/common-mortgage-terms-familiar-applying-one/	Amortization refers to the schedule that will be used to service the loan. When you get a mortgage, there may be other costs added onto it including interest which you will need to pay. When all these costs are calculated and the duration of payment taken into account, one can then calculate the amount you’ll need to pay per month in order to fulfil all your obligations. On the surface, this might seem simple, but the fact that there are so many variables to consider (depending on the type of mortgage you get) means that the calculation can be complicated. You may even need it to be done by the lender to ensure accuracy.	977
383	https://bestmortgagemontreal.com/common-mortgage-terms-familiar-applying-one/	When buying a home, you will need to pay the listed or negotiated price for the home, as well as extra charges which are usually lumped together as closing costs. These include attorney fees, recording fees and other costs. Such costs may be considered when applying for a mortgage.	978
383	https://bestmortgagemontreal.com/common-mortgage-terms-familiar-applying-one/	The commonest way of servicing a mortgage is by making a monthly payment for the duration of the mortgage. This translates to 12 payments over the year. However, one can also choose to make the payments every two weeks instead, by negotiating for a bi-weekly mortgage. You would end up paying half the monthly costs every two weeks, but would end up making 13 payments instead of 12 in a year. This reduces the amount of time needed to pay off the loan, and also reduces the interest due.	979
383	https://bestmortgagemontreal.com/common-mortgage-terms-familiar-applying-one/	These are just some of the common terms associated with mortgages that you need to understand. The key element to always keep in mind is making sure that any jargon you come across is explained to you as clearly as possible. The goal is to ensure that by the time you are signing the mortgage forms, you will know what to expect and understand the terms and conditions with a high degree of accuracy.	980
385	https://bulegacy.org/?pageID=3&storyNum=41	Ernestine O'Connell believed in blunt talk, quick action, and the power of a strongly worded letter. In 1996, she wrote to School of Management Dean Louis E. Lataif, former president of Ford Europe, asking to be put in touch with the highest-ranking Lincoln-Mercury official in North America. The problem? The air conditioner in her four-year-old Lincoln Town Car had failed.	981
385	https://bulegacy.org/?pageID=3&storyNum=41	"""She was most unhappy that her Lincoln air conditioner should fail and need replacing after four years, all at her expense,"" recalls Lataif (SMG'61, Hon.'90). ""So I asked Jim O'Connor, a former colleague and friend, who was then general manager of Ford's Lincoln-Mercury Division, to intercede. Having collected the evidence from Ms. O'Connell, he sent her an apologetic letter and a check for $1,171.94-the full cost of the repairs. She was thrilled."""	982
385	https://bulegacy.org/?pageID=3&storyNum=41	O'Connell (CAS'43, GRS'46, SED'58), who died in October 2009, demonstrated her gratitude and her enduring affection for the University in a characteristically dramatic way. She left $7.4 million to BU to greatly increase the endowment of the T. George and Ernestine O'Connell Memorial Scholarship, a fund her mother, Ernestine O'Connell (CAS'15), established in 1961. It is the largest gift to a scholarship fund in the University's history. The scholarship is awarded annually to juniors and seniors majoring in chemistry, geology, physics, biology, astronomy, or math and in need of financial assistance.	983
385	https://bulegacy.org/?pageID=3&storyNum=41	"""The O'Connell scholarships will help BU continue to attract and retain superb students in the sciences and mathematics,"" says Virginia Sapiro, dean of Arts & Sciences, ""and this will be true for generations to come."""	984
385	https://bulegacy.org/?pageID=3&storyNum=41	"O'Connell's mother established the scholarship in honor of her husband, the Boston-area architect T. George O'Connell, for students showing ""outstanding ability in the sciences."" When her mother died in 1982, O'Connell honored her by adding her name to the fund's title. In subsequent decades, she continued to donate to the scholarship fund and remained keenly interested in its recipients. Since 1978, the fund has awarded full- and partial-tuition scholarships to 85 math and science students."	985
385	https://bulegacy.org/?pageID=3&storyNum=41	The family's BU roots stretch back to the late 19th century, when O'Connell's two uncles graduated from the School of Law. Her mother majored in math at the College of Liberal Arts, and O'Connell followed in her footsteps, majoring in chemistry. She later earned master's and doctoral degrees in science education.	986
385	https://bulegacy.org/?pageID=3&storyNum=41	"Before her retirement in 1965, O'Connell taught at Dalhousie University, in Nova Scotia, Old Dominion College, in Norfolk, Va., and Florida State University, among other institutions. But her true passions were traveling and sharing accounts of her travels with others. In a 1983 alumni questionnaire, she crossed out the occupation field and scribbled ""lucrative amusement: travel lecturer."""	987
385	https://bulegacy.org/?pageID=3&storyNum=41	"O'Connell was no casual tourist. She sought what she called ""weird little chunks of Earth,"" taking thousands of photos and collecting cultural artifacts, from African ceremonial masks to Saudi Arabian lunchboxes to Japanese Christmas ornaments. She spent 6 to 10 months each year away from her home in Venice, Fla., journeying to the South Pacific, the Aleutian Islands, and numerous places in between."	988
385	https://bulegacy.org/?pageID=3&storyNum=41	"""She was really a student of cultures and of people,"" says Carrie Cutchens, a friend of O'Connell's and curator at the Children's Museum of Naples, in Naples, Fla. O'Connell's collections of approximately 10,000 slides and more than 2,000 pieces of folk art reside at the museum-as do the more than 100 terra-cotta heads she sculpted of the people she met and photographed in her travels."	989
385	https://bulegacy.org/?pageID=3&storyNum=41	"Those travels took her to every continent and more than 140 countries in search of places where people still practiced traditional folk art-including some potentially dangerous locales. ""Yemen was super and nary a gun cracked within my hearing,"" she wrote in 1986, the year of a violent civil uprising in South Yemen. Once, after taking a photo of a forbidden subject in Iraq, she was pursued by angry Iraqi police. With the help of two British tour guides, she hid in a tour bus bathroom until the police gave up the chase."	990
385	https://bulegacy.org/?pageID=3&storyNum=41	BU officials at times felt the force of her personality. Over the years, O'Connell chided the University for its failure to support an active alumni chapter in Sarasota, Fla., and to provide more information on the distribution of her scholarship funds.	991
385	https://bulegacy.org/?pageID=3&storyNum=41	But the disagreements never undermined her affection for her alma mater. A BU seal, cast in bronze by her grandfather, remained prominently displayed in her living room until her death.	992

The school's approach to teaching was based on the idea that everyone, regardless of their background or prior knowledge, could learn to be a designer or architect.

The band is the brainchild of songwriter Paul Nederostek, who started the project while living in Columbia, SC, formed the band after writing 3 initial songs. These songs laid out a vision and the foundation for the band’s live and recorded sound, reflected in their upcoming debut album. The band, each being seasoned musicians, locked in a heavy groove based upon the songs written by Nederostek alone, and performed throughout the Southeast as a fully formed set up. After moving to Charleston in 2017, Nederostek buckled down and focused on recording and producing the songs that make up the band’s self-titled debut release. The upcoming record is the product of years of perfecting and honing in on production techniques, having mixed and recorded the entirety of the upcoming album with the guidance of co-producer Wolfgang Zimmerman.	998
